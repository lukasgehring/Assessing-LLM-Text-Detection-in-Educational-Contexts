0;Some people think that children should be taught to compete, but others think that children should be taught to co-operate that become more useful adults. What do you think?;It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.;Competition has long been heralded as a driving force behind economic development. It fosters innovation, incentivizes efficiency, and stimulates growth by encouraging businesses and individuals to strive for excellence. In an environment where multiple players endeavor to outperform one another, the result is often a dynamic economy that thrives on fresh ideas and superior services. However, while competition holds substantial benefits for the economy at large, it becomes crucial to examine its implications—not only through an economic lens but also regarding human development, particularly in social contexts.When we pivot our focus from competition to cooperation, a different set of benefits emerges, especially for children. Collaborative environments provide significant opportunities for students to cultivate essential interpersonal skills. These skills, such as teamwork, communication, and conflict resolution, are invaluable as they pave the way for future success in their personal and professional lives. Engaging in group activities and cooperative projects offers children a platform to express themselves, listen to diverse perspectives, and learn the importance of working towards a common goal. Such experiences not only contribute to individual growth but also enrich the fabric of society as these children grow into capable, empathetic adults. Cooperation encourages a sense of community, allowing students to build lasting relationships marked by trust and mutual respect, which are imperative as they navigate the complexities of life.Ultimately, while competition can catalyze economic advancement, the value of cooperation cannot be overlooked, especially in nurturing the next generation. A balanced approach that recognizes the strengths of both competition and cooperation is essential, creating a society that thrives on both innovation and collaboration. This dual perspective is vital in our ever-evolving world, where the ability to work together is just as important as the drive to excel individually.
1;Nowadays, more people are migrating to other countries than ever before. In order to become integrated into society in their adopted countries, immigrants should abandon their old ways and adapt to local customs and codes of behaviour. Do you agree or disagree?;The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.Firstly, maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.Secondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.To conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one’s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society.;Over the last fifty years, immigration has reshaped the cultural landscapes of numerous countries, leading to vibrant multicultural societies. While some advocate that immigrants should adopt local customs to better integrate into their new environments, I firmly believe that preserving one's cultural identity is equally important. Sustaining cultural roots allows immigrants to enrich their host societies while also maintaining their original values.Maintaining cultural identity provides immigrants with a sense of belonging and stability during times of transition. It allows them to cling to traditions, languages, and customs that define who they are. This connection to their heritage can enhance their emotional well-being, fostering resilience as they navigate the complexities of life in a new country. For instance, community gatherings, traditional celebrations, and culinary practices not only remind immigrants of their origins but also create avenues for cultural exchange that benefit the broader society.Moreover, when immigrants sustain their cultural identities, they contribute to the diversity that characterizes multicultural environments. This diversity becomes a resource rather than a barrier, promoting mutual respect and understanding among various groups. Acknowledging and valuing the different backgrounds present in society enriches the cultural fabric of the host country, enhancing its social cohesion.Additionally, retaining cultural values can foster familial bonds and intergenerational connections among immigrant communities. Young immigrants who are exposed to their family’s traditions develop a sense of identity and pride, which can be crucial in navigating the challenges of assimilation. By embracing both the original and adopted cultures, individuals can become bridges between their heritage and their new environment, fostering mutual respect and understanding.In conclusion, while integration into local societies is essential, it should not come at the expense of individual cultural identities. Embracing one's background not only affirms personal identity but also strengthens the multicultural tapestry of the adopted country, ultimately facilitating a more harmonious coexistence.
2;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages and different cultures around the world. While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations. Firstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country’s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists. Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores. These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard. Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country.Secondly, through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected. For instance, in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely ‘Trong Dong’ drum performance and ‘Ha Long’ bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry. Without this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works. Thus, tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes. To conclude, as far as I am concerned, international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries. In addition, the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments.;Over the last decade, international tourism has surged as an increasing number of travelers embark on journeys to experience natural wonders, ancient heritage sites, and diverse cultures. While some argue that this influx of tourists carries negative consequences for destination countries, I contend that tourism significantly contributes to economic development and plays a key role in preserving the culture and environment of these locales.On the economic front, tourism generates substantial revenue for countries, creating job opportunities and stimulating local businesses. Hotels, restaurants, and various service industries thrive on the patronage of tourists, leading to a multiplier effect that benefits entire communities. In many developing nations, tourism is often one of the primary sources of income, enabling governments to invest in vital infrastructure projects such as transportation, healthcare, and education, which ultimately enhance the quality of life for residents.Moreover, tourism promotes cultural preservation and environmental conservation. As visitors seek to explore ancient sites and engage with local traditions, governments and organizations are incentivized to maintain and protect their cultural heritage. Resources allocated to preserving historical monuments and fostering traditional customs result in the safeguarding of unique identities that may otherwise be at risk of disappearing. For instance, indigenous communities often receive support through cultural tourism, allowing them to share their heritage while also generating income.Furthermore, ecotourism has emerged as a sustainable alternative that encourages the protection of natural environments. Tourist interest in pristine landscapes leads to conservation initiatives that combat issues like deforestation and wildlife poaching, allowing local ecosystems to thrive.In conclusion, while critics of international tourism highlight its potential drawbacks, the overall contributions of tourism to economic development, as well as cultural and environmental preservation, cannot be overlooked. By fostering sustainable practices and protecting cultural heritages, international tourism can be a powerful force for good in the world.
3;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide. While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations.Firstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations. Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits. This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism. Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.Secondly, there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals. As the Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat’s anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions. For this reason, many marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species. Thus, it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments.To conclude, I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments. If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future.;Over the past 50 years, the world has witnessed a remarkable surge in international tourism, transforming how people explore and engage with global cultures, landscapes, and historic sites. According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), global tourist arrivals have escalated from 25 million in 1950 to over 1.5 billion in recent years. While this exponential growth brings economic benefits, such as job creation and infrastructure development, it also poses significant threats to the very cultural, environmental, and historical treasures that draw tourists in the first place.The rapid increase in tourist footfall, often in fragile ecosystems or culturally rich areas, stresses local resources and can lead to landscape degradation, habitat destruction, and cultural dilution. Popular destinations such as Venice, Machu Picchu, and the Great Barrier Reef are already experiencing the adverse effects of overtourism, where the influx of visitors outpaces the capacity of the area to accommodate them sustainably. If left unchecked, these beautiful sites risk irreparable damage, which could diminish their allure and value. To safeguard these precious assets, authorities and policymakers must take immediate and cohesive action. Implementing strict regulations on visitor numbers, establishing sustainable tourism practices, and promoting off-the-beaten-path destinations are effective strategies. Furthermore, investing in education and public awareness campaigns about the importance of conservation can empower travelers to engage responsibly with their surroundings.One viable approach is the adoption of a “carrying capacity” model, which helps determine the maximum number of visitors an area can sustain without compromising its integrity. Alongside this, collaboration between local communities, governments, and international organizations is essential to develop adaptive management strategies that emphasize both preservation and tourism. In conclusion, while the past five decades have heralded an era of unprecedented global travel, it is imperative that concerted efforts are made to ensure that these invaluable cultural and natural riches are protected for future generations. Our collective responsibility lies in striking a balance between enjoyment and preservation, ensuring that tourism supports rather than undermines our precious global heritage.
4;The idea of going overseas for university study is an exciting prospect for many people. But while it may offer some advantages, it is probably better to stay home because of the difficulties a student inevitably encounters living and studying in a different culture. To what extent do you agree or disagree this statement? Give reasons for your answer.;It is every student's desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment. While some students study and live overseas to achieve this, some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas. In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.First, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures. Compared to the peers studying in the home country, it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself/herself into new environments and situations in life.Second, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet. One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness, living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life. Moreover, the one will learn living without depending on anyone else.Also, employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills. Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market. Therefore, one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his/her peers.In conclusion, there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas. However, living and studying overseas gives the individual a new perspective on the subject that is studied or in general life.;Studying overseas is an experience that carries both challenges and remarkable rewards. While it is understandable that some students prefer the comfort of studying at home due to the various difficulties associated with living and studying in a foreign country, the benefits of immersing oneself in a new culture and educational system can outweigh these challenges. In my opinion, students who study abroad are afforded unique opportunities that cultivate invaluable skills.Firstly, studying overseas fosters adaptability. When students are placed in a new environment, they must navigate unfamiliar circumstances, from adjusting to different teaching styles to managing day-to-day tasks like shopping and transportation. This adaptability not only enhances their problem-solving abilities but also prepares them to handle unexpected situations more effectively in their future careers.Moreover, studying abroad can significantly improve language proficiency. For many students, immersion in a language-rich environment is the most effective way to achieve fluency. Speaking a foreign language daily accelerates the learning process and allows students to understand the nuances of the language in a cultural context, further enhancing their communication skills.Additionally, living in another country promotes cultural awareness and global perspectives. Engaging with people from diverse backgrounds teaches students about varying viewpoints, fostering open-mindedness and empathy. These characteristics are essential in today’s interconnected world, especially in a professional environment where collaboration with international teams is increasingly common.Finally, studying overseas often encourages greater independence and self-discipline. Navigating life far from home requires students to take on responsibilities that they may not have faced before. This experience helps build confidence and resilience, qualities that are invaluable in both personal and professional realms.In conclusion, while studying at home may offer a sense of security, the myriad benefits gained from studying overseas—such as adaptability, language skills, cultural awareness, and independence—make it a transformative experience that prepares students for their futures in profound ways.
5;Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Studying abroad is one very common thing that students do, and they have different reasons for that. I believe that studying abroad has many advantages. Students gain a lot out of the experience personally, academically, and culturally.First of all, students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country. Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one's character. For example, students might face many challenges in the host country. Therefore, they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter. Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence. One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies. For example, they will get exposed to a different educational system. They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country.Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience. While living in a foreign country, students can learn a lot about the culture of that country. Furthermore, they can meet different people of the country. They can learn about their way of thinking, their customs and traditions, and way of life. Learning about others' cultures is so important. It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world. It makes us more open, and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts. Also it educates us about the world we are living in. In conclusion, studying abroad does not only have advantages, but also can change us in a very positive way. It can influence us in different aspects of life.;Studying abroad is a transformative experience that offers students a wealth of opportunities for personal, academic, and cultural growth. Living in a new country not only broadens one's horizons but also instills essential qualities such as flexibility and adaptability. Transitioning to a different environment allows students to confront various challenges, from navigating unfamiliar social customs to adjusting to different lifestyle norms. As they learn to manage these changes, they often become more resilient and resourceful, which positively impacts their character development.Academically, the experience of studying in a foreign institution enriches students' learning. They are exposed to diverse pedagogical approaches and unique academic systems that may differ significantly from their home country. Engaging with different perspectives on subjects can foster critical thinking and inspire innovative ideas. Additionally, students can benefit from the expertise of professors and the opportunity to collaborate with peers from diverse backgrounds, promoting a richer exchange of knowledge. This exposure can enhance their understanding of global issues and prepare them for careers in an increasingly interconnected world.Culturally, living in a new country is a profound immersion into a different way of life. Students have the chance to experience vibrant traditions, cuisines, languages, and social practices that expand their cultural literacy. This cultural exchange enhances empathy and global awareness, nurturing a deeper appreciation for diversity. As students navigate the complexities of cross-cultural communication, they develop skills that are invaluable in both personal and professional environments, allowing them to engage more meaningfully with others.In conclusion, the experience of studying abroad offers substantial benefits to students on multiple levels. Through the challenges of adaptability, the richness of a new academic landscape, and the appreciation of cultural diversity, students emerge more equipped to navigate the complexities of our modern world, making them not only better learners but also more conscientious global citizens.
6;With the rise in popularity of the internet, newspapers will soon become a thing of the past. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The internet has been more and more popular for recent years, providing people with a huge source of information. As a result of this, print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers. Some people, however, still believe that they can exist for long time; others disagree, arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence. Personally, I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons.First of all, to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers. Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime. As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages. Hence, the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information.Another point is that, from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one. It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries. The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same, even usually less information than those he can have with the internet? The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so. For this reason, the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time.Last, but not least, when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down. This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today. At this point, newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive.In conclusion, it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media. However, this, if occurring, should be seen as a result of the ever-increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole.";The advent of the internet has revolutionized the way information is accessed and consumed, making it increasingly popular in recent years. With just a few clicks, individuals can obtain a vast array of information on virtually any topic imaginable. This convenience and immediacy have led to debates surrounding the future of traditional newspapers. While some individuals assert that newspapers will continue to exist, others argue that they have lost their competitive advantage. Proponents of newspapers contend that they provide in-depth analysis, investigative journalism, and a curated perspective that may be lacking in the vast wilderness of the internet. They believe that well-respected newspapers can withstand the test of time due to their commitment to journalistic integrity. Moreover, there is an argument to be made for the tactile experience of reading a printed article and the engagement it fosters with the material. Readers often cite the comfort of flipping through pages, which allows for a more leisurely and reflective consumption of news.Conversely, a growing number of people argue that the advantages of the internet in disseminating information far outweigh those offered by newspapers. Using the internet, users can access real-time updates and breaking news stories instantly, a luxury that traditional newspapers cannot provide due to their print schedules. Furthermore, online platforms curate information quickly, making it easy for users to find specific content without the need to wade through outdated articles. In addition to being faster, the internet also offers content across diverse formats, including videos, podcasts, and interactive graphics, appealing to a broader audience.Ultimately, as society continues to evolve in its information consumption habits, newspapers face significant challenges. While they may adapt and find their niche, the prevalence of the internet as a primary source of information suggests a potential decline in the traditional newspaper's relevance. The future of news consumption may lie in a hybrid model, but the speed and convenience of the internet, undeniable in its superiority, seem poised to dominate.
7;For successful development of a country, should a government focus its budget more on very young children education rather than universities?;"""Education is the investment in our future"", as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out, education, which fosters a civilized society, plays a significant role in a country's long-lasting prosperity. It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development. As for the two integral components within the system, elementary and advanced education, there's no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both.Concerning that elementary education, like the base of a architecture, is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today's society, government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it. So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy, and this interplay seriously compromises a country's future development. In other words, if countries, especially the developing countries, are determined to take off, one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education.That's not enough, for higher education, which represent the cutting edge of a country's academic achievements, act as the vanguard in economic and social advance. The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community. Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention, but this argument is invalid. Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money, what's more, government's big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide.From reasons listed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that, a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities, both are crucial on the way to a brighter future.";Education is a cornerstone of a civilized society, and it plays an integral role in ensuring a country's long-lasting prosperity. It serves as the foundation for developing informed citizens, equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to contribute positively to their communities and the nation as a whole. Thus, a government must invest not just in higher education institutions, but equally in the early education of young children, as both aspects are crucial for fostering a brighter future.Young children are particularly impressionable and are at a critical stage of cognitive and social development. Investing in early childhood education effectively lays the groundwork for lifelong learning, as it develops essential skills such as critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence. Programs that focus on literacy, numeracy, and social skills equip children to navigate their future academic endeavors and cultivate responsible citizenship. Young learners also benefit from a supportive and enriching environment that encourages exploration and curiosity, which is essential for societal progress. On the other hand, universities play a vital role in a nation's innovation and economic growth. They produce graduates who drive advancements in science, technology, health, and the arts, all of which contribute to national wealth and progress. Some may argue that universities can sustain themselves through donations or entrepreneurial ventures. However, this perspective overlooks the broader societal obligation to maintain accessible and high-quality education for all. Relying solely on private funding can lead to inequalities, where only affluent students gain access to better educational resources, stifling social mobility and hindering progress.In conclusion, a balanced investment in both early childhood and higher education is paramount for a nation's prosperity. It is the responsibility of the government to ensure that all citizens have equal opportunities to succeed, thus fostering a civilized society where everyone can thrive. The future of any nation hinges on its commitment to nurturing the minds and talents of its young people.
8;Many students have to live with roommates while going to school or university. What are some of the important qualities of a good roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to explain why these qualities are important.;"Much has been said about the importance about good roommates and how roommates will affect our life in school. Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considered. In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. Consideration is always important in relationship. For example, roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time. Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine. At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously. Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life. It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member.Moreover, communication is as well making a good roommate. People have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning. One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project. If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk. Therefore, communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation. Through communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others.In conclusion, there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important. Consideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality. However, people might not get what they want all the time. The sky is the limit; there are all kinds of personality out there. We need to be flexible to be account into society.";In the intricate tapestry of shared living experiences, the qualities of a good roommate can significantly impact the overall harmony of a household. In my personal opinion, one of the most crucial qualities of roommates is consideration. This quality encapsulates a fundamental respect for one another's space, time, and personal habits. When roommates exhibit consideration, they create a nurturing environment where everyone feels valued and understood. For instance, being mindful of noise levels during late study hours or acknowledging different schedules can go a long way in fostering a positive living dynamic. A considerate roommate is not only aware of their own needs but also empathetic to those of others, which can translate into a more pleasant cohabitation experience.Alongside consideration, communication stands out as another essential particularity of a good roommate. Open and honest dialogue is the foundation of any successful relationship, and this holds true in shared living situations as well. Effective communication enables roommates to address issues before they escalate, whether it’s discussing chores, sharing responsibilities, or expressing personal boundaries. I believe that establishing a routine check-in, where both parties communicate their needs and concerns, can significantly strengthen the roommate relationship. This not only helps in resolving conflicts but also fosters a sense of camaraderie, as both individuals feel free to share their thoughts and feelings.In conclusion, while there are various attributes that contribute to a successful roommate experience, consideration and communication stand out as the most important qualities. Together, they create an atmosphere of respect and understanding, essential for a harmonious living arrangement. Ultimately, when both roommates prioritize these qualities, they can cultivate a supportive environment that enhances their shared experience, making it not just bearable, but enjoyable.
9;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways) . Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay;Nowadays transportation has attracted much social concern. Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy. It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that governments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment. Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air. Both these two things are important.First and foremost, carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere. The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged. If governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work. This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment. Whereas, if there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released. Obviously, the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth. In addition, the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam. It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities. The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads. In order to tackle the problem, governments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes. There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion.In conclusion, I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around. Nevertheless, public transportation systems even have more important advantages. They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere. That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities.;In contemporary urban environments, increasing traffic congestion has become a pressing issue that demands urgent action. Governments should prioritize spending on public transportation systems such as buses, trains, and subways as a strategic investment that not only alleviates traffic woes but also addresses the critical challenge of environmental degradation. Investing in public transport infrastructure serves multiple purposes. Firstly, it provides a reliable alternative to private vehicles, significantly reducing the number of cars and motorbikes on the roads. Fewer vehicles translate to less congestion, which enhances the efficiency of urban mobility. With reduced traffic, commuting becomes quicker and more predictable, benefitting both the economy and the quality of life for residents. Moreover, easing road congestion can lead to decreased wear and tear on infrastructure, further optimizing public spending in the long run.Secondly, enhancing public transportation systems has substantial environmental benefits. The increase in private vehicle use directly correlates with heightened carbon emissions and environmental pollution. Cars and motorcycles are significant contributors to greenhouse gases, which, in turn, inflict damage on the ozone layer. By promoting reliable and accessible forms of public transport, governments can effectively decrease the reliance on these polluting vehicles, contributing to a cleaner and more sustainable urban environment. In conclusion, the benefits of investing in buses, trains, and subways are multifaceted, extending beyond immediate transportation needs to long-term environmental sustainability. Governments that prioritize public transport pave the way for reduced traffic congestion and a healthier planet. This approach not only safeguards the ozone layer but also enhances the quality of life for urban residents. It is imperative that policymakers recognize the value of this investment for a greener and more efficient future.
10;Some people say that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.Ê;"Although some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics, I truly believe that the physical education part should not be outweighed. Physical exercises help to create healthy nation, assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country. First of all, the ancient Latin proverb says: ""Anima sana in corpore sano"", which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul. There is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises. The more we practice, the better we feel. Additionally, there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity: gradually, step by step we change physical condition to better. So, if the entire nation, from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday, eventually it may help to build healthy nation.Besides, when we practice outdoors and indoors sports, many aspects are getting clearer. For example, when a person goes jogging everyday, eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation. Alike, the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically. Furthermore, almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation, which is a part of physical education. Last, but not least, financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is. For instance, the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare, since the nation is comparatively healthy. Along with that, physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development. As a matter of fact, the better a person feels, the better his brain works. Therefore, putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society. As hence it ends up with financially competitive country.In the conclusion, I would like to say that the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education, the more influence we can get on academic success of students.";"The direct linkage between health and the frequency of physical exercise is an established fact that has significant implications for individuals and communities alike. Engaging in regular physical activity contributes not only to improved physical health but also enhances mental well-being. The adage ""the more we practice, the better we feel"" encapsulates the transformative power of exercise. As individuals commit to a consistent routine of physical activity, they often experience heightened energy levels, reduced stress, and improved mood, which reinforce a positive feedback loop encouraging further participation.Whether it be jogging in a local park, playing team sports in a community center, or practicing yoga at home, both outdoor and indoor exercises play a crucial role in enhancing various aspects of life. For instance, outdoor activities foster a greater appreciation for one’s environment, promote social interaction, and provide a refreshing break from the digital confines of modern life. Conversely, indoor exercises can effectively cater to individual preferences and ensure that physical activity remains accessible regardless of weather conditions. Collectively, these experiences contribute to a more holistic understanding of personal health and community well-being.Moreover, the financial sustainability of a region is often directly correlated with the health of its population. A healthier populace tends to reduce healthcare costs, increase workplace productivity, and enhance economic engagement. Communities with robust health and wellness programs see a return on investment, as healthier individuals contribute positively to the local economy. They are more likely to participate actively in the workforce, engage in social programs, and invest in their communities.In conclusion, the importance of regular physical exercise cannot be overstated. It boosts individual health and well-being while simultaneously fostering the economic vitality of communities. As such, promoting physical activity should remain a priority for policymakers aiming to cultivate a healthier, more sustainable future for all."

Therefore, with the advent of internet and online paying systems, you can do many thing at your home easily.Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments. Biomedical engineers could make a significant effect on increasing life expectancy the world. For example, one of their inventions was related to artificial heart valves which can be count as a turning point in heart surgeries. In the past time doctors used pig heart's valve to implant, but the patient could not be alive more than 3 years after the replacement. But now, biomedical engineers can make artificial heart valves which works well and doctors can implant them easily. To sum up, technology has helped us to have more comfortable life. You can see its effects on transportation, communication, medicine and so forth.;In the age of modern technology, email stands out as one of the most beneficial advancements, particularly in the realm of education and global communication.

12;Agree or disagree:Technology has made children less creative than they were in the past.;Technology accelerates human's evolving pace. With advanced technology, many things that seemed impossible in the past, have become realities. For example, people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen, both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet. However, some people point that technology has made children less creative. I don't deny that technology may have some negative effects on children, but I think technology makes children even more creative.First, technology inspires children to create new things. Children are curious about everything around them, so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone, they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works. For example, Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer, then he did everything he could to understand how it worked. After he had figured out all the stuff, he then began to promote the computer. In the end, he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight. Therefore, instead of interfering children's creativity, technology actually encourages children to learn and to create.Second, technology widen children's knowledge. In the past, children were only able to see things from one perspective. However, with highly advanced technology, children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends. Therefore, they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking. Knowledge is the base of creativity. The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world, inspires children and encourage them to create new things.Admittedly, technology may have negative effects on children. Technology has made life too easy for most children. In comfortable conditions, children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change. Nonetheless, with the development of technology, increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products. They kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age.;The role of technology in children's development is a topic that prompts diverse opinions. While some argue that it has stifled creativity, I assert that technology can indeed inspire children to innovate and broaden their horizons. First and foremost, technology serves as a powerful catalyst for creativity. With the advent of digital tools and platforms, children are provided with unprecedented resources for expression. Programs like coding software, graphic design applications, and video editing tools empower young minds to transform their ideas into tangible projects. For instance, children can learn to create their own video games, animations, or digital art, enabling them to explore their creative potential in ways that previous generations could hardly imagine. This integration of technology into creative processes nurtures inventive thinking and problem-solving skills, which are crucial in today's fast-paced world.Moreover, technology significantly expands children’s access to knowledge. The internet serves as a vast repository of information, allowing young learners to explore a myriad of subjects ranging from science to art and history. Educational platforms and online courses can complement traditional schooling, giving children the opportunity to dive deeper into topics of interest, learn at their own pace, and develop a more comprehensive understanding of the world around them. Such exposure not only enhances their knowledge base but also fosters curiosity and a lifelong love of learning.While it is true that technology can have some negative effects, such as distractions and reduced face-to-face interactions, its capacity to inspire creativity and expand knowledge cannot be overlooked. Instead of casting technology as the antagonist in children's development, we should embrace its potential and guide children in using it constructively. By doing so, we equip the next generation with the tools they need to thrive creatively and intellectually.
13;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone. They all enrich our daily lives. Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten. And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers. It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes. They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it. In this case, students learn things easily. Moreover, they contend that good television programs do teach students. For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc.Personally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source. Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong. Just imagine: if a student can't even make out whether the source is reasonable or not, then how can he get the right information to help him to learn?;"The role of teachers in the education of students has long been a focal point in discussions around effective learning. Many people firmly believe that students at schools and universities benefit immensely from lessons imparted by teachers. This assertion is grounded in the fundamental understanding that educators do not merely convey information; they guide students in acquiring essential skills such as reading, writing, and mathematics from their earliest years in kindergarten.From the moment children step into an educational environment, teachers become pivotal in shaping their academic trajectories. They introduce students to the basic building blocks of literacy and numeracy, nurturing a love for learning that lasts a lifetime. The structured lessons provided by teachers equip students with critical thinking skills and the ability to communicate effectively. Furthermore, educators employ various teaching methodologies that cater to diverse learning styles, ensuring that all students have the opportunity to thrive.In addition to the academic skills imparted in classrooms, teachers also play a crucial role in instilling moral values and social norms. Through discussions, group work, and community activities, students learn the difference between right and wrong, and they begin to understand the importance of ethical behavior and responsibility. These lessons extend beyond textbooks, preparing students to navigate the complexities of life and participate effectively in society.While the advent of technology has introduced alternative modes of learning, such as online resources and self-paced courses, many argue that these methods cannot replace the personal interaction that occurs in a traditional classroom setting. Teachers provide mentorship, encouragement, and a sense of belonging that is often missing in digital learning environments.In conclusion, the consensus remains that teachers are not merely conveyors of knowledge; they are indispensable facilitators of holistic education. Their impact on students transcends academic achievement, deeply influencing character development and lifelong learning."
14;Email and text messaging have transformed communication but they are seriously threatening the status of written language. How far do you agree or disagree with this statement?;The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.First of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.The popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts. Moreover, it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments. If that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand.In conclusion, we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity. Nevertheless, educators and individuals themselves, especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one.;The introduction of email and text messaging has revolutionized the way we communicate, propelling us into a digital age where instant communication is at our fingertips. While these innovations have made it easier to connect across distances and kept our conversations rapid and dynamic, they have also sparked a formidable debate about their effects on written language. Critics argue that the prevalence of informal texting abbreviations and email shorthand may be diminishing the quality and richness of traditional writing skills. As we embrace this new era of communication, the implication of these technologies on the written word warrants attention from educators, parents, and especially the youth.In the traditional sense, written language serves not just as a means of communication but also as a medium of expressing thoughts, ideas, and emotions in a structured and coherent way. Emails and text messages often prioritize speed over formality, leading to a rise in the use of slang, abbreviations, and fragmented sentences. Such informal writing can blur the lines between casual conversation and formal discourse, consequently affecting students’ academic performance and professional writing skills. Educators must, therefore, emphasize the importance of mastering conventional writing alongside digital communication. Integrating instruction on proper grammar, syntax, and style into modern communication curricula is vital for fostering comprehensive literacy in a generation that often equates writing with texting.Moreover, young individuals need to recognize the value of strong writing abilities, which remain a critical component in higher education and the professional realm. By honing their written communication skills, they can articulate their thoughts more effectively, creating opportunities for better engagement and understanding in various contexts. Ultimately, while email and text messaging have changed the landscape of communication, it is crucial for society to preserve and enhance the value of written language to ensure effective communication persists in all its forms.
15;Some people think it is acceptable to use animals for the benefit of the human beings. Some people think it is wrong to exploit animals for the human purposes. What is your opinion?;"With the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.First of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life. To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying. The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life. Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines. Furthermore, it also have potentially harm for human's health without any testing. To sum up, I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals' profits, the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits.";The use of animal experimentation has become a prevalent practice in the advancement of medical science and food development. Increasing numbers of experiments are conducted to ensure the safety and efficacy of new medicines and food products. While many people oppose animal testing on ethical grounds, arguing that it is cruel and inhumane, I believe that the benefits of such practices far outweigh the moral concerns.Proponents of animal testing argue that it is crucial for the development of new treatments and medicines that save human lives. For instance, numerous vaccines and medications we rely on today, from antibiotics to cancer treatments, owe their existence to rigorous testing on animals. Without this critical phase, there is a risk that untested and potentially harmful substances could be released into the market, leading to disastrous consequences for human health. To abandon testing simply under the guise of compassion for animals would be a dangerous oversight, jeopardizing countless lives in pursuit of unverified products.Moreover, advancements in understanding human biology often rely on animal models. Since animals share a significant amount of genetic, biological, and behavioral similarities with humans, they serve as essential tools for researchers. The data obtained from these studies is invaluable for predicting human reactions to new drugs and dietary components. Thus, while the ethical concerns surrounding animal welfare are valid, the implications of undermining scientific progress must also be acknowledged.In conclusion, while animal testing raises moral questions, the necessity of ensuring safe and effective medicines and foods cannot be denied. A responsible approach to scientific research must balance ethical considerations with the imperative of protecting human health. No sensible individual can dismiss the fact that it would be dramatically cruel to humanity to allow the market to flourish with unchecked products. As we continue to strive for alternatives, the reality remains that animal testing plays an integral role in safeguarding our well-being.
16;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinions.;It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television. Nowadays, number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday. Unfortunately, most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television. I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties.In spite of enjoying watching television shows, it is really time consuming task. Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising. We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities. This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday. At the end, there is no time for call to our parents or friends.Second, I think watching television programs makes us lazy. We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office. Hence, we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports. This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable.Last but not least, some television programs have a negative effect on viewers. Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity. These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers. They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors.To sum up, killing our time, making us lazy, and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive. I think it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution.;"Television has long been a primary source of entertainment and information for people around the world. In spite of its appeal, most individuals do not have a structured plan or schedule for watching television, which can lead to excessive consumption of television programs without consideration of time management. The allure of binge-watching captivating shows often overrides the need to devote time to other important tasks and responsibilities, leading to a significant impediment on personal productivity. Moreover, the effects of television extend beyond time consumption; watching television can contribute to a sedentary lifestyle. This inactivity often breeds laziness, as prolonged hours spent in front of a screen discourage physical activity and engagement in other hobbies. A study has shown that excessive television watching is correlated with higher rates of obesity and other health issues due to the associated passive behavior. As a result, individuals may find themselves trapped in a cycle of laziness that hinders both physical health and mental well-being.Additionally, the content of some television programs can have adverse influences on viewers. Certain shows and advertisements glamorize negative behaviors, including criminal activities. This portrayal can shape perceptions and potentially normalize such actions in the minds of viewers, especially in impressionable younger audiences. When these themes are repeatedly presented in a sensationalized manner, they can distort the viewers’ understanding of morality and societal boundaries.In conclusion, while television can be an enjoyable form of entertainment, it is essential to recognize its potential pitfalls. Without a clear plan or limitation on viewing time, individuals risk falling into a pattern of excessive watching that leads to laziness and unhealthy habits. Furthermore, the content consumed can perpetuate negative activities, which is a concerning aspect of modern-day television consumption. It is vital for viewers to be mindful of their watching habits and critically evaluate the media they consume."
17;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field. Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work. This factor is still affecting thinking of many people. They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only. This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender.Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders. Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor. For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky. They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also. Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination. They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission. However, the current job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers. The job selection criteria are pre decided. For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine. They prefer male staff for night shifts. They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc. Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender.To conclude, I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject. Our youth has become very confident towards his career. They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations. Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer. So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal.;In contemporary society, the importance of gender equality resonates throughout numerous sectors, including education. Universities should consider implementing policies that promote gender parity, accepting equal numbers of male and female students. This approach not only reflects a commitment to fairness but also acknowledges the remarkable accomplishments of women across all disciplines, both indoor and outdoor.Historically, women have demonstrated their capabilities in every conceivable field, from science and technology to sports and the arts. The increasing number of female leaders in diverse areas further underscores their potential in higher education and professional environments. By admitting an equal number of students of both genders, universities can nurture a diverse learning atmosphere that empowers all students and helps dismantle longstanding stereotypes about gender roles.Additionally, the current job market significantly influences university admissions and course design. As employers increasingly seek a workforce that mirrors the diversity of the population, universities must adapt their strategies to better align with these demands. Institutions that offer an equal number of spots to men and women showcase a commitment to building a balanced future workforce, equipping all students with the skills and knowledge required to succeed in their careers. Furthermore, universities tailor their programs to meet the evolving needs of employers, making it essential that both genders are equally represented. This not only prepares students for the competitive job landscape but also promotes collaborative work environments reflective of modern workplaces. By adopting gender-equal admissions policies, universities can lead the charge for equity and serve as examples for industries that still struggle with gender imbalance.In conclusion, prioritizing gender equality in university admissions is vital for fostering diverse educational experiences and meeting the demands of today's job market. By accepting equal numbers of male and female students, universities will help cultivate a future filled with innovative thinkers and effective leaders, ultimately benefiting society as a whole.
18;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better?;Many young adults want to get away from their parent's houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits, to be independent. But these young people do not take into account that their lives are going to be more difficult, when they are away from home. They will have to pay a lot of bills, because they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant, who they may not like. Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money. If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan, electricity, water or even for a meal. If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working, because they will not have money to pay for everything. There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home, because parents will take care for them. Moreover, parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying.Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant, who they do not like. His habits may be totally different from theirs, his behavior may be inappropriate, but they will have to live with him or even share a room, in order to have less expenses. Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults. When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view, they will not be able to ask him for advice. Furthermore, they are most likely to quarrel every day, instead of to help each other.In conclusion, I reckon that for the young adults it will be better to live with their parents, because of the benefits they will have. They will not need to worry about financial problems or if they will get on well with their roommate.;The desire for independence is a hallmark of young adulthood, driving many to seek an escape from their parental homes. The appeal of having no restrictions and the thrill of self-governance are compelling. However, the allure of freedom often overshadows the practical realities of living independently, which can be significantly more challenging than anticipated.One of the primary motivations for young adults to move out is the yearning for autonomy. Living under their parents' roof often comes with rules and expectations, which can feel stifling. The prospect of setting their own schedules, making personal decisions, and enjoying privacy is enticing. Nevertheless, the transition to independence involves more than just personal freedom. Young adults must navigate the complexities of adult life, including budgeting, cooking, cleaning, and managing various responsibilities that were once managed by their parents.Moreover, while leaving home may initially seem financially liberating, it often brings unforeseen financial burdens. Rent, utilities, groceries, and other living expenses can quickly add up, leaving many young adults grappling with financial strain. These financial challenges are compounded by the possibility of roommate conflicts. The transition from familiar family dynamics to sharing space with roommates can be tricky, requiring negotiation, compromise, and effective communication skills—capabilities that many young individuals may still be developing.While some argue that living independently prepares young adults for the real world, it is essential to weigh the benefits against the costs. Instead of escaping home solely for freedom, young adults should consider the importance of financial stability and emotional preparedness. Planning ahead and possibly adopting a gradual approach to independence could mitigate many challenges. Ultimately, the journey to adulthood should be balanced with practicality to ensure a smoother transition into the complexities of independent living.
19;Some people believe that the government is responsible for cleaning up the environment while other people belief it should be the responsibility of companies and private individuals. Whats you opinion? ;Air pollution is an issue threatening the environment in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the negative way. I believe that more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution. First, in most industrialized countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions. The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution. While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses, most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution. If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution, they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause.Second, private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating. As house heating is a major need in the winter time, some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes. Instead of this, some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution. In my opinion, by charging private individuals for causing air pollution, that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution. On the other hand, I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies. Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air, instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals. In conclusion, due to the fact that governments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution, both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution.;Air pollution is one of the most pressing environmental issues of our time, impacting ecosystems, human health, and contributing to global challenges such as climate change. The emissions of harmful pollutants from vehicles, industries, and even household products can lead to the depletion of the ozone layer, which protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet rays. Furthermore, these pollutants are major contributors to global warming, exacerbating the already critical situation of climate change. In light of these daunting challenges, I believe that both individuals and companies should take on more significant responsibilities for mitigating air pollution, while governments also need to implement stricter regulations.More accountability should be placed on private individuals and companies to pay for the cleanup of air pollution. Since many contribute to the problem through their daily activities and production processes, it is only fair that they assist in addressing the consequences. For instance, companies could be mandated to invest in clean technologies and sustainable practices as part of their operational costs, thereby fostering a culture of responsibility towards the environment. Individuals, too, can participate by adopting cleaner habits, such as using public transportation, carpooling, or transitioning to electric vehicles, which would contribute to reducing the overall pollution footprint.On the other hand, governments play a crucial role in this equation by implementing bans and restrictions on products that are significant sources of air pollution. Regulations on industrial emissions, promotion of renewable energy sources, and the establishment of stricter vehicle standards are vital. Policies that encourage the use of green technology can facilitate the transition towards a cleaner environment. By enforcing these measures, governments not only safeguard public health but also set a precedent for responsible behavior in both companies and individuals.In conclusion, addressing air pollution requires a collective effort that emphasizes accountability at all levels. By imposing greater responsibilities on individuals and corporations while keeping a robust regulatory framework, we can work towards a cleaner, healthier planet for future generations.
20;High sales of a product are mainly due to good advertisment strategies. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;Everyday, companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers. The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising. However, it is not sufficient in itself. The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers. In my opinion, advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons. We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements. Therefore, advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product. When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised, they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases. Recently, there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV. The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot. As a result of this, the number of that product being sold will increases. Also, the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media, the more popular the product becomes. Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product. Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product. When a product is commonly used, it becomes trustworthy for the society, no matter what quality it is. However, it also has to be affordable for the consumer. Considering this fact, advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised. They make the product preferable. In conclusion, as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods, high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements.;"Advertising has long been considered a cornerstone of marketing strategies, wielding the power to influence consumer behavior and drive purchasing decisions. The effectiveness of advertising lies in its ability to create awareness and generate interest in products, utilizing various mediums such as television, social media, and print. This strategic communication aims not only to inform consumers about a product but also to persuade them by appealing to their emotions, desires, and aspirations. However, while compelling advertising can capture attention, it is essential to recognize that it is not a standalone solution for ensuring sales.For advertising to convert interest into actual purchases, the product itself must satisfy the genuine needs and desires of consumers. An appealing advertisement may draw a consumer's attention, but if the product fails to deliver on its promises or does not align with the consumer's expectations, the initial intrigue may quickly dissipate. Instead, true customer loyalty is fostered by products that resonate with consumers on a deeper level, addressing their specific needs, preferences, and concerns.In many cases, successful advertising serves as a reflection of a well-rounded approach to product development and customer understanding. Brands that prioritize the needs of their consumers while simultaneously investing in creative, impactful campaigns are often the ones that achieve sustained success. The synergy of effective advertising and high-quality products creates a cycle of consumer trust and satisfaction, further reinforcing the brand’s reputation. In conclusion, advertising undoubtedly plays a pivotal role in persuading consumers to make purchases; however, it is only part of the equation. To achieve lasting impact, products must genuinely meet consumer needs. The most powerful advertisements not only captivate audiences but also echo the quality and reliability of the products they promote, offering a harmonious balance between marketing and real consumer value."
21;Some people believe a country will benefit greatly by a high percentage of young people go to university. Others argue that it only leads to unemployment. Discuss both and give your own opinion.;"Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university. In regard to the development of the country, some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities, while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment. In this essay, I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.To begin with, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons. From their point of view, the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, and, furthermore, labors for graduates are in short supply. What is worse, the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying. In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming.However, on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine. These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world. More importantly, many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society. Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships.To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities' education have reasonable justifications; however, I agree with the latter view. Although higher education does not guarantee young students' success, the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges.";In today’s society, the debate surrounding the value of a university education is becoming increasingly polarized. Advocates of the impracticability of university often argue that the rising costs of tuition and student debt outweigh the benefits of obtaining a degree. Many believe that the job market favors practical skills over academic credentials, suggesting that individuals can acquire necessary skills through alternative means, such as vocational training, online courses, or on-the-job experience. Critics of the traditional university model point out that the rapid changes in technology and industries render some degrees obsolete, leading to a perceived reliance on theoretical knowledge rather than practical application.Conversely, proponents of university education emphasize its multifaceted benefits, which extend beyond mere vocational training. They assert that universities provide essential skills for diverse careers, fostering critical thinking, problem-solving, and effective communication. Furthermore, universities serve as vital environments for academic exploration, encouraging innovative ideas and research while nurturing personal growth and social development. The exposure to varied perspectives within a university setting can also promote better understanding and collaboration in increasingly diverse workplaces.When analyzing both perspectives, it becomes clear that a one-size-fits-all approach does not suffice. The decision to pursue higher education should hinge on individual goals, career aspirations, and the specific demands of the job market. While a university may not be the best fit for everyone, it can provide substantial advantages for those seeking deeper academic engagement or entering fields that require specialized knowledge. Ultimately, it is crucial to acknowledge the diversity of pathways available for success in today’s economy, fostering a balanced approach that values both traditional education and alternative forms of skill acquisition. This nuanced understanding will guide individuals toward informed decisions that align with their personal and professional objectives.
22;There are social, medical and technical problems associated with the use of mobile phones. What form do these problems take? Do problems of using mobile phones outweigh the benefits?;Nowadays, the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well, such as social, medical and technical problems. However, I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones. In this essay, I would like to analyze these three issues in order to support my viewpoint.First of all, almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems. Mobile phones are not out of expectation. Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas, such as schools, libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive. What is worse, some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other. Nevertheless, it is not impossible to solve these problems, as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented.It is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal. It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers, although the further investigation are needed.Another debatable problem is about techniques. There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party. This possibility exists all the time. But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users.Moreover, the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people's daily life. Not only used for communication, but it also functions as an Internet browser, a music player, a personal organizer and so forth.In conclusion, nothing can be overused without side effects. The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people's dependence on it is irreversible, although it has a number of problems that should be well handled.;The popularity of mobile phones has undeniably transformed the way we communicate, access information, and manage our daily activities. While these devices have brought convenience and connectivity to our lives, they have also introduced a range of problems that merit examination. In this essay, I will discuss three significant issues related to mobile phone usage—disruptive behavior in public spaces, cheating in educational environments, and negative impacts on interpersonal relationships.First and foremost, one of the most prominent issues is the disruptive behavior associated with loud phone conversations in public areas. Places like schools, libraries, and hospitals serve specific purposes that require a degree of silence and respect. However, individuals who speak loudly on their phones in these settings often create an atmosphere of discomfort and distraction. This not only diminishes the experience for others but is also perceived as inconsiderate and offensive. Such behavior reflects a lack of awareness or respect for the social norms that govern shared spaces.Secondly, the misuse of mobile phones extends into academic environments where some students resort to using their devices as sophisticated cheating tools during examinations. With access to the internet and various apps, students can easily seek answers discreetly. This undermines the integrity of the educational process and devalues the accomplishments of honest students. The increasing incidence of cheating fueled by mobile technology raises concerns about the future of academic integrity and the long-term implications for both educational institutions and the workforce.In conclusion, while mobile phones have enhanced our lives in numerous ways, their prevalence has also given rise to significant issues that cannot be overlooked. From disrupting public spaces with loud conversations to facilitating dishonesty in academic settings, these problems highlight the need for greater awareness and responsibility in our mobile phone usage. Society must strive for a balance that maximizes convenience while minimizing the negative consequences of this pervasive technology.
23;Using computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on your children? do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, thanks to the development of technology, computer is now indispensable to life. Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently. In my opinion, the latter opinion is true.First, using computer constantly has bad influence on children's eyes. When they concentrate on computer for too long, their eyes will get tired, which is the main reason for some eyes problems, typically shortsighted.Moreover, children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills, they will know little about the outside life. It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear dangerous consequences. For instance, several teenagers play games without rest, which leads to health depression, a typical example is the death of Korean gamer, who had a non-stop playing for 3 days.Finally, even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much. Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose, most of them are attracted by facebook, blog, etc. instead. Due to this neglect, they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet, they will have no time for their studying.In conclusion, although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life, it still has its bad side, especially for children. People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose.;The debate regarding the use of computers by children is ongoing, with strong opinions on both sides. Proponents argue that computers are beneficial for children's education and can be valuable tools for learning. They assert that daily use can enhance skills such as research, problem-solving, and creativity. Furthermore, many educational programs and applications are designed to engage children in interactive learning, making education more enjoyable and accessible.However, there is a growing concern about the negative effects of excessive computer usage on children. In my opinion, constant use of computers can have detrimental impacts, particularly on children's eye health. Extended screen time can lead to digital eye strain, causing symptoms such as dryness, discomfort, and blurred vision. As children often lack awareness of the need for regular breaks, their health can be significantly compromised due to prolonged exposure to screens. Thus, it is crucial for parents and guardians to monitor and regulate computer usage.In addition to health concerns, excessive gaming and screen time can hinder the development of essential communication skills. Children who spend significant hours engaged in virtual gaming may miss crucial opportunities for face-to-face interactions. The reliance on screens for entertainment can lead to social withdrawal and challenges in building relationships, which are vital components of emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills. Consequently, the lack of real-world communication experiences can limit their ability to navigate social settings effectively as they grow older.In conclusion, while computers can offer educational benefits, the potential adverse effects on children's eyes and communication abilities cannot be ignored. It is essential for parents to strike a balance, ensuring that technology is used in moderation, fostering both learning and social development.
24;Large factory near your community. Advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community.;Nowadays, whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society. Out of the case of economic development, industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society. However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution. From my point of view, the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories.First of all, a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. To manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit. What is more, the factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area. For example, the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need.The main disadvantage is contamination. It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems. For instance, in some industrial cities, a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances.However, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. Therefore, how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it. In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well.In conclusion, installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries. Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way.;Building factories has long been a cornerstone of industrial development, providing both opportunities and challenges. While concerns about environmental impacts are valid, I argue that the advantages of constructing a factory can outweigh its disadvantages if we proactively address the associated environmental problems.One of the most significant benefits of establishing a factory is its potential to stimulate local economic growth. Factories create jobs, which in turn can reduce unemployment rates in communities. As employment opportunities increase, so does the purchasing power of residents. This heightened economic activity can enhance local businesses, foster entrepreneurship, and ultimately drive innovation. Moreover, a factory can attract other industries and services to the area, creating a positive feedback loop that further enhances economic vitality.However, it is essential to acknowledge that the development of factories invariably presents environmental challenges. Factories can contribute to pollution, habitat destruction, and resource depletion. Nevertheless, with advancements in technology and increasing awareness of sustainable practices, we can mitigate these environmental issues. For example, implementing renewable energy sources, waste reduction initiatives, and eco-friendly manufacturing processes can significantly diminish a factory's ecological footprint. Furthermore, engaging in community collaboration to develop strict environmental standards can ensure that factories operate sustainably.As our society progresses, the establishment of more factories is inevitable. As such, it is crucial to embrace this development while simultaneously fostering an environmentally conscious approach. By prioritizing sustainability alongside industrial growth, we can strike a balance that allows for economic and social advancement without disregarding the health of our planet.In conclusion, the benefits of building factories, particularly in terms of economic growth and job creation, can outweigh the drawbacks if we effectively tackle the resulting environmental challenges. By embracing responsible practices, we can achieve a future where industry and environmental stewardship go hand in hand.
25;Food is now easier to prepare. Is this a good thing?;Nowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.First of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food. Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up.In addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.In conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing. Cooking is not a waste of time, contrarily, it is crucial for our health and culture.;In contemporary society, the convenience of prepared foods has become a staple in many households. However, this trend is accompanied by significant negative consequences that stem from the reliance on artificial ingredients, neglect of nutritional balance, and alterations in our eating habits. The implications are profound and merit careful consideration.One of the primary concerns regarding prepared foods is the prevalent use of artificial ingredients. These additives are often introduced to enhance flavor, improve texture, or extend shelf life. Yet, many of these substances lack nutritional value and can even pose health risks. Consumption of these artificial elements may contribute to chronic illnesses and dietary deficiencies, which are increasingly common in today's fast-paced lifestyle. A reliance on prepared foods thus compromises our overall health and well-being.Moreover, prepared foods frequently prioritize convenience over nutrition. With these products, individuals often overlook the considerable benefits of whole, unprocessed foods, which are essential for maintaining a balanced diet. By skimping on fresh ingredients, many people inadvertently diminish their intake of vital nutrients that are crucial for optimal health. This disregard further fuels the alarming rise in obesity and lifestyle-related diseases, leading to long-term health ramifications that could have been mitigated through better dietary choices.Additionally, the reliance on prepared foods can significantly impact traditional cooking habits. As the convenience of ready-made meals becomes the norm, essential cooking skills are gradually lost. This erosion of culinary knowledge not only reduces the ability to prepare nutritious meals but also disassembles the cultural connections and familial traditions that accompany home cooking. Ultimately, the more prepared food we consume, the more we risk alienating ourselves from wholesome dietary practices and meaningful culinary experiences.In conclusion, while prepared foods serve the purpose of convenience in our busy lives, they ultimately bring forth negative consequences. The reliance on artificial ingredients, neglect of nutrition, and erosion of cooking skills underscores the necessity for a more balanced approach to our diets, integrating fresh ingredients and fostering culinary skills to promote a healthier lifestyle.
26;The best and only way to assist developing countries is to provide them with financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;As is commonly understood, there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries. It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries. However, it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries. This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters.Firstly, education is an essential part in development. For instance, most developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities. From this example, it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support. Thus, the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid.In addition, it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world. This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market. Indeed, they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas. Therefore, developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries.In conclusion, financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries. And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation.;"In recent years, numerous developed countries and organizations have extended financial assistance to impoverished nations, primarily with the objective of fostering education and economic development. The necessity of enhancing educational systems in these countries cannot be overstated. By investing in education, developing nations can cultivate a skilled workforce capable of driving economic growth and improving societal well-being. Quality education equips individuals with critical thinking skills, enhances their employability, and empowers them to contribute meaningfully to their communities.However, the motives behind this financial assistance are often multifaceted. While the façade of altruism dominates discussions surrounding aid, it is essential to recognize that there is typically a reciprocal expectation. Donor countries may seek to cultivate diplomatic ties, secure favorable trade agreements, or bolster stability in regions critical to their national interests. For instance, educational investments can lead to the expansion of a country's influence in global affairs. Thus, while support for education can yield significant benefits to developing nations, it is important to acknowledge that such initiatives are often intertwined with strategic objectives.The phrase ""there's no free lunch"" underscores the reality that support comes with inherent costs. Nations provide assistance with the hope of cultivating favorable outcomes that align with their geopolitical or economic interests. This dynamic raises questions about the true nature of the assistance: is it pure benevolence, or is it ultimately a strategic investment aimed at ensuring stability and growth in the donor countries?In conclusion, financial assistance from developed nations serves both the developmental needs of impoverished countries and the strategic motives of the donors. By improving education in developing nations, donors not only contribute to poverty alleviation but also pursue their own interests in a complex and interconnected global landscape. The challenge lies in balancing these interests to foster genuine development without compromising the sovereignty and agency of the recipient nations."
27;Society should ban all forms of the advertising because it has no purpose and causes damages. Do you agree or disagree? ;It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life. We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday. Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing. Other critics say that ads have no purpose, they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned. On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way. Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers.First of all, I do support the idea that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children. Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis. Fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.On the other hand by advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services. Thanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose what’s the best for us.These days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising. For example, tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy. In order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers. Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country.In conclusion, I think that modern society needs advertising. Ads will keep us well informed about new products and services, but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way.;The debate surrounding the regulation of advertising, particularly concerning alcohol, cigarettes, and goods or services with adult content, is crucial, especially regarding the potential negative impact these advertisements can have on children. Youths are particularly impressionable, and exposure to such content can normalize unhealthy behaviors and attitudes. When children frequently encounter ads promoting alcohol or smoking, they may view these behaviors as socially acceptable or even desirable. The consequences of such perceptions can lead to early experimentation with substances, contributing to significant public health issues.On the other hand, the advertisement plays a fundamental role in the modern economy. Companies, firms, and individuals leverage advertising as a key strategy to promote their goods and services. This form of communication drives competition, fosters innovation, and ultimately benefits consumers by providing them with a diverse array of choices. Additionally, advertising serves as a vital source of revenue for many businesses and supports the livelihood of countless individuals working in marketing and media industries. Governments also depend on advertising as a way to inform citizens about public services, health initiatives, and safety campaigns.The challenge lies in finding a balance between promoting economic growth through advertising and protecting the wellbeing of children. While businesses should be allowed to market their products, it is imperative that there are stringent regulations on how and what can be advertised to young audiences. This can include implementing age restrictions, limiting the placement of such advertisements in media consumed by children, and requiring clear health warnings. By prioritizing the safeguarding of children while still allowing for economic activity, society can work towards a healthier environment for future generations while maintaining the benefits that advertising brings to the marketplace.
28;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think that women should work to earn money whereas other people belief that women should care about household. What's your opinion?;Personally, I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly. Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household. I will mention some basic reasons as following.Firstly, extra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses. By taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life. This is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present. So, it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money.Secondly, working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity. These things in turn will make them more confident, independent. These women will set a good example for their children. Therefore, it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better.Last but not least, nowadays, there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work. Besides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women.In conclusion, a well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home.;In modern society, the landscape of gender roles has evolved significantly, allowing married women to pursue careers on par with men. Employment discrimination based on gender has decreased substantially, empowering women to take up jobs that were once predominantly occupied by men. This newfound freedom not only contributes to economic stability but also enriches the lives of families.By entering the workforce, married women can earn their own income, thereby providing additional financial support for their families. This economic contribution helps to alleviate the financial burden often placed solely on husbands and promotes a sense of shared responsibility. As women take on various roles in their professions, they enhance their families’ financial situations and contribute to the overall growth of the economy.Moreover, working outside the home presents married women with opportunities to engage with the wider world, which can greatly boost their self-esteem and personal development. These experiences broaden their perspectives and help them to develop a robust character. Interacting with colleagues, clients, and the community fosters social skills and resilience, leading to a well-rounded individual who can tackle challenges both at work and home.Furthermore, married women who represent strong professional and personal values become exemplary role models for their children. By witnessing their mothers balance work and family life, children can learn the importance of hard work, perseverance, and equality. These lessons are invaluable, encouraging the next generation to respect and value the contributions of both genders in the workplace.In conclusion, the advancements in gender equality have allowed married women to enter the workforce and achieve professional success. By doing so, they not only enrich their family lives with financial stability but also serve as inspiring role models for future generations. The societal shift towards embracing women’s rights in the workplace represents a positive step forward for families and communities alike.
29;The government has to provide primary and secondary education, but for university education either students or their parents should pay. To what extent do you agree?;"Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world. I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people; however, for the more higher education like university, the students or their parents should pay for the fees.Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees. In the other hand, I don't think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students' primary and secondary education. It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education.Moreover, students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it. They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves. In addition to that, the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well.Furthermore, this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future.In conclusion, I completely agree that government should not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them.";In contemporary society, the role of government in facilitating education is fundamental. It is widely accepted that primary and secondary education should be provided by the government as a basic right. This ensures that all citizens, regardless of their socioeconomic background, have access to essential knowledge and skills necessary for personal and professional development. The universal right to education during these formative years is crucial for fostering equality, enhancing informed citizenship, and preparing individuals for their future roles in society.However, the debate becomes more complex when discussing higher education, particularly university tuition fees. There is a growing argument that students or their parents should bear the financial responsibility for university education. Governments allocate significant resources to provide foundational education, and extending financial support for higher education can lead to overextension of public funds. Moreover, the higher education system often benefits individuals who are likely to gain higher earning potential, thereby making the case for personal investment in one's education.Yet, it is essential to acknowledge the financial burden many families face when it comes to university fees. Not all parents have the means to support their children’s aspirations for higher education, creating a disparity that could disadvantage capable students from low-income backgrounds. This raises ethical questions about accessibility and equality of opportunity in higher education. While it is vital for governments to manage their budgets prudently, it is equally important to find a balanced approach that supports disadvantaged students. Solutions could include scholarships, grants, or subsidized loan programs that ensure everyone has the opportunity to pursue higher education without crippling financial debt. In conclusion, while the government should step back from funding university education entirely, a hybrid model combining personal investment with targeted assistance for those in need can foster a more equitable educational landscape.
30;The first car appeared on British roads in 1888. By the year 2000 there may be as many as 29million vehicles on British roads. Alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Recently, a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation. Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation, while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution. In my opinion, I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced. In this essay, several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages.Firstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. Therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.Secondly, an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion. Once we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while. What is worse, traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents. Thus, the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented.In order to solve these problems, alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively. With regard to the former, alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal. For example, rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries. This system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee. Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, it is a better form to protect environment than automobile. As for the latter point, the introduction of international laws can be also effective. For instance, there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only. Thus, these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution.In summary, even though some people claim the convenience of automobile, I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion.;"Transportation plays a crucial role in modern society, facilitating the movement of people and goods. In this context, automobiles have garnered considerable attention for their convenience and efficiency. However, a growing number of voices advocate for alternative forms of transport due to concerns over environmental pollution. This essay will explore the merits of both viewpoints, focusing on the implications of automobile reliance and the potential benefits of sustainable transportation options.Automobiles have become synonymous with convenience. They offer unparalleled flexibility, allowing individuals to travel at their own pace and explore diverse destinations without the constraints of public transport schedules. The automobile industry has continually innovated, resulting in vehicles equipped with advanced technology for safety and efficiency. However, this convenience comes at a significant cost; the environmental impact of widespread automobile usage is profound. The emissions from cars contribute to air pollution, while the demand for oil has led to numerous environmental and geopolitical challenges. Thus, the sustainability of this form of transport is increasingly questioned.In contrast, alternative modes of transportation, such as cycling, walking, public transit, and electric vehicles, present viable solutions to mitigate environmental damage. Public transport systems can reduce the number of vehicles on the road, subsequently lowering greenhouse gas emissions and urban congestion. Additionally, promoting cycling and walking not only fosters healthier lifestyles but also contributes to decreasing reliance on fossil fuels. Electric vehicles, while still reliant on energy sources, represent a significant improvement over traditional cars, leading the way towards a greener future.In conclusion, while automobiles offer unparalleled convenience, the environmental implications of their extensive use cannot be overlooked. Embracing alternative forms of transportation not only addresses pollution concerns but also encourages healthier, more sustainable urban living. Therefore, it is imperative to consider a balanced approach that integrates various transportation methods to create a more environmentally responsible future."
31;Rich countries should provide financial help to poor contries. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;"In this world, there is no one who does not know this world 'globalization', which means the world are more closer, and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways. That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries. It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries. In addition, a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries. However, I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons.First of all, poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer. To be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies. Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business. In actual, republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's. Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties.Secondly, aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people. If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted. It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization.Third, the campaigns might include practical benefits. In globalized world, the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others. When America mortgage loan system went bad, several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated, even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt.In conclusion, there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people, keeping strong global economy. I strongly believe that being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers, and it will make the earth a better place to live.";Aiding poor countries has been a subject of intense debate, but the positive effects of such assistance overwhelmingly outweigh its side effects for several compelling reasons. Firstly, many poor countries grapple with severe shortages of basic materials and facilities necessary for economic development. These nations often lack adequate infrastructure, healthcare services, and educational institutions, which are essential for nurturing a conducive environment for businesses to thrive. When wealthier nations provide aid — whether through financial support, food, or access to technology — they supply these critical resources that can kickstart local economies. This support not only enables communities to meet their basic needs but also fosters an environment where entrepreneurship can flourish, leading to wealth generation and poverty alleviation.Secondly, aiding campaigns create greater awareness and consideration for the plight of impoverished populations. By highlighting the struggles faced by individuals in poor countries, these initiatives encourage both governments and citizens in wealthier nations to adopt a more compassionate outlook and engage in global solidarity. This leads to a societal shift that values humanitarian efforts, ultimately promoting policies that address global inequality. Lastly, many aid campaigns include practical benefits that can have profound, long-lasting impacts. For instance, investments in education and healthcare not only empower individuals but also establish a more skilled workforce capable of driving economic growth. Additionally, initiatives that provide resources for sustainable agricultural practices can enhance food security, improving the quality of life in vulnerable regions. In conclusion, while there may be some criticisms of foreign aid, the advantages it brings to poor countries, including improved infrastructure, heightened awareness of global struggles, and tangible benefits through various programs, demonstrate a significant positive impact. Ultimately, aiding poor countries lays the foundation for self-sufficiency and prosperity, making the case for continued support compelling and necessary.
32;Even though globalization affects the world's economics in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"During the history of the world, every change has its own positive and negative sides. Globalization as a gradual change affecting all over the world is not an exception. Although it has undeniable effects on the economics of the world; it has side effects which make it a controversial issue.Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country. They think that the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments.Those who disagree, believe that globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects. Developing globalization, people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world. In addition, they admit that globalization can be considered a chance for people of each country to promote their lifestyle through the stuffs and services imported from other countries.Moreover, the proponents of globalization idea point out globalization results in considerable decrease in global tension due to convergence of benefits of people of the world which is a natural consequence of globalization.In conclusion, I would rather classify myself in the proponents of globalization as a speeding factor of global progress. I think it is more likely to solve the problems of the world rather than intensifying them.";Globalization is a multifaceted phenomenon that has sparked considerable debate regarding its impact on ethnic and religious values. On one hand, some individuals perceive globalization as a threat to their cultural identity. The rapid spread of Western ideals, consumer culture, and technological advancements can erode traditional values and practices, leading to a homogenization of cultures. This fear is particularly pronounced among communities that have deep-rooted customs and beliefs, as they struggle to maintain their unique identities in the face of pervasive global influences. For instance, indigenous cultures may find their languages and rituals overshadowed by more dominant cultural narratives, which can lead to a loss of heritage and community cohesion.Conversely, many argue that globalization fosters positive change by promoting cross-cultural exchanges and mutual understanding. Through interconnectedness, societies have the opportunity to share knowledge, innovations, and technological progress that can enhance living standards and education. The cultural exchange facilitated by globalization can lead to greater tolerance and appreciation of diversity, as people learn from one another and see the value in different perspectives. Moreover, globalization has contributed to economic growth in various regions, creating jobs and improving infrastructure, which can ultimately benefit local communities.In contemplating the dual nature of globalization, it becomes evident that its effects are complex and nuanced. While there is valid concern about the potential erosion of ethnic and religious values, it is equally important to recognize the opportunities that globalization presents for cooperation and growth. Ultimately, the outcome of globalization is contingent upon how societies navigate these changes—prioritizing cultural preservation while embracing the benefits of interconnectedness is vital for a balanced approach that honors both tradition and progress. Thus, the ongoing dialogue about globalization should focus on finding ways to harness its potential while safeguarding cultural identities.
33;Many children are forced to stay at school and study subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. These children may disrupt the education of the majority and should be allowed to leave school early to find a themselves a job. What are your views?;Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future. Others, however, think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school.First of all, schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying. It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things. Second of all, schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students. Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences. Therefore, they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future. For example, as we know, employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills.Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job. Whether children can learn a lot at school, there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. Furthermore, children can learn social skills when they have a job. They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school. Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned.Overall, I believe that students should study at school. Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job, studying at school is always the best choice for children's future. There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job.;The debate surrounding whether children should focus on their education in school or leave early to pursue job opportunities is a contentious one. Many believe that formal education is crucial for equipping children with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate the complexities of adult life. In my view, I align with the perspective that students should be compelled to study at school, as it lays a strong foundation for their future.First and foremost, education is essential for fostering critical thinking, problem-solving, and social skills. Schools provide structured environments where children can engage with diverse subjects and learn from qualified teachers. This exposure helps them discover their interests and talents, while also preparing them for various career paths. A well-rounded education is widely recognized as a key determinant of success, as it offers students the ability to adapt in an ever-changing job market.Furthermore, early entry into the workforce can have detrimental effects on a child’s development. Children who leave school prematurely may miss out on vital life skills and experiences that are crucial to personal growth. The rigors of school teach discipline, accountability, and teamwork, which are equally important in professional settings. Those who are allowed to abandon their studies in favor of work may find themselves trapped in limited job opportunities with little chance for advancement.Moreover, education has long-term implications for society as a whole. A more educated populace leads to lower crime rates, improved health outcomes, and increased civic engagement. By ensuring that students stay in school, we are investing in a more informed and capable society.In conclusion, while the desire to enter the workforce early may seem appealing, it is essential to prioritize education. Schools play a vital role in preparing children for their future, equipping them with the necessary tools for lifelong success. Thus, it is crucial to encourage students to complete their studies before embarking on a professional journey.
34;Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we can see advertisements everywhere, from television set to posters on the streets. Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television. I tend to agree with this view.To boost their sales and win over customers, companies pour a great amount of money into advertising. Most of the time, it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product. By which I mean, huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product. By casting famous singers in their television advertisement, motorcycles or clothes for example, sales increase significantly since youngsters, as the target consumers, love celebrities. Since having these products shows their status, the quality obviously is not relatively important.However, despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated, it is also true that it plays and important role economically. They introduce new products, and provide various choices, not to mention they are often visually enjoyable, since they aim to grab your attention. Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels, creates a fair environment for commercial competition. Otherwise the market may be monopolistic, and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective.The power of advertising maybe over-rated, we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers. No matter how appealing the advertisements are, we should be able to make the decision on our own.;Advertisements have long been a topic of debate, with some arguing that they manipulate consumers into purchasing unnecessary products that may only appear desirable on screen. Critics often contend that many advertisements are laced with exaggeration and deception, leading consumers to develop unrealistic expectations. It is true that television commercials and online ads can portray products in an overly flattering light, creating a façade that may not meet the reality of everyday use. This notion supports the argument that many items sold are superfluous, prompted more by effective marketing than by genuine need.However, despite these criticisms, the importance of advertising cannot be understated, especially from an economic perspective. Advertisements serve a crucial role in the introduction of new products to the market, enabling consumers to discover innovative goods that may significantly enhance their quality of life. Whether it's a groundbreaking technological gadget or an environmentally-friendly household item, advertising provides a platform for new concepts to reach potential buyers. Additionally, advertisements offer consumers a multitude of choices, empowering them to make informed decisions tailored to their preferences and needs.Moreover, advertisements are often visually captivating and creatively crafted. They can provide entertainment and spark inspiration, showcasing artistry in a way that engages viewers. The aesthetic appeal of advertisements, from compelling visuals to catchy jingles, can elevate the consumer experience beyond mere transaction, creating a cultural dialogue around products and their use.In conclusion, while advertisements may indeed sometimes promote unnecessary purchases and create unrealistic expectations, their role in the economy and popular culture is significant. They introduce new products, offer a variety of choices, and add a layer of enjoyment to consumerism that can be beneficial when approached critically and thoughtfully. The relationship between advertisements and consumers is complex, warranting a balanced understanding of both their potential pitfalls and their undeniable contributions to society.
35;Why should the ownership of guns be limited?;Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries. However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others. Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns. The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns. For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting. So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.Secondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people. Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues. Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting. What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.Thirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide. In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent. Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.In conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.;Guns occupy a controversial position in contemporary society, often regarded as not merely another consumer good, but as a potential catalyst for violence and tragedy. This perception is particularly evident given the stringent regulations surrounding firearm ownership in many countries. My viewpoint aligns with the belief that enforcing gun control is a sensible approach, particularly in light of rising accident rates, violent crime rates, and suicide rates associated with firearm use.The statistics surrounding gun-related incidents are alarming. According to various studies, accidental shootings have seen significant increases, highlighting the dangers associated with unrestricted access to firearms. These accidents often involve children or individuals unaware of the risks posed by unsecured weapons. The seemingly simple act of owning a gun can unexpectedly pivot from responsible ownership to a tragic incident, raising critical concerns about the necessity of regulations designed to prevent such occurrences.Moreover, gun violence remains a pressing issue in various regions, where soaring crime rates are frequently linked to easy access to firearms. The consequences of this accessibility are dire: communities are plagued by fear, and innocent lives are lost, often due to impulsive actions spurred by heated emotions or gang-related conflicts. Stricter gun control measures can act as a bulwark against these incidents, ensuring that firearms are kept out of the hands of those who might misuse them.In terms of mental health, firearms are tragically linked to suicide, with research showing that access to a gun significantly increases the likelihood of a fatal outcome during a suicidal crisis. By enforcing stricter controls on gun ownership, we can mitigate these risks, ultimately saving countless lives.In conclusion, while the debate over gun rights persists, it is evident that firearms are anything but ordinary goods. The rise in accidents, violent crimes, and suicides intertwined with gun use clearly demonstrates the urgent need for comprehensive gun control measures, which can foster a safer society for all.
36;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;International sporting events are a good change to create a multi-nation community of fans having the same passion. It will help people around the world understand each other more. Since, international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.An international sporting event is normal held in a country with huge interest from fans all over the world. For the time of occasions, people regardless of nationality, origin and religion will live together. People can understand more about a country, it is useful to ease tensions between nations. For example in FIFA World Cup 2010, the relation between North Korea and South Korea is dangerous for the warship sinking. The world suspected North Korea of the aggressive action. However, due to this event North Korea showed a friendship and enthuasism. It is rare times when people can learn about this country. It really help to alleviate the tension.Besides easing tensions, an international sporting event also helps fans release patriotic emotions in a safe way. When they garther together to encourage their team, they will show their patriotic emotions. Regardless of the competition between teams, their emotions are always released in a safe way due to the sole passion of the sport. Moreover, all fans know that a sport event will attract the attention of whole the world and a lot of public media. They will try to create a beautiful image about their land and people. In Olympic Beijing 2008, Chinese tried thier best to bring the world a spectacular image about their country. First of all, foreigners came here always received the support of friendly volunteers who were young students. They were welcomed by each Chinese hospitality, beauty in each cities. Everythings is created by patriotic emotions of Chinese who wanted to bring a beautiful China to the world.In conclusion, International sporting events will draw the international concern. It will make the world more peaceful by easing internation tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.;International sporting events serve a vital role in fostering global unity and reconciliation, particularly during times of heightened international tensions. Events such as the Olympics, FIFA World Cup, and various international tournaments capture the world's attention, transforming nations into temporary allies as they gather to celebrate athleticism and sportsmanship. These occasions provide a unique platform where countries can set aside their differences, promoting peace and cooperation among diverse cultures.The spirit of competition inherent in international sports allows nations to channel their patriotic emotions in a constructive manner. Instead of engaging in confrontational rhetoric or hostile actions, fans are encouraged to support their teams, don their national colors, and cheer passionately. This shared experience creates a sense of camaraderie not just among supporters from the same country, but also between those from opposing nations, as they collectively engage in the festivities of the event. Scholars, such as Yang, argue that this safe release of patriotic fervor minimizes the risks of conflict, providing an alternative outlet for national pride.Moreover, sporting events often bridge cultural divides by showcasing not only the skills of athletes but also the rich traditions of different countries. The ceremonies surrounding these events, featuring diverse performances and local customs, enable nations to appreciate each other's uniqueness. Spectators, both at the venue and watching from afar, engage with cultures they might otherwise overlook, fostering mutual respect and understanding.In conclusion, international sporting events play a crucial role in easing international tensions while allowing fans to express their patriotic emotions in a safe and celebratory environment. By highlighting connections rather than differences, these events nourish the potential for peace and solidarity in an increasingly divided world, making them indispensable in contemporary society.
37;Some people believe that the range of technology available to individuals today is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people, while others say that technology has the opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Technology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.In the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one. Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies. Thus, most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people.Secondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.Undoubtedly, everything has two sides and technology is not an exception. To some extent, the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology, because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return. Nevertheless, I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap.In conclusion, the good technology bringing to us is undeniable. Under proper use of technology, the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it.;The proliferation of technology in public life has sparked debate over whether it exacerbates the divide between the rich and the poor. While some argue that access to advanced technologies benefits the wealthy disproportionately, I find it challenging to fully endorse this viewpoint. There are compelling reasons to believe that technology can serve to diminish the wealth gap instead.First and foremost, advancements in material technology have led to a significant reduction in the prices of a wide array of products. In the past, items such as home appliances, communication devices, and even essential tools for trade were often prohibitively expensive for the average consumer. Today, however, innovations in manufacturing and distribution mean that many technological goods are far more accessible. As competition increases and production processes become more efficient, prices continue to drop, allowing individuals from various socioeconomic backgrounds to benefit from what were once luxury items. This democratization of technology enables poorer populations to elevate their standard of living.Furthermore, technical developments enhance productivity, freeing individuals from the burdens of mundane daily tasks. This shift empowers people to allocate their time and energy toward pursuits that are more rewarding and fulfilling. For example, automation and advanced software allow workers to streamline their processes, reducing the amount of time spent on menial tasks. Consequently, individuals can invest their newfound time into education, skill development, or entrepreneurial ventures—activities that can lead to personal and financial growth. This capacity to engage in more meaningful work ultimately promotes social mobility and helps bridge the economic divide.In conclusion, while concerns about technology reinforcing existing disparities are valid, I believe that its potential to lower prices and boost productivity can significantly contribute to a more equitable society. By providing access to affordable products and empowering individuals through increased efficiency, technology can play a positive role in reducing the gap between the rich and the poor.
38;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;For many centuries, outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study. Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful. However, a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money, to illustrate, astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment. On the other hand, there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space.Firstly, many facts about solar system can be discovered. For instance, a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat. Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa. If it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts.Secondly, people can know more about the planet earth itself. By observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth. With this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming.Finally, a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented. As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks. Oxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater. Moreover, spaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society.As a conclusion, I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space. In spite of costing a fortune, space exploration has given aforementioned benefits.;"Space exploration remains a contentious topic, with a significant number of individuals viewing it as a frivolous expenditure of resources. This perspective often stems from pressing social issues, such as poverty, healthcare, and education, which seem to demand immediate attention and funding. Critics argue that billions of dollars allocated to space missions could be redirected toward solving these pressing terrestrial issues. However, this view overlooks the myriad benefits that space exploration brings to humanity.First and foremost, the exploration of outer space has provided invaluable insights into the nature of our own planet. A prime example is the iconic imagery of Earth taken from space, which undeniably showcases that our planet is spherical rather than flat. This fundamental understanding shifts our perspective on humanity’s place within the cosmos and fosters a sense of global unity. It serves as a humbling reminder of our fragility and interconnectedness, especially evident in the stunning images captured by astronauts on missions, such as the famous ""Earthrise"" photograph from the Apollo 8 mission.Moreover, studying Earth from space has profound implications for understanding our atmosphere. Satellite technology enables scientists to monitor climate change, track natural disasters, and forecast weather patterns with unprecedented accuracy. Such knowledge is critical in the fight against global warming and can significantly enhance disaster response strategies, ultimately saving lives and resources on the ground.In conclusion, while the financial commitment to space exploration may seem extravagant, the broader benefits it offers are substantial. By venturing beyond our planet, we can enhance our understanding of Earth’s systems, promote global awareness, and inspire future generations to pursue science and innovation. The investment in space exploration is not merely an expenditure; it is an investment in our collective future."
39;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In present day and age, students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university. This phenomenon, although in some extents, are proved to have negative effects, I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages. In this essay, some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained.It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs. Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities. In addition, that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities. As a result, students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience. Moreover, having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation.Secondly, students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones. By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained. Also, working conditions require students the independency in thinking, working, and solving problems, which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities.Lastly, doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation. Indeed, high studying tuition, added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students. With the money they earn from extra jobs, which normally is not much, those difficulties could be partially solved. Moreover, that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life.In conclusion, I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits. By taking on an extra job, students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience, confidence and accommodation. It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future.;In the present day and age, students are increasingly exposed to extra jobs from the moment they step into university. This trend, while not without its drawbacks, offers significant benefits that often outweigh the disadvantages. Engaging in part-time work provides students with invaluable practical experience that complements their academic pursuits.One of the most compelling advantages of taking on extra jobs is the opportunity for students to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world contexts. For instance, a business student who works as a cashier or in a marketing role gains firsthand insight into customer interactions, sales strategies, and the challenges faced in the workforce. This hands-on experience not only enhances their understanding of classroom concepts but also prepares them for future employment by equipping them with essential skills.Moreover, juggling academic responsibilities alongside a job teaches critical life skills such as time management, organization, and prioritization. Students learn how to balance their schedules effectively, an ability that serves them well both in their current studies and in their future careers. Additionally, working part-time often helps students develop a strong work ethic, resilience, and perseverance—qualities sought after by employers.While there are potential downsides, such as stress or decreased academic performance, these challenges can often be managed with careful planning and support. In fact, many students find that their work experience enhances their academic performance by providing a sense of purpose and motivation.In conclusion, the advantages of taking on extra jobs as a student far outweigh the disadvantages. The blend of practical experience, skill development, and personal growth offers students a competitive edge in today’s job market. By embracing these opportunities, students not only prepare themselves for successful careers but also cultivate a more holistic educational experience.
40;Some schools send their students to institutions/organizations for a short to do some unpaid work. To what extent is it beneficial to the students and the organizations/institutions?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies, and then I would draw a conclusion at the end.To begin with, students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to. In most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom. As a result, students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation. For this reason, the internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy.As for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money. In addition, the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan. Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training. Therefore, companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation.To sum up, students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say.;The increasing trend of students undertaking unpaid internships has sparked considerable debate about the implications and benefits for all parties involved. This essay aims to discuss how students and organizations benefit from such arrangements, alongside the financial advantages to companies that offer these positions.For students, unpaid internships represent a crucial opportunity to gain real-world experience in their chosen fields. Through these placements, they can develop practical skills that are often unaddressed in traditional academic curricula. Engaging in hands-on work not only enhances their resumes but also helps them to build valuable networks within their industries. Furthermore, these experiences can clarify career pathways, as students gain insights into the workplace dynamics and expectations, enabling them to make informed decisions about their future careers.From the perspective of organizations, hosting students can yield several benefits. Students often bring fresh perspectives and innovative ideas that can invigorate a company’s projects. Their enthusiasm and willingness to learn can contribute to a productive environment, often inspiring existing employees. Additionally, companies develop potential talent pipelines, fostering relationships with emerging professionals who may become qualified candidates for paid positions in the future.While it cannot be overlooked that companies save substantial sums of money by utilizing unpaid interns, this financial aspect, while advantageous, should be approached with caution. It raises ethical concerns about labor rights and equitable treatment. Organizations must ensure that the internships provide meaningful learning experiences rather than merely serving as a source of inexpensive labor.In conclusion, unpaid internships present a beneficial framework for students and organizations alike. By fostering skill development, networking opportunities, and potential future employment, they offer invaluable experiences that extend beyond immediate financial gains for companies. Balancing these elements is crucial to ensure that the practice remains fair and equitable for all parties involved.
41;Paying more money is the only possible motivation to make employees work harder and to increase their productivity. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this.A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places. Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile. For instance, junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want. If the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan.Nevertheless, I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances. Take Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce. By doing this, the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured.To sum up, I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees. Alternatively, providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses.;The dynamic between employee motivation and productivity is a multifaceted topic that often leads to the assumption that salary increases are the primary catalyst for enhanced work performance. While it is undeniable that a raise or promotion can significantly boost employee morale, it is essential to explore other ways of fostering motivation in the workplace beyond financial incentives.First and foremost, it is crucial to recognize that different individuals are motivated by different factors. For some, monetary compensation may be a top priority, but for others, intrinsic motivation is far more influential. Providing employees with opportunities for professional development can create a sense of ownership over their work, leading to higher levels of engagement and productivity. By investing in training programs or supporting skill development, employers can show their commitment to the personal and professional growth of their staff.Additionally, a positive workplace culture plays a key role in fostering motivation. Recognition, praise, and a supportive environment can greatly enhance an employee’s sense of belonging and purpose at work. When employers acknowledge their employees’ efforts and celebrate their achievements, it builds a sense of community and loyalty that often trumps financial incentives alone.Moreover, allowing flexibility in work arrangements has proven to significantly increase productivity. Many employees value work-life balance, and adjustments in schedules, such as remote work options or flexible hours, can lead to improved job satisfaction. Acknowledging the diverse personal needs of employees can foster an environment of respect and trust, leading to enhanced productivity.In conclusion, while salary increases and promotions are undoubtedly effective ways to boost morale among employees, they are not the sole methods for achieving a motivated and productive workforce. By fostering a culture of recognition, professional development, and flexibility, organizations can cultivate a workforce that is not only hard-working but also genuinely invested in their roles.
42;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. Do you agree or disagree?;For most folks on Earth, the need to gather in one place, and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation. This trend is so deeply engraved in people's mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned, even when some participants are facing grievous social problems. It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation. This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace, and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols.Firstly, during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event. For example, when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers. This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality. Thus, world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace.Secondly, these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country. For instance, when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field. South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night. This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team. As a result, it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events.In conclusion, after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries, it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness. This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future.;"Large-scale sports events, such as the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup, hold a unique power to nurture international camaraderie by diverting attention from conflicts and fostering national pride. These gatherings serve as a common ground where nations can set aside their differences and engage in friendly competition, underscoring sports as a vital link to peace. When countries participate in these events, the focus shifts from geopolitical disputes to the celebration of athletic prowess, unity, and shared human experiences.Throughout history, sporting contests have demonstrated their ability to promote diplomacy and cooperation. For instance, during the Cold War, the Olympic Games provided a platform for rivalry without the consequence of warfare, allowing nations to showcase their athletes and their cultures in a peaceful manner. The slogan ""The Olympic Truce"" embodies this spirit, advocating for a cessation of hostilities during the Games. This tradition highlights how sports can serve as an effective conduit for dialogue and mutual respect among nations, steering attention away from international disputes.Moreover, large-scale sports games cultivate national pride, encouraging citizens to display their national symbols and celebrate their heritage. The sight of fans donning jerseys, waving flags, and singing their national anthems creates a palpable atmosphere of unity and belonging. This enthusiastic display fosters a sense of identity that can transcend domestic issues, uniting citizens in support of their athletes. The exhilaration of witnessing one’s country compete for glory resonates deeply within the national psyche, emphasizing that, through sports, individuals can find commonality in their ambitions and aspirations.In conclusion, large-scale sports events wield significant influence in promoting international peace and enhancing national pride. By shifting the focus from disputes to exhilarating contests, these gatherings not only unify fans across borders but also create a sense of collective identity. Such events remind us of the enduring power of sports as a vehicle for harmony and national representation."
43;Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion.;The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past. It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly. I will analyze these areas in the essay.Firstly, the major source of energy today is water. Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source. To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India. If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity. Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.Secondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming. For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming. In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.To conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy. This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming. Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy.;Water is often viewed as one of the most vital resources on Earth, and currently, it serves as a major source of energy through hydroelectric power generation. Hydropower harnesses the energy produced from flowing water, converting it into electricity that powers homes, industries, and entire nations. Despite its potential, the world faces a stark paradox: while many countries heavily rely on hydropower for their energy needs, water scarcity persists, raising concerns about the sustainability of this energy source.In many regions, particularly in developing countries, the dependence on hydroelectric power remains a fundamental aspect of their energy strategy. Governments invest in the construction of dams and reservoirs to create energy that can help them achieve economic growth and development. However, this reliance poses challenges, especially in areas that are experiencing significant drought or have limited freshwater resources. The need for continuous water flow to generate hydropower competes with other essential uses such as agriculture, drinking water, and ecological preservation.Moreover, while hydroelectric power is often heralded as a clean source of energy, it is crucial to recognize that the predominant energy sources used globally—such as coal, oil, and natural gas—release substantial amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These emissions are a leading contributor to global warming, exacerbating climate change and its associated effects such as extreme weather, sea-level rise, and biodiversity loss. This dependence on fossil fuels highlights the urgent need for a diversified approach to energy generation that includes renewable sources like solar, wind, and geothermal, alongside hydropower.In conclusion, the reliance on water as a primary energy source presents both opportunities and challenges. While hydroelectric power can be part of a sustainable energy mix, addressing water scarcity is crucial for future energy security. Countries must balance their energy needs with the imperative to protect our precious water resources and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Moving toward a more diversified and environmentally friendly energy portfolio is essential for lasting sustainability.
44;The government should aid unemployed people by direct financial help. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Unemployment is clearly a global problem, be it in developed countries or developing ones. However, I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out.Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only. Tax revenue is collected from those who works. Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers. Besides, there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, so addressing unemployment should have low priority.Also, it is obvious that, to survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well. If they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all.Of course, this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance. They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support. In this case, the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work. After all, it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again.In conclusion, my point of view is that, although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people, direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity.;"Unemployment is undeniably one of the most pressing global issues, affecting both developed and developing nations alike. While it manifests through various socio-economic channels, the consequences often linger with severe impacts on individuals and society at large. However, I tend to believe that addressing unemployment is primarily the responsibility of disadvantaged citizens themselves, rather than solely relying on the government for assistance.The philosophical underpinnings of self-reliance suggest that individuals must take active steps in securing their own livelihood. Unemployment often stems from a lack of skills, education, or adaptability to changing job markets. Therefore, disadvantaged citizens should prioritize personal development by seeking education, vocational training, and upskilling opportunities. In this sense, the onus lies on individuals to identify and rectify their shortcomings. Many community programs and online resources are available, ranging from mentorship initiatives to online courses aimed at boosting employability, which individuals can actively engage in.Moreover, self-initiative fosters resilience and personal growth, traits essential for navigating the complex job landscape. When citizens take responsibility for their economic situation, they empower themselves to create their own opportunities, thereby contributing to local economies. Moreover, active participation in job fairs, networking events, and volunteer work can yield connections that lead directly to employment.However, dismissing the role of government entirely would be shortsighted. A collaborative approach is necessary; governments can provide essential support through policies that facilitate job creation, social safety nets, and education reforms. But the primary impetus should originate from individuals seeking to improve their circumstances.In conclusion, while unemployment is a significant global issue, it is essential for disadvantaged citizens to take personal responsibility in confronting this challenge. By actively engaging in self-improvement and seeking opportunities, individuals can break the cycle of unemployment, thereby fostering a more resilient and empowered workforce."
45;Some people think that universities should provide graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace. Others think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer. What, in your opinion, should be the main function of a university;Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise. Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts: where more and more is known about less and less. Nevertheless, among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life. However, although I respect the universities' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause, I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.A university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge. High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.On the other hand, universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather. It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed. So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.In conclusion, the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources. It would be helpful, however, if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures.;A university serves as a vital institution for the dissemination of knowledge, playing a crucial role in shaping the intellectual landscape of society. At its core, a university is a medium through which ideas, skills, and expertise are shared, fostering critical thinking and innovation among its students. However, the traditional perception that a university must provide a fixed curriculum of courses to meet every student's needs is increasingly being challenged by the dynamic nature of today’s world.In common sense, the essence of a university lies not in the rigid programming of courses but in its capacity to provide access to knowledge when it is needed. This perspective aligns with the rapidly evolving job market and the diverse interests of students. With advances in technology and the rise of online learning platforms, students now have the flexibility to pursue knowledge and skills tailored to their unique aspirations. This freedom allows for a more personalized educational journey, where learning can occur through an array of channels, including workshops, seminars, and self-directed study.Furthermore, the notion of just-in-time learning underscores the importance of making resources and expertise accessible rather than confining students to predetermined pathways. Universities are ideally positioned to curate a rich repository of resources, offering students the tools they need to seek knowledge independently. Rather than offering a one-size-fits-all education, the focus should shift towards creating an environment where learning is adaptive, responsive, and readily available, thus empowering students to take ownership of their educational experience.In conclusion, while universities undeniably have a critical role in education, the future lies in redefining their purpose. By prioritizing the accessibility of knowledge and fostering a culture of lifelong learning, universities can better equip students for the challenges of the contemporary world, highlighting that education is not merely about courses, but about empowering individuals to learn when and how they need it.
46;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos. From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.To begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings. Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.Nevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside. They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting. However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat. It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression.;Zoos have long been viewed as institutions dedicated to the conservation and protection of wildlife. However, recent discourse suggests that they may serve more as a hindrance than a help in the effort to save species from extinction. Critics assert that zoos can often act as more of a killer than a protector when it comes to wildlife conservation. This perspective hinges on the idea that the artificial environments of zoos, coupled with the exploitative nature of capturing animals for exhibition, disrupts natural behaviors and undermines species' chances of survival.Rather than relying on zoos to safeguard animals, proponents argue that establishing and enforcing strict laws prohibiting poaching can provide a far more effective solution. These regulations, along with robust legal frameworks, would create an environment where various species can thrive in their natural habitats without the threat of human exploitation. Natural reserves and protected areas would allow wildlife to flourish free from disturbance, ensuring that ecosystems remain intact and that the delicate balance of nature is maintained. Furthermore, these preserved environments would foster genetic diversity and natural behavior, which are crucial for the survival of many species. Unlike the cramped cages and artificial stimuli found in many zoos, natural habitats offer animals the space and conditions necessary for healthy reproduction and social interactions. Such a sanctuary approach respects the intrinsic value of wildlife and allows for a more ethical form of conservation.In conclusion, the reliance on zoos as protectors of wildlife can be fundamentally flawed. Instead, implementing and upholding strict anti-poaching laws, coupled with the establishment of natural reserves, can significantly enhance the fight against extinction. By embracing this more humane and sustainable approach, we can better protect the world's flora and fauna in their rightful, thriving environments.
47;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees. From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions.To begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world. In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation. Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide. Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students. Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains.Nevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases. However, discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished.;In recent years, online teaching has emerged as a transformative force in higher education, offering substantial benefits that should compel colleges and universities to adopt it more widely. One of the most significant advantages of distance learning is the unparalleled convenience it provides to students across the globe. Unlike traditional classroom settings, where geographical location and rigid schedules can act as barriers, online education allows learners to access course materials and lectures from anywhere and at any time. This flexibility is especially beneficial for non-traditional students, such as working professionals or parents, who might find it challenging to commit to a fixed class schedule.Moreover, the advent of video conferencing technology has revolutionized the delivery of education. Tools such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet enable educators to engage with larger student bodies without the constraints of physical classroom space. This capability not only makes it feasible for institutions to reach a more extensive pool of students but also fosters a diverse learning environment where ideas and perspectives can be shared across different cultures and backgrounds. As instructors can simultaneously connect with hundreds, or even thousands, of students, the potential for collaborative learning experiences and networking opportunities expands significantly.Additionally, online teaching platforms often offer an array of resources—such as recorded lectures, interactive quizzes, and forums for discussion—that enhance the overall learning experience. These digital tools facilitate a more personalized approach to education, allowing students to learn at their own pace and revisit complex topics as needed.In conclusion, the widespread integration of online teaching in colleges and universities should be embraced for its immense convenience and capability to reach and engage a larger student audience. As educational landscapes continue to evolve, embracing these technological advancements will be pivotal in creating a more accessible, inclusive, and enriched learning environment for all students.
48;Some people have benefited from modern communication technology, but some people have not benefited from it at all. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones, e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication.To begin with, mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business. With the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds. Furthermore, it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world. With a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine. Therefore, it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind.Nevertheless, opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits. They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money. Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services. Consequently, people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies.By way of conclusion, I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases; however, the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn't afford it.";"In recent years, the advent of modern communication technologies, including mobile phones, e-mails, and internet chat programs like MSN Messenger, has profoundly transformed the way we interact and connect with one another. These innovations have enabled instantaneous communication, transcending geographic boundaries and fostering a global village where ideas and cultures can flow freely. However, there is ongoing debate regarding the overall impact of these technologies, with some arguing that their benefits are not universally accessible.Proponents of modern communication technologies emphasize the advantages they bring to our daily lives. Instant messaging, for example, allows for real-time conversations, enabling more dynamic and personal interactions. E-mails have streamlined professional communication, making it easier to collaborate across distances. Mobile phones have not only improved the convenience of communication but have also empowered individuals to access information and services on-the-go. These advancements have created a platform for knowledge sharing, professional networking, and enhanced relationships, both personal and professional.Nevertheless, critics highlight a significant flaw in this progress: the digital divide. They argue that the benefits of modern communications are primarily enjoyed by the more privileged, thus exacerbating existing inequalities. Access to smartphones, reliable internet, and computer literacy are prerequisites for engaging with these technologies. In many developing regions, individuals may still lack basic access to these tools, leaving them isolated from the benefits of the digital world. This discrepancy raises concerns about inclusivity; those without access are at risk of being left behind, potentially creating a two-tiered society.In conclusion, while modern communication technologies have undeniably enhanced our lives in many ways, it is essential to acknowledge the disparities in access that exist. The challenge lies in ensuring that all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status, can benefit from these innovations, fostering a more equitable society that harnesses the power of communication for all."
49;Some people argue that musical lessons should be made mendatory in high school sducation while others argue that it's a wast of time for students. What is your opinion?;Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject, while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional. In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides.It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology. Therefore, many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music. I have an impression that students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time. In this case, music can be a useful and interesting solution. Moreover, if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life. In fact, students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music. Consequently, the calm atmosphere in the class might be created.By contrast, it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students. In our hectic life, however, demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees. Hence, I agree with the majority, because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it. Increasingly however, students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously. Therefore, music and other entertaining subjects should be optional. Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace. To my mind, students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song.In conclusion, I think that in order to be a competitive worker, students must know their field in an advanced level. On the other hand, music can help an individual to shape its character. An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory.;The debate surrounding the inclusion of music as a core subject in high schools has generated diverse opinions. While many argue for its necessity in the curriculum, others advocate for its relegation to an optional status, emphasizing the importance of occupation-related subjects for students' professional development. I align more closely with the latter perspective, believing that high schools should prioritize subjects that directly contribute to students' future career prospects.Proponents of music education often cite its benefits in fostering creativity, enhancing cognitive development, and promoting discipline. They argue that music can serve as a powerful tool for personal expression and cultural appreciation, providing students with an enriching experience. Indeed, music has proven to have a positive impact on student engagement and can even aid in the mastery of other academic subjects. However, the reality of today’s job market demands that students focus on acquiring skills that are directly applicable to their future careers.As students transition from high school to higher education or the workforce, they need to be equipped with relevant knowledge in areas such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), as well as practical skills related to business or vocational training. These subjects not only enhance employability but also foster critical thinking and problem-solving abilities that are essential in a rapidly changing economy.While music undoubtedly holds value, treating it as an optional subject allows students to pursue their passions without compromising their academic and professional growth. By focusing on occupation-related subjects, schools can better prepare students for the realities of adult life, ensuring they possess the skills and knowledge required to thrive in their chosen careers. In conclusion, I advocate for a curriculum that prioritizes practical skill development, reserving music for those who wish to explore it as an extracurricular interest.
50;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Universities should give the same amount of money to their students' sport activities as they give to their university libraries.;Libraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success. Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities. In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else.First, I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university. All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because, after internet, library plays an important role in research. Although sport is important, it does not have the same priority of library has. In addition only small part of students attend sport activities. For example, in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities.Second, usually libraries do not have income. Most libraries are free not for students also for public. Hence, universities support is vital for libraries. But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors. Also, they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets. To conclude, there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses, but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income.Last but not least, investing in libraries has a long-time result. For example, a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers. Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time. Besides, in the far future, they become more valuable. On the other side, most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time.In spite of the importance of sports activities, libraries are more important. They are critical part of universities and a good university has to have a modern library.;Universities are multifaceted institutions that strive to provide a comprehensive educational experience for their students. Among the various elements contributing to academic success, libraries and sports activities undeniably hold crucial roles. However, I firmly believe that universities should prioritize investing in libraries above all else.First and foremost, the library is a vital and strategic component of any university. It serves as the backbone of knowledge, offering an extensive array of resources that support students’ learning and research needs. A well-equipped library fosters an environment of intellectual curiosity and engagement, allowing students to access a wealth of information across diverse disciplines. This access not only enhances academic performance but also supports critical thinking and lifelong learning skills essential for future success. Furthermore, the library acts as a hub for collaboration among students, promoting study groups and fostering connections that enhance the learning experience.In addition to its strategic importance, it is noteworthy that libraries typically do not generate income. Unlike sports activities, which can attract sponsorships and generate funds through ticket sales and merchandise, libraries rely heavily on institutional support and funding. This disparity highlights an urgent need for universities to recognize the library’s role not just as a resource, but as an essential service that demands adequate funding to maintain and expand its offerings. Investing in libraries ensures that they remain up-to-date with technological advancements and are able to provide a broad range of materials, including digital resources, which are increasingly vital in today's information-rich environment.In conclusion, while sports activities play a significant role in university life, it is imperative to recognize the foundational importance of libraries in fostering academic success. By prioritizing investments in libraries, universities can ensure that they provide a robust educational experience, preparing students to excel both academically and professionally.
51;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;"With the development of globalization, English became the dominated language in national trade, conference and many important events. This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public.Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people. First of all, it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly. In the ancient time, the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas. Fortunately, the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers. If we can popularize the use of English, the language hinder will disappear as well. In addition, English is a beautiful language, which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages. Learning English can foster people's sentiment and nourish their literature and art.However, the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct. Even English is a sophisticated language; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries, which have totally different linguistic system. It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people's daily life, which is influenced by culture, environment as well as religious. Obviously, these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity.Personally, English as an elegant language should be advocated in many fields to expand the global trade and communications. But, we still need preserve other languages for sake of keeping the linguistic and cultural diversity.";The global prevalence of English has sparked a passionate debate regarding its benefits and drawbacks. On one side are proponents who argue that English acts as a lingua franca, fostering communication and collaboration across cultures. As the world increasingly becomes interconnected through trade, travel, and technology, a common language like English can bridge gaps and facilitate understanding. It empowers individuals to access diverse knowledge, share ideas, and enhance career opportunities, making it an invaluable tool in a globalized world.However, opponents of the dominant status of English raise valid concerns. They argue that the widespread use of English threatens cultural diversity and leads to the extinction of less-used languages. Many rich and unique languages are at risk of disappearing as younger generations may prioritize English over their linguistic heritage. This phenomenon diminishes the cultural identities tied to these languages and ultimately homogenizes global culture.Moreover, while English is indeed a sophisticated language, it falls short in expressing the subtleties and nuances of life in many Asian countries. Languages such as Mandarin, Hindi, and Thai each embody distinct cultural concepts, expressions, and emotional depth that are often lost in translation. For instance, certain terms and expressions rooted in cultural practices may lack direct counterparts in English, leading to misunderstandings and a diluted representation of diverse experiences.In conclusion, while the benefits of English as a global language are undeniable, it is imperative to recognize its impact on cultural diversity. A balance must be struck to ensure that while we embrace English for practical communication, we also preserve the rich tapestry of languages and cultures that define our world. Protecting linguistic diversity is essential for fostering a harmonious and multifaceted global community, ensuring that all voices are heard and valued.
52;Some people believe that humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit, while others argue that the rights of animals should be protected.;Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain. He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself. Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, while others are concerned that animals should not be misused. This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication.Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them. Likewise, other animals such as, horses, cattles and donkeys for farming, agriculture and as a mode of transportation. Many people keep pets like dogs and cats, trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples. They are kept for security purposes in houses.On the other hand, many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits. For instance, cows are often injected by Oxytocin, a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation. This in turn, causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle. Furthermore, thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products. Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights. Many other practices like, equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster. And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals.From my prospective, human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters. Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime.;The use of animals for human needs has sparked an ongoing debate between those who advocate for animal utilization and those who express concern over animal welfare. On one hand, proponents assert that animals serve crucial roles in agriculture, scientific research, and even companionship. These supporters argue that domesticated animals contribute significantly to human life through food production, transportation, and various forms of labor. They see these roles as mutually beneficial, where animals receive care in exchange for their contributions.Conversely, a growing number of voices are warning against the potential for exploitation and abuse inherent in how animals are treated by humans. Many farmers and owners push animals to their limits, often prioritizing profit over welfare. This exploitation can manifest in overcrowded living conditions, inadequate medical care, and neglect of basic needs, leading to physical and psychological distress among animals. Such practices raise ethical questions about the responsibilities humans have towards our fellow beings. Furthermore, the prevailing attitude of dominion over animals can be reexamined. Rather than seeing ourselves as lords or masters over the animal kingdom, it is imperative that we adopt a guardian mindset. This approach frames humans as caretakers who are responsible for ensuring the well-being of animals in our care. By respecting their needs, recognizing their emotions, and protecting their habitats, we honor the intrinsic value of animal life.In conclusion, the dichotomy between animal utilization and animal welfare demands a balanced perspective. While animals can serve humans in various capacities, it should never come at the expense of their well-being. Humane treatment, ethical treatment practices, and a strong sense of guardianship are essential for fostering a society where both human and animal interests can coexist harmoniously. This allows for a future where welfare-oriented coexistence becomes the new standard, ensuring that animals are treated with the respect they deserve.
53;Modern technology has made it possible for people to view exhibitions at home so museums and art galleries will disappear soon. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology; therefore, some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon. Although modern technology make it possible, I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear.On the one hand, technology indeed simplifies people's life all the time. Obviously, people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home, save the time and money on the road, which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society. However, in accordance with recent research, experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication.On the other hand, the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture. First of all, authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos. It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos, so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it. Furthermore, museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages; therefore, these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture.In conclusion, I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions, but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture.";In recent years, the rapid advancement of technology has led some to speculate that museums and art galleries might soon become obsolete. The rise of virtual reality experiences, online galleries, and streaming exhibitions suggests a shift towards digital alternatives that may reduce the need for physical institutions. However, the importance of museums and art galleries in education and culture remains irrefutable, showcasing that these traditional spaces are far from disappearing.One of the primary roles of museums and art galleries is their capacity to educate. They offer a tangible way for individuals, particularly students, to engage with history, art, and science. Authentic exhibits provide context and depth that images and videos simply cannot replicate. Standing before a Van Gogh painting or a dinosaur skeleton creates an emotional and cognitive connection that digital representations lack. The sensory experiences involved in being in the presence of these artifacts—seeing their textures, understanding their scale, and feeling the atmosphere of the space—are integral to the learning process.Additionally, museums serve as cultural hubs, where diverse communities come together to celebrate their heritage and share their stories. They facilitate dialogue, encourage curiosity, and foster a sense of belonging. This cultural significance cannot be replaced by modern technology. While it is true that digital platforms widen access and offer broader participation, they cannot capture the communal experience of visiting a museum or art gallery, the conversations sparked by shared experiences, or the inspiration drawn from engaging with authentic works of art.In conclusion, despite the emerging influence of technology, museums and art galleries are crucial pillars of education and culture that foster a deep connection to our past and present. Rather than disappearing, these institutions must adapt by integrating modern tools while preserving the richness of the real-life experiences they offer.
54;Some people believe that teenagers should learn all school subjects, while others claim that students should focus on the subjects that they are best at or that they are interested in. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Presently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected. Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study. Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.It is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future. Therefore, I do support the view of learning all school subjects.;The debate surrounding the educational curriculum has become increasingly prominent, with public opinion divided between advocates for a well-rounded education encompassing multiple subjects and those who propose a concentrated focus on a single discipline. This contention raises pertinent questions about the efficacy of education and the best means of preparing students for their futures.Proponents of a comprehensive education argue that exposure to a wide range of subjects is essential for developing critical thinking, creativity, and adaptability. Supporters assert that subjects such as science, math, literature, and the arts collectively foster a holistic understanding of the world, equipping students with diverse skill sets. For many parents, a full class schedule is a source of satisfaction, as it enables their children to explore various interests, discover hidden talents, and develop well-rounded personalities. This multifaceted approach can cultivate a more versatile workforce capable of thriving in an ever-evolving economy.Conversely, some parents and educators advocate for an education system that emphasizes depth over breadth. They argue that an in-depth focus on a single subject allows students to cultivate expertise and master complex concepts, potentially leading to enhanced performance and retention. This model is viewed as particularly effective in an age where specialization is increasingly valued in the job market. By honing their skills in a specific area, students may find more opportunities in competitive fields such as technology, engineering, or the arts.Ultimately, the question of whether to teach all subjects or focus narrowly on one depends on various factors including individual student needs, career aspirations, and pedagogical philosophies. Striking a balance between breadth and depth may be key, allowing students to benefit from the advantages of both approaches. As education continues to evolve, it is crucial for stakeholders to engage in discussions that consider the future landscape of work and learning.
55;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;In the present age, it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English. Some people claim it's a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits. Personally, I agree with the former opinion.No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally. To begin with, communication between countries and cultures become convenient. In my country, English is a required course from elementary school. Thus, studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters. For them, language obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country. This, in turn, enhances relationship and promotes international business. Furthermore, researchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English. Taking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English. It's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides. As a result, they have no choice but choosing English as a second language.Admittedly, opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year. Hence, the culture heritage and nation identity vanish. However, this is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society.In conclusion, in spite of some negative effects, I'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around. I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization. But at the same time, actions, like recording, can be taken to protect native languages and cultures.;The prevalence of the English language in today’s global society is a topic that elicits varied opinions. While it is true that this linguistic dominance may have certain negative effects, I firmly believe that the widespread use of English brings numerous benefits to individuals and countries alike.In my country, the incorporation of English as a mandatory subject in elementary school serves as a foundational pillar for future opportunities. This early introduction equips students with essential language skills, fostering an environment where studying abroad is not only feasible but also highly popular among the youth. Youngsters are increasingly seeking international experiences to enhance their education and personal growth, and proficiency in English significantly eases this transition. Being able to communicate effectively in English opens doors to diverse cultures and academic systems, thereby enriching their perspectives and career prospects.Moreover, for researchers, particularly those engaged in high-tech and scientific fields, a strong command of English allows for broader access to valuable resources. Most leading research papers, journals, and conferences today are conducted in English. Consequently, researchers proficient in English can tap into a wider range of literature and collaborate with international peers. This exchange of ideas fosters innovation and accelerates advancements in technology and science, benefiting society as a whole.In conclusion, despite some concerns regarding the dominance of English, the advantages it brings, particularly in education and research, are significant. The integration of English in our educational system not only facilitates opportunities for young students to study abroad but also empowers researchers to make meaningful contributions to their fields. Thus, promoting the English language is indeed a step forward for individuals and nations, ultimately leading to a more interconnected and progressive world.
56;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, pictures, music or film) in whichever way they wish. there should be no government restrictions on what they do. to what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious. Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds. Creativity originates in a free mind. Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions.Time and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message. Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras. Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message.Nonetheless, innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience. It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments. For instance, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue. This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds. In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.Unfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, ""Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open“. Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains. Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely.However, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people. Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose. I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression. Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries. Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws.";Creativity is often described as a boundless exploration of ideas and emotions, originating from a free mind unencumbered by restrictions. When artists are afforded the liberty to express themselves, they can delve deep into the vast terrain of human experience, bringing forth innovative works that resonate profoundly with society. The essence of creativity lies in its ability to challenge norms, provoke thought, and inspire change, making it crucial for artists to operate without the fetters of censorship or fear of backlash.However, while freedom of expression is vital for fostering creativity, it must be balanced with a sense of responsibility. Artists, like members of the media, wield significant power in shaping public discourse and influencing cultural narratives. With this power comes the responsibility to be mindful of the sentiments of others. This doesn’t mean that artists must censor themselves, but rather that they should be conscious of the impact their work can have on diverse audiences. It is possible to push boundaries and provoke thought without demeaning or dehumanizing those whom one seeks to engage with.In a world increasingly polarized by varying views and beliefs, artists should strive to engage in a respectful dialogue through their creative works. They can encourage an open exchange of ideas that reflects the complexity of the human experience. By doing so, they create art that not only challenges perceptions but also fosters understanding and connection among disparate groups.In conclusion, the interplay of freedom and responsibility in art is essential for nurturing a vibrant creative landscape. An artist’s ability to explore and express their ideas freely should coexist with a deep awareness of the potential consequences, ensuring that creativity flourishes while honoring the diverse tapestry of human feelings and perspectives.
57;some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;The modern society is full of cut-throat competition. Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed. However, co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle.Co-operation is essential for teamwork. Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children. We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success. A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself. For instance, lions hunt in a team. It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy. In the same way, co-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate.Nevertheless, co-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes. It helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others. A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements. However, competition is also as important as co-operation.Unfortunately, the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction. An individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others. Competition has helped the development of science and technology. Competition helps in improvement and evolution. For example, every other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others. This kind of competition gives customers more options.However, blind and selfish competition is detrimental. 'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run. Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule. A healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach.Thus, competition and co-operation go hand in hand. These are two sides of the same coin which can't be separated. I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition. They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition. When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together, success, achievements, recognition and any goal becomes easier.;"Co-operation and competition are two fundamental elements of human interaction that, while often viewed as opposites, are intricately intertwined – two sides of the same coin. Each contributes uniquely to advancement and success in various spheres, including economics, social relationships, and particularly in the domains of science and technology.At first glance, competition may seem like a driving force that inspires individuals and organizations to excel. Historical advancements echo this notion; for instance, the Space Race spurred unprecedented progress in aeronautics and technology, as nations vied for supremacy in space exploration. Such rivalry accelerates innovation, compelling scientists and engineers to push boundaries and achieve breakthroughs. Without competition, the momentum for improvement may stagnate, leading to complacency rather than advancement.However, the true power of human endeavor lies in the balance between co-operation and competition. A 'your loss, my gain' mentality can ultimately stifle progress. When rivalry breeds animosity, it creates an environment where collaboration suffers, harming all parties involved. In science and technology, many breakthroughs arise not from solitary efforts but from collaborative endeavors among diverse groups working toward a common goal. The Human Genome Project, for example, illustrates how shared knowledge and resources among international scientists vastly accelerated genetic research, yielding benefits for humanity.Effective competition should inspire co-operation, wherein the parties recognize that shared success is attainable. Rather than viewing each other solely as rivals, innovators can learn from one another, exchange ideas, and build upon each other's work, creating a virtuous cycle of enhancement and discovery. Ultimately, competition can serve as a catalyst for progress, but when it undermines collaboration, it can become counterproductive.In conclusion, for sustainable growth in science and technology, we must embrace the symbiotic relationship between co-operation and competition, acknowledging that both are essential to achieving enduring success. Only by fostering an environment where these forces coexist harmoniously can we truly harness human potential for collective advancement."
58;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violent increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Crime is always punishable. Retribution is the method for countering criminals. Some countries have stringent rules, like capital punishment, while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system. However, strict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society.Capital punishment is given only in the ""rarest of the rare"" cases. Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings. When a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment. Thus, capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals.Moreover, capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes. When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes. Thus, the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased.Importantly, capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals. Criminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment.However, the jury giving the verdict are also humans. They have the life of a person at their discretion. They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. For example, if an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous. Only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment.Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society. I firmly believe that psychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment. Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner. However, it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict.";"Crime disrupts societal harmony and poses a significant challenge for communities worldwide. To maintain order, laws are implemented to deter individuals from engaging in criminal activities. A fundamental principle within criminal justice is that crime is always punishable. The certainty of punishment serves not only as a means of retribution but also as a critical mechanism for preventing future offenses. Retribution is a concept deeply rooted in justice, positing that individuals who commit crimes should face consequences proportional to the severity of their actions. This form of justice underscores the belief that punishment is justified and necessary for societal balance. In the case of heinous crimes, especially those that threaten the fabric of society, capital punishment may be considered, albeit in the ""rarest of the rare"" situations. This stringent criterion aims to ensure that the most extreme measure is reserved for truly egregious offenses, reflecting the gravity of the crime while upholding the sanctity of life.When individuals comprehend the quantum of punishment associated with their actions, it instills a healthy fear of the law. This awareness acts as a significant deterrent, discouraging potential criminals from engaging in unlawful activities. An informed society, where the repercussions of crime are well publicized and understood, fosters a safer environment. The psychology behind deterrence indicates that the certainty of punishment can be more influential than the severity of the punishment itself. In conclusion, while crime is an inevitable aspect of human society, the frameworks of retribution and punishment are essential to maintaining order. Capital punishment, reserved for the most heinous offenses, exemplifies the legal system's commitment to justice. By ensuring accountability, society can inhibit criminal behavior, promoting a more secure and just environment for all."
59;In some countries, young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Studies are an essential part of life. Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies, while in some countries, it is considered as waste of time. However, a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school.In most education systems, a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age. A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change. A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions. Personally, a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by traveling or following their hobbies. Importantly, when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge.Nevertheless, during high school, many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in. Working or traveling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest. It will also help them to learn professional setup by working. Financially, students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job. Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course.However, there are also disadvantages. A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental. When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia. For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably. Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time. But, the break should be an optional thing. It varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period. A break gives students more benefits than harms.Importantly, the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them. Thus, a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies. Countries, like India, where such a break is considered a blot, should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition. One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life.;The educational journey for most students typically begins at the age of five and continues uninterrupted until around 16 years of age. This continuous academic trajectory aims to equip young minds with essential knowledge and skills. However, the debate about whether to allow students to take a break between high school and university studies has gained traction, polarizing opinions across different countries. In some nations, taking a gap year is viewed as a valuable opportunity for personal development, while in others, it is seen as a waste of time that detracts from educational momentum.Supporters of taking a break argue that a year off can provide a quintessential change for students who have been in a structured academic environment for over a decade. This period can be transformative, as young individuals engage in work or travel, allowing them to gain real-world experience and maturity. These experiences often help students discover their field of interest, providing clarity about their future educational and career choices. By immersing themselves in different cultures or working in diverse environments, students can develop a broader perspective, enhancing their personal growth and fostering independence.Conversely, opponents of gap years argue that stepping away from studies can disrupt the educational journey and lead to a loss of academic momentum. They believe that continuous learning is crucial for intellectual development, and any hiatus can diminish motivation or alter a student's trajectory. Critics also express concern that a break may result in students deviating from their educational goals, potentially leading to a longer path toward completing their degrees.Ultimately, whether a gap year is beneficial or detrimental depends on the individual. Each student has unique needs, aspirations, and circumstances. Thus, a balanced approach that incorporates the potential advantages of taking a break while maintaining academic continuity could be the most effective strategy for nurturing well-rounded, future-ready individuals.
60;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;"Computer-a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life. Ever since Charles Babbage (know as ""Father of computers"") invented computers, its development never had a pause. The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years.In the modern world, computers are used everywhere. Right from flying planes to sending a small document, computers are needed. They are used in space programs, wars, hospitals, schools and so on. Computers have made human life more easy, convenient and lightning fast. For example, in earlier days, if one had to send a message to someone in other country, it used to take months. But today, it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks. Computers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it.Moreover, future prospects of computers are very bright. From a computer as big as a room, it has now been minimized to the size of a palm. Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels. Research on making computerized drone soldiers (unmanned computer controlled) is going on. There is no end to the evolution of computers.However, everything has pros and cons. Computers have made humans over-dependent. Virus programs, privacy breach, leak of confidential documents, cyber attacks, identity theft, frauds etc. are some of its demerits, from a countless list. Computers expose children to vulgar materials. They have even invaded mental health of humans, for example, FAD (Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook). Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives. The recent case of Wikileaks, leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful.Nevertheless, with all the mentioned demerits, computers have provided security and sophistication too. Thus, dependence on computers is not a bad thing. However, one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things. Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective. Human life today can't be imagined without computers, so not depending on them is out of question.";"The advent of computers has undeniably transformed human life, ushering in an era marked by unprecedented convenience, efficiency, and connectivity. As a revolutionary device, the computer has added a whole new dimension to society, affecting every sector from education to healthcare, and revolutionizing how we communicate, work, and access information. Today, it is difficult to imagine a world where computers do not play a pivotal role; their absence would thrust humanity back into a more primitive state, reminiscent of centuries past.Computers have streamlined numerous tasks, enhancing productivity and enabling individuals to perform complex calculations, access vast repositories of information, and connect with others instantaneously. The convenience offered by modern computing allows for remote work, online education, and telehealth, fostering greater flexibility in daily routines. Moreover, the internet, powered by computer technology, has bridged geographical gaps, turning the world into a global village.However, this technological marvel is not without its drawbacks. The over-reliance on computers has led to concerns about decreased face-to-face interactions and social skills, particularly among younger generations. An increase in screen time can also contribute to health issues, such as poor eyesight and sedentary lifestyles. Additionally, with the rise of cyber threats and the potential for data breaches, our dependence on technology raises significant concerns about privacy and security.In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly revolutionized human existence by making life easier, more convenient, and vastly quicker, it is essential to recognize both the advantages and the pitfalls of this dependence. As society continues to forge ahead into a more technologically advanced future, it becomes crucial to strike a balance that harnesses the benefits of computers while mitigating their potential risks. Embracing both the possibilities and the challenges of this digital age is vital for fostering a sustainable and enriching future for humanity."
61;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Education is important for the development of the world. Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not. However, since both genders are equally important, both must be given equal opportunities. Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices.Right to education is a basic human right of both, males and females. The whole world aims for women empowerment, and to achieve this, females should be given equal opportunities as males. When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop.Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other. It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together. For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them. On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys. Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both. Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run.Unfortunately, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc. This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society. Time and again, women have proved their mettle in every field. Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills.Thus, I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers. Equality in education will help in development of the society. Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior. Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit, irrespective of the gender. Educational rights must be given to both genders.;Co-education, the practice of educating male and female students together in the same environment, plays a crucial role in fostering mutual respect and understanding between the genders. This method of schooling not only helps dismantle stereotypes but also prepares students for real-world interactions. By sharing classrooms and participating in collaborative projects, students learn to appreciate each other’s strengths and weaknesses, which are often influenced by individual abilities rather than gender.Unfortunately, male chauvinism continues to perpetuate harmful stereotypes, particularly regarding women’s capabilities in fields traditionally dominated by men, such as mathematics, mechanical engineering, and defense. Critics often erroneously argue that women lack the aptitude for these subjects, fostering a belief that they are inherently less capable. This kind of rigid, gender-biased perspective is not only unfounded but also detrimental to societal development as a whole. It limits opportunities for half the population and discourages talented individuals from pursuing their interests or careers in these vital fields.Promoting co-education can significantly counter this issue. Exposure to diverse viewpoints and talents equips both genders with a broader understanding of capabilities beyond traditional associations. In co-educational settings, male and female students can collaborate, compete, and motivate one another, effectively dispelling myths about gender-based limitations. The shared experiences can pave the way for women to excel in areas where they have been historically underrepresented, while also allowing men to appreciate and recognize the contributions that women can make in every field.Ultimately, abandoning outdated notions of gender roles benefits not only individuals but society at large. Encouraging equal participation and collaboration among genders helps build a more inclusive environment that leads to innovation, economic growth, and progress. Co-education thus serves as a fundamental mechanism for ensuring that society moves forward, united in the belief that talent knows no gender.
63;Traditional games are more useful than modern games in developing children's skills. To what extent do you agree?;Games have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities. With technological advances, children have more access to modern games currently. In such case, the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children's developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion. For me, I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.It is true that modern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend. This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future. At the same time, children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative.However, I think traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society. One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills. Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face. As a result, communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more.Furthermore, it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today. In fact, these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices. By contrast, modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits. Therefore, there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival.Thus, I would conclude that traditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games. Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process.;Games have always been an integral part of children's growth and development, serving as essential tools for enhancing various abilities. In considering the role of games in child development, I believe that parents and educators should place a greater emphasis on traditional games. These time-honored activities not only offer entertainment but also significantly benefit children's social, cognitive, and physical skills.One primary merit of traditional games is their ability to foster communication skills. Often played in groups, traditional games require participants to interact, negotiate, and work together to achieve a common goal. Whether it's playing tag, participating in a game of hopscotch, or engaging in team sports like soccer or basketball, children learn to express themselves, listen to others, and navigate social dynamics. These skills are crucial for their overall development and prepare them for real-world interactions.In contrast, many modern games developed by game companies often prioritize profit over educational value. While video games can provide enjoyable experiences, they frequently promote individual play and can lead to reduced face-to-face communication among peers. This trend can hinder the growth of essential interpersonal skills, as children may become more skilled at navigating virtual interactions rather than real-life relationships. Furthermore, many modern games may encourage sedentary behavior, which also detracts from physical development.By prioritizing traditional games, parents and educators can help create an environment where children thrive socially and emotionally. These games serve not just as entertainment but as essential learning experiences, promoting teamwork, understanding, and personal growth. In an age where digital screens dominate children’s playtime, a return to traditional games can provide a refreshing balance, enriching children's lives in ways that modern gaming often overlooks. Ultimately, embracing traditional games offers a unique opportunity to nurture well-rounded individuals prepared for the multifaceted challenges of life.
64;Some people said the government shouldn't put money on building theaters or sports stadiums but should spend more money on medical care and education. Do you agree or disagree?;How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public. Recently, some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities. As far as I am concerned, this proposal is beneficial more to the society.Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums. As a matter of fact, an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games. Therefore, providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government.Entertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented. Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience. The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government. Instead, the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government.Furthermore, putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them. For example, not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot. Therefore, it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs. That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.To summarize, I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, because the former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens.;The allocation of government funding has long been a source of intense debate, especially regarding whether resources should be directed more towards medical care and education instead of entertainment and sports facilities. Many argue that the fundamental responsibilities of government lie in ensuring the well-being of its citizens, making healthcare and education paramount.Investing in medical care is essential as it directly affects public health and safety. Inadequate funding can lead to substandard healthcare services, resulting in increased mortality rates, further burdening emergency rooms, and straining healthcare professionals. A well-funded healthcare system not only provides immediate care but also emphasizes preventative measures, which can save taxpayers money in the long run. When citizens have access to quality healthcare, it contributes to a healthier workforce and, subsequently, a more robust economy.Education is equally vital. A well-educated populace is crucial for societal progress and economic development. By prioritizing education funding, governments can ensure that all citizens, regardless of their economic background, have the opportunity to succeed and contribute to society. High-quality education fosters critical thinking, innovation, and informed citizenship. Investing in education yields long-term benefits that can elevate entire communities, reducing poverty and enhancing social mobility.In contrast, expenditures on entertainment and sports facilities often cater to a narrow audience, potentially alienating those who do not engage with these activities. Using taxpayer money to build theaters and stadiums raises ethical questions about equity. It may be perceived as unjust to fund such initiatives when fundamental needs such as health and education remain under-resourced. In conclusion, the government’s focus should prioritize medical care and education over entertainment and sports facilities. By doing so, it demonstrates a commitment to the well-being and development of all citizens, fostering a healthier, more educated, and ultimately more equitable society.
65;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It's pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Living in the 21st century, people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity. Thus, every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years, regardless of any potential problems it may bring about. Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles. However, I believe their concern is groundless. Instead, technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles.In terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life. In the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles. This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills. However, with the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere.Additionally, technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing. For example, China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens. In fact, many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture.On the other hand, some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles. They argue that people, especially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques. But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years.Therefore, I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles. Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run.;The advancement of modern technology has sparked a considerable debate regarding its impact on traditional techniques and lifestyles. While some critics argue that technology acts as a barrier, diluting rich cultural practices and causing societal shifts that undermine traditional ways of life, it is essential to recognize that technology can also serve as a powerful catalyst for the preservation and promotion of these traditions.First and foremost, technology enhances the efficiency with which traditional skills can be disseminated and practiced. Digital platforms enable artisans and craftsmen to share their techniques with a global audience through online tutorials, webinars, and social media. These resources not only allow for the preservation of ancient skills but also invite younger generations to engage with their cultural heritage. For instance, social media campaigns focused on traditional crafts often bring newfound interest and appreciation from users who might be geographically distant from the practices themselves.Furthermore, technology bridges the gap of time and space, making it possible to learn and experience traditional practices without the constraints of physical locality. Virtual workshops or recorded demonstrations allow individuals worldwide to partake in community rituals or master important craftsmanship techniques, which might otherwise be at risk of being forgotten. The accessibility that technology provides aids in fostering wider recognition and respect for cultural identities, encouraging an environment where tradition can coexist with modernity.In conclusion, while concerns regarding the erosion of traditional lifestyles due to modern technological advancements are valid, we must also acknowledge the significant benefits that technology brings in preserving these traditions. By facilitating their accessibility, promoting engagement, and fostering understanding, technology is not merely a hurdle but a vital tool in the revival and celebration of traditional skills and ways of life. Embracing this synergy between tradition and technology is crucial for ensuring that cultural heritage thrives in the contemporary world.
66;Creative artists should be given freedom to express their ideas (words, pictures, music and films. However some people think government should take some restriction with them. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life; however, some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government. It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society; however, I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work. It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning. If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth? In a word, the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified.Let's then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals. It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc. I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.By way of conclusion, I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work; on the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful.";"The role of art and artists in society has always been a subject of intense debate. Some critics argue that artists wield too much freedom and power, suggesting that government restrictions are necessary to prevent potential societal misinformation and maintain social stability. However, I firmly believe that the freedom to express thoughts and ideas should be celebrated rather than curtailed.Art, in its myriad forms, serves as a reflection of society. It has the power to illuminate uncomfortable truths, provoke thought, and inspire change. Restricting artists stifles creativity, diminishing the value of art as a vehicle for expression. The fear that artists might disseminate misleading information and destabilize society is not without merit; however, this concern underestimates the discerning capabilities of the audience. Art encourages critical thinking and invites dialogue, driving audiences to engage actively with the content presented to them. By imposing restrictions, we risk fostering an environment of censorship that ultimately hampers innovation and the progression of ideas.Moreover, restriction can lead to a paradoxical effect where artists may feel compelled to push boundaries further, testing limits and challenging norms, thereby drawing more attention to controversial issues. Artists like Banksy and Ai Weiwei have shown us that art can become a powerful form of protest against oppressive systems, often highlighting absurdities or injustices that might otherwise be ignored. Limiting an artist's freedom can lead to a culture of fear, where they shy away from addressing pressing social issues out of anxiety for governmental repercussions.In conclusion, while concerns regarding social misinformation stemming from art are valid, they should not overshadow the immense value that artistic freedom brings to society. Encouraging diverse expressions will lead to healthier discourse and a more vibrant cultural landscape. Therefore, rather than imposing restrictions, we should support artists in their pursuit of truth and encourage open dialogue around their creations."
67;The government should control the amount of violence in the media to reduce the number of violent crimes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media.Obviously, violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences. This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who, lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong, are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable.On the other hand, media, such as TV or film, is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government. It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society. Violence, as one of the facts in the real world, certainly has to be reported. However, excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well. It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members, one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy. In the real world, we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure.We cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present. What the government should do immediately is to strengthen censorship to control the amount of violence in media. Otherwise, the violent crime rate will rise continuously and out of control someday.;The portrayal of violence in the media has become an increasingly pervasive phenomenon, often depicted in an extreme manner to attract larger audiences. This trend is particularly evident in films, television shows, and online content where violent scenes are stylized and sensationalized, with the intent of evoking strong emotional reactions. While violence is undeniably a part of the human experience and thus merits reporting, an excessive focus on graphic depictions can lead to significant misrepresentation and misunderstanding of real-world issues.The media has a responsibility to inform the public about violence, whether it is related to crime, conflict, or social issues. However, when outlets choose to emphasize the most extreme forms of violence, they inadvertently skew public perception. Audiences may come to believe that violence is more prevalent than it truly is, potentially leading to heightened fear, desensitization, and normalization of violent behavior. This misrepresentation can have profound implications, influencing societal attitudes toward crime and justice, promoting stereotypes, and shaping public policy based on fear rather than balanced understanding.Moreover, the overemphasis on violence in media can exert a detrimental influence on society, particularly among younger viewers. Children and adolescents, who are still developing their understanding of morality and reality, are at risk of internalizing the belief that violence is an acceptable way to resolve conflict. This harmful influence can contribute to aggression and antisocial behaviors, perpetuating a cycle of violence that extends beyond the screen.In conclusion, while the representation of violence in the media serves a role in revealing societal issues, the excessive and sensationalized portrayal is misleading and harmful. It is crucial for media creators to adopt a more responsible approach, prioritizing accuracy over shock value. By doing so, they can contribute to a more informed public and a healthier society.
68;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think this situation has caused more problems than it has solved. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons or your answer;"The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life, including the revolution of feminism. Women have been opened up to more chances than ever. This, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society from my point of view.To start with, the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society. Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children. Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on. This is to say, the ""weaker"" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields.In the second place, the revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well. The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money. What is more, women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration.Admittedly, such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or, under many circumstances, women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives. Also, children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work. Yet everything has it upside and downside, women should find the best way to overcome such challenges.All things considered, in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles.";"In modern times, the landscape of society has undergone significant transformation across numerous dimensions, with the feminist revolution emerging as one of the most pivotal movements. This evolution seeks to address longstanding grievances centering around gender inequality and women's rights. Contrary to certain perspectives that claim feminism disrupts societal harmony, I view this advancement as a positive progression that benefits not only women but society as a whole.At its core, feminism advocates for equal rights and opportunities, challenging the traditional roles that have limited women's participation in various spheres, from the workplace to politics. When society embraces the principles of feminism and facilitates equal opportunities for all genders, it fosters an environment where diverse talents and perspectives can thrive. This inclusivity leads to innovative solutions and improved decision-making processes critical for societal progress. For example, research consistently shows that companies with diverse leadership teams outperform their peers, proving that gender equality can enhance organizational performance.Moreover, societies that prioritize gender equality tend to experience broader socio-economic benefits. Communities with empowered women experience higher levels of education and health among future generations, resulting in reduced poverty rates and improved quality of life. When women are empowered to make choices about their careers, education, and family planning, they contribute more substantially to economic growth and stability.While the journey toward achieving true equality continues to encounter obstacles—such as cultural resistance and systemic biases—the tangible benefits of a society committed to feminism are undeniable. The progress made thus far demonstrates that equality does not merely uplift women; it enriches the entire community. Ultimately, a society that champions equal opportunities for all, regardless of gender, sets the foundation for a more just, innovative, and prosperous future."
69;Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree? What other measures do you think might be effective?;"As we read newspapers or watch TV, we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues, air and water pollution questions. Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems. As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching, it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems, though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society.Specifically, price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area; however, whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated. On one hand, governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands. Consequently, it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly. On the other hand, pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution. In addition, the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours.As illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems. Primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars. Furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season. Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems. Meanwhile, cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice.In conclusion, addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate, while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable, plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised.";"Price control institutions have historically been employed in various sectors, notably in agriculture and real estate, as a mechanism to stabilize markets and ensure affordability. By implementing price ceilings or floors, governments can mitigate the volatility of essential goods and services, protecting consumers from price gouging while also safeguarding the interests of producers. However, the effectiveness of such controls in addressing multifaceted issues like traffic congestion and pollution warrants critical assessment.On one hand, it can be argued that price controls might offer a solution to alleviate the financial burdens associated with transportation costs, thereby potentially reducing the number of vehicles on the road. For instance, subsidizing public transportation fares or implementing price caps on fuel could encourage people to adopt more sustainable travel alternatives. However, traffic and pollution stem from complex sources that transcend mere economic factors.While price controls might address certain economic aspects of transportation, they do not address the root causes of pollution, which include not only vehicular emissions from fossil fuel consumption but also contributions from industrial activities, chemical pollutants, and aberrant urban planning. The burning of oil is just one dimension of a broader pollution crisis; industrial emissions, construction debris, and excessive lighting all contribute significantly to environmental degradation. Therefore, implementing price controls without a comprehensive approach is unlikely to yield meaningful improvements in urban air quality or traffic flow. Addressing pollution and congestion necessitates innovative solutions, such as promoting alternative energy, investing in infrastructure for public transport, enforcing stricter pollution standards, and encouraging urban development that prioritizes green spaces. In conclusion, while price control institutions can serve as tools within a larger strategy, they must be integrated with multifaceted policies that tackle the diverse sources of traffic and pollution to create sustainable urban environments."
70;Should advertisements be banned? To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information. Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public. My view is that while some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring.First, it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring. In fact, they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor.Besides, it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies. In a larger sense, it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country. A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic.That is not to say, however, that advertisements have no downsides. Of course, the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies. Yet, its merits still outweigh these downsides.Taken all together, advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth. We can not deny all of them. However, if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned, advertisements would be welcomed by more.;Public service advertisements (PSAs) play a vital role in society that extends beyond mere commercial interests. Unlike traditional advertisements, which primarily aim to promote products or boost sales, PSAs focus on disseminating cultural values, fostering good moral traits, and advocating for societal issues like support for the disabled and the impoverished. This altruistic approach underscores the mission of PSAs: to inform, educate, and inspire positive change within communities.At their core, PSAs are designed to address critical social issues, such as health awareness, environmental conservation, and the importance of community support for marginalized groups. By educating the public on these matters, PSAs serve to elevate societal norms and values. They often highlight the importance of empathy and kindness, urging individuals to take action—whether by volunteering, donating, or simply showing compassion toward those in need. This type of messaging is crucial in creating a more just and caring society.On the other hand, commercial advertisements focus on maximizing profits and often leverage brand image to enhance sales. The promotion of products through mass media can effectively capture the attention of potential consumers, thereby driving up sales and supporting corporate success. Companies frequently invest substantial resources in marketing their products to create a recognizable brand identity that resonates with consumers. While both PSAs and commercial advertisements occupy the same media space, their purposes diverge significantly. PSAs aim to forge a collective cultural consciousness that prioritizes human decency and community support, while commercial advertisements are centered around economic outcomes. Both forms of advertisement contribute to societal dynamics, yet they embody distinct philosophies that reflect the balance between profit-making and social responsibility. Ultimately, while profit is a critical motivator in business, the intrinsic value of PSAs lies in their commitment to cultivating a compassionate and ethical society.
71;People have different ways of escaping the stress and difficulties of modern life. Some read, some exercise, others work in their gardens. What do you think are the best ways of reducing stress? Use specific details and examples to support your opinion.;In modern society, people often face many difficulties under great stress. Therefore, it is necessary for many to find ways to relax. Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies, such as reading, watching movies, or working in their gardens, I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise, which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions.It is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health. Any kinds of sports, such as jogging, swimming, or playing basketball, can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system. Moreover, these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body. The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity. Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years, which mainly results from insufficient exercises.Sports activities can improve mental health as well. When people exercise, the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine. This hormone can delight one's mind, creating positive feelings. Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one's heavy burdens. Moreover, rigorous exercise can also hone one's will, which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks.In a nutshell, many activities can let humans relax. Nevertheless, I assert that the best way of diminishing stress is by exercises, which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally.;"In modern society, the prevalence of stress has become an almost ubiquitous challenge, affecting individuals across various demographics. The pressures of work, relationships, and societal expectations can lead to a state of constant unease and anxiety. In my view, one of the most effective methods of alleviating stress is through engaging in different kinds of exercise. Not only does exercise benefit physical health, but it also fosters positive emotional wellbeing, making it a holistic approach to managing stress.Exercise, in its many forms, offers a myriad of health benefits. Regular physical activity can improve cardiovascular health, enhance stamina, and increase overall energy levels. This physiological boost not only helps individuals perform daily tasks with greater ease but also establishes a stronger foundation for mental resilience. When the body is strong and healthy, the mind often follows suit, leading to a reduction in stress levels.Moreover, exercise acts as a natural stress reliever. Activities such as jogging, yoga, or even dancing can elevate mood by releasing endorphins, often referred to as ""feel-good"" hormones. These endorphins interact with the receptors in our brain to reduce the perception of pain, which can lead to feelings of happiness and euphoria. Furthermore, engaging in physical activities can serve as a form of meditation in motion, allowing individuals to focus on their bodies and the present moment, thus temporarily pushing away lingering stressors.Importantly, exercise can also foster social connections. Group classes, team sports, or even a brisk walk with friends create opportunities for social interaction, adding a layer of support and camaraderie that is crucial in times of stress. In conclusion, embracing various forms of exercise is a powerful method for modern individuals to manage stress effectively, leading to improved health and greater emotional resilience."
72;In the modern world, the image (photograph or film) is becoming a more powerful way of communication than the written word. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""A picture is worth a thousand words"" is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time. This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, or opinions to people. Nevertheless, the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used. Hence, I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication.Firstly, pictures can influence the way people think. For example, nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking. As a result, statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit. Not only that, the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan. Apart from that, images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements. Thus, it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many.Looking from another perspective, written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages. With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images. Nonetheless, this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about. Furthermore, the primary way of educating students is also by this way. Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better.To conclude, both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words. Hence, for a more meaningful communication, these two elements have their respective roles to play: image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject.";"The adage ""A picture is worth a thousand words"" highlights the profound impact images can have in conveying messages and emotions swiftly and effectively. Indeed, in today’s fast-paced digital world, images often serve as immediate and powerful communicators, capable of transcending language barriers and cultural differences. Social media platforms, for instance, thrive on visual content, with images often capturing moments that words may struggle to encapsulate. A photograph can evoke emotions, create shifts in perception, and drive social movements more rapidly than lengthy written accounts can. However, while I agree that images hold significant communicative power, I believe it's essential to recognize the profound importance of the written word. Written communication offers a depth and nuance that images often cannot convey. The intricacies of language allow for the exploration of complex ideas and emotions in ways that images may fail to articulate. For example, a poem or a carefully crafted essay provides insights into a person's thoughts that a picture alone simply cannot capture. Textual narratives can delve into the underlying motivations and contexts that images might obscure. Moreover, the written word is foundational in the documentation of history, culture, and legislation. Legal documents, literature, and scholarly articles are pivotal in shaping societies and informing future generations. Without text, the rich tapestry of human knowledge would unravel, leaving future societies without access to the wealth of our experiences and insights.In conclusion, while images undoubtedly serve as an effective means of communication in our visually oriented era, the written word remains irreplaceable. Each method has its unique strengths, working in tandem to enhance our understanding of the world. Ultimately, it is a balance between the two that enriches human communication and expression."
73;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world. Some people, therefore, harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them. But the others do not believe it is possible. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue.First and foremost, it is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country. It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country. The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist. Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting. What is more, it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more.On the other hand, there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages. Although governments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results. As evidence of this, there are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those. These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular. In addition, the preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre. If they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money.In a nutshell, I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible. All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those.;The preservation of minority languages has sparked a debate about the responsibilities of governments in maintaining cultural diversity. Some people believe that significant resources should be allocated to support these languages, thereby ensuring their survival alongside dominant tongues. However, this viewpoint merits thorough examination, especially considering the potential drawbacks of such endeavors.On one hand, the financial implications of preserving minority languages could strain state budgets, especially in countries already facing economic challenges. Governments might be compelled to divert funds from crucial services such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure development to support language programs. This could lead to dissatisfaction among the general population, particularly if they feel their needs are not being met. Moreover, the potential for inefficiency in how these funds are managed could result in wasted resources without achieving the intended outcomes, such as revitalizing a language or promoting its everyday use.Additionally, the promotion of minority languages might inadvertently foster societal divisions. While advocating for language preservation is rooted in the enhancement of cultural identity, it can also create an “us versus them” mentality, leading to friction among different linguistic communities. Such divisions could undermine social cohesion and promote cultural isolationism, which is contrary to the broader aims of inclusivity and unity within diverse societies.Furthermore, practical concerns about the viability of minority languages should not be overlooked. Many languages have few speakers, making daily usage and intergenerational transmission difficult. As global communication increasingly leans towards dominant languages, particularly in professional and academic contexts, the practicality of investing in the maintenance of languages with limited utility must be questioned.In conclusion, while preserving minority languages is undeniably important for cultural heritage, the potential drawbacks—ranging from economic implications to social fragmentation—should be critically assessed. Governments must find a balance between promoting linguistic diversity and addressing the broader needs of their populations.
74;Many people think arts and music do not improve the quality of life, and the government should spent money on other things rather than the arts such as music and painting, to what extent agree or disagree_;My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs.Art is not the key determination of quality of life, but education is. In order to make people better off, it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens. This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people's lives for a well-rounded social system.Admittedly, art, to some extent, serve a valuable function about enriching one's daily lives, for example, it could bring release one's heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work. However, it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries, in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room. By comparison to these issues, the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all.To conclude, art could play an active role in improving the quality of people's lives, but I think that governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs because those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life.;In contemporary society, the role of government funding is paramount in enhancing the quality of life for its citizens. One of the most pressing arguments is that the government should prioritize investments in basic social welfare programs such as education and housing, rather than allocating substantial resources to the arts. While the arts undoubtedly enrich our culture, they do not serve as the foundation for a thriving society. Instead, it is education that equips individuals with the knowledge and wisdom necessary for personal and community development.Education is the cornerstone of social mobility and economic opportunity. A well-educated population fosters innovation, drives economic growth, and ultimately enhances the standard of living for everyone. Investment in education not only produces a more skilled workforce but also encourages critical thinking and civic engagement. Citizens with access to quality education are better equipped to make informed decisions, participate in democratic processes, and contribute positively to society. This creates a well-rounded social system conducive to progress.Moreover, housing is an integral part of social welfare that directly influences people's quality of life. Secure and affordable housing provides the stability necessary for individuals and families to thrive. It creates a strong foundation for pursuing education, employment, and overall well-being. When the government prioritizes investments in housing, it reduces homelessness and social inequality, contributing to a healthier, more harmonious society.In summary, while the arts play an important role in enhancing individual expression and cultural appreciation, they should not overshadow the essential investments in education and housing. By prioritizing these basic social welfare areas, the government can guarantee a higher quality of life for its citizens, ensuring that knowledge and wisdom serve as the true determinants of societal advancement. A well-invested future in education and housing will ultimately create a more equitable and prosperous society for all.
75;Some people say the government should pay for the health care and education, but others say that it is not the government's responsibility. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Despite the development of modern society, the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens. And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens' health care and education.Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens. This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society. If citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk. As a result, such people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry. Also, without sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security. Therefore, the government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable.On the other hand, some people oppose the argument, saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society, since a great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately. Instead, the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members' wellbeing, such as soaring crime rate, AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure, which are requiring financial resources from the government to address.Personally, I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education, who are the group in real need for the authority's help. At the same time, citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas. After all, the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens.;"The debate surrounding government funding for healthcare and education is one that elicits passionate responses on both sides. Supporters of government-funded health care and education argue that it is a fundamental responsibility of the state to ensure the well-being and intellectual development of its citizens, while opponents often cite concerns regarding the effective use of public funds, fearing that such obligations may lead to waste and inefficiency.Proponents of government-funded healthcare and education emphasize the moral and social imperatives underpinning such policies. Access to health care is often viewed as a human right; when individuals are healthy, they can contribute productively to society. Moreover, equitable access to education allows for social mobility and economic opportunity, helping to break cycles of poverty. In a society where these fundamental services are guaranteed, individuals are empowered to reach their full potential, ultimately benefiting the entire community. This is particularly crucial for the marginalized and deprived, who may otherwise lack resources to afford necessary healthcare or quality education.On the other hand, critics raise valid concerns about fiscal responsibility and the potential for inefficiency in government programs. They argue that subsidizing health and education for all citizens can lead to ballooning costs and a reliance on taxpayer money, potentially stifling innovation within the private sector. However, this viewpoint often neglects the immediate needs of the most vulnerable in society, who might not survive or thrive without appropriate health care or educational opportunities.In conclusion, while there are legitimate concerns regarding the management of public funds, I firmly believe that the government should prioritize funding for health care, particularly for those who are deprived. Investing in these essential services for all, and especially for the underprivileged, reflects a commitment to social equity and helps build a healthier, more educated society."
76;Many people think zoos that keep wild animals in a man-made environment should be no longer exist in the 21st century. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Children tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen. When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society, animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned. I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education.There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system, which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals. In contrast, zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff. Once the animal got sick, professional vet will help them promptly. Thanks to the considerate care, the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed.Additionally, zoos afford a platform to education teenagers, helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals. In the zoos, even though wild animals are caged, they have capability to walk in a limited area. When children pay a visit to the zoos, they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals, which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals. Further, children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers.On the other hand, complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard. It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage. Also, being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals.In order to protect animals, from my perspective, zoos offer a good man-made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals. What the zoos should do is improvement of the management system and use the income wisely in preserving wild animals better.;"The debate over the existence of zoos and wildlife sanctuaries has long captivated the interests of animal-rights activists and the broader public. While it is true that these activists often advocate for the elimination of zoos in favor of preserving wildlife in their natural environments, I maintain that well-designed, ethical man-made environments can offer significant benefits for wildlife conservation and education. First and foremost, modern zoos have evolved far beyond their historical roots. Many are now modeled to replicate natural habitats, ensuring that animals live in environments closely resembling their native ecosystems. This not only enhances the well-being of the animals but also provides opportunities for scientific research and breeding programs that can help endangered species thrive. By fostering healthy populations of wildlife, these institutions contribute to overall biodiversity and can be instrumental in the efforts to reintroduce species into their natural habitats.Moreover, zoos play a crucial role in educating the public about wildlife conservation. By providing visitors with the opportunity to observe animals up close, zoos can inspire a sense of connection and responsibility towards wildlife. This educational aspect is vital; when people understand the challenges faced by these animals in the wild, they are more likely to support conservation initiatives and donate to related causes. The awareness cultivated in zoos can lead to a more informed public, more willing to engage in protective behaviors towards the environment.Lastly, not all habitats can be preserved in a natural state due to urbanization, climate change, and habitat destruction. In such cases, a well-managed zoo can serve as a sanctuary for species that might otherwise face extinction. To advocate for their complete ban overlooks these critical functions and the potential of a responsible approach to animal care.In conclusion, while the intention behind the animal-rights activists' stance is commendable, the practical benefits of well-run zoos should not be dismissed. By creating environments that nurture wildlife while fostering public engagement and education, we can promote a more sustainable coexistence between humans and the animal kingdom."
77;Some industrialized countries have serious environmental problems. The damage to the environment is an inevitable result when a country tends to improve the standard of living. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Currently, a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries. However, some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems. From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.Admittedly, some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments. As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards. Besides, people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems. As a result, unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources. In this view, the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting.However, I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment. With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today, triggering sales. For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.Furthermore, taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies. If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity. Therefore, it may spur its economic development. On the other hand, without the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic development.Therefore, I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously. On the other hand, I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources, technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas.;In recent years, the juxtaposition of economic growth and environmental sustainability has sparked considerable debate. Some individuals express concern that achieving economic targets in industrialized countries often comes at the expense of ecosystems. They argue that prioritizing profit and development frequently leads to the degradation of natural resources and irreversible damage to our environment. However, I firmly believe that flourishing economies can coexist harmoniously with environmental preservation, provided that sustainable practices are prioritized.Many successful economies have demonstrated that it is possible to merge economic development with ecological well-being. For instance, countries that invest in renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar, not only create jobs but also significantly reduce their carbon footprints. By adopting circular economy principles, industries can minimize waste and utilize resources more efficiently, thereby promoting sustainability while fostering economic growth.However, it is true that some countries prioritize immediate economic gains over long-term environmental protection, resulting in the ruination of local ecosystems. This can be observed in cases where deforestation occurs to make way for agriculture or urbanization, and the consequences are often dire—climate change, biodiversity loss, and health impacts on local populations. Such shortsighted policies ultimately lead to a cycle of economic insecurity, as degraded environments can no longer support livelihoods or tourism.In conclusion, while it is a valid concern that economic targets may sometimes be achieved at the expense of ecosystems, the narrative does not have to be a bleak one. By embracing sustainable practices and innovative technologies, developed countries can preserve their environmental heritage while ensuring economic prosperity. This balanced approach not only protects our planet but also fosters long-term economic resilience, proving that ecological mindfulness and economic advancement are not mutually exclusive, but rather mutually beneficial.
78;Some peopleÊargue that the government should spend money on public services and facilities, but not on the arts. Do you agree or disagree?;As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years, they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government. As a result, some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts. However, from my perspective, I think arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well.Admittedly, the government should give priority to public services and facilities. This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable. Simultaneously, public services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate. Therefore, public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability.On the other hand, I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government. Individually, arts can enrich people's cultural lives. Currently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition. Consequently, they require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure. Without arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems.From the point of the local community, funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development. Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts. This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry. In this view, arts serve cultural and economic purposes.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure. At the same time, the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous.;"The allocation of tax money has long been a contentious issue, with some arguing that funds should be directed exclusively towards publicly beneficial services, such as healthcare and education. However, I firmly believe that the arts deserve a substantial portion of government investment. Cultural initiatives play a vital role in shaping society and enriching the lives of citizens.Firstly, the arts cultivate creativity and critical thinking. They provide individuals with the tools to express themselves and to interpret the world in unique ways. From literature and theater to visual arts and music, these disciplines encourage innovation and can lead to breakthroughs in various fields. By investing in the arts, governments can foster a generation that values creativity, which is essential in an era increasingly dominated by technology and automation.Furthermore, the arts contribute significantly to the economy. Cultural sectors generate jobs, attract tourism, and stimulate local businesses. A thriving arts scene can revitalize communities, create employment opportunities, and enhance property values. From theaters and art galleries to music festivals, these endeavors not only provide entertainment but also serve as economic engines that benefit society as a whole.Additionally, art has the power to bring communities together and promote social cohesion. Public art installations, community theater, and local music events can bridge divides and foster a sense of belonging. They enable diverse groups to share their stories, celebrate their heritage, and engage with others, thereby strengthening the social fabric of the community.In conclusion, while it is essential to allocate tax money to public services, the investment in the arts should not be overlooked. The arts are not merely a luxury; they are a fundamental aspect of a healthy society that stimulates creativity, drives economic growth, and unites communities. Balancing tax allocation between public services and the arts is crucial for fostering a vibrant and equitable society."
79;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized. Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong. Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom. This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.On the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology. Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world. Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public. Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life. This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters. Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.In conclusion, both of the arguments have strong supports, but in my own view, more good come from zoos than bad. However, it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention.;The debate surrounding zoology and the ethical implications of keeping animals in captivity has garnered significant attention in recent years. Critics argue that confining animals for human enjoyment, regardless of the justification, is inherently wrong. They believe that animals should be regarded as non-human persons, possessing intrinsic rights that merit freedom. This perspective emphasizes the ethical obligation to respect animals as sentient beings with their own desires, social structures, and natural behaviors. Proponents of this view often cite the psychological and physical harm suffered by animals in captivity, highlighting that many species experience stress, boredom, and unnatural lifestyles that can lead to detrimental health effects.Conversely, advocates for zoos and similar establishments assert that these institutions play a vital role in public education and ecological balance. They contend that zoos provide opportunities for people to engage with wildlife, fostering awareness and appreciation for different species. This exposure can be pivotal in promoting conservation efforts and encouraging visitors to care about environmental issues. Furthermore, supporters argue that zoos participate in significant breeding programs for endangered species, contributing to species preservation and the restoration of natural habitats. In this context, the argument is made that well-managed zoos can serve as sanctuaries for animals that might otherwise face extinction.Thus, the discussion hinges on weighing the moral considerations of animal captivity against the potential benefits that such practices can provide for both animals and humans. It is crucial for both sides of the argument to seek common ground, exploring alternatives like sanctuaries and wildlife reserves that prioritize the welfare of animals while still allowing for public education and ecological preservation. As society advances, finding a balance between respecting animal rights and enhancing human understanding of wildlife remains an ongoing challenge that requires thoughtful dialogue and action.
81;Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone's life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is negative. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.Ê;Nowadays, the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers, radio and television has become very prevalent, so it is thought to be a necessary part of today's society. Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this. Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more. Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits. Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits. For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans. From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.However, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. Therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses.In conclusion, after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising, both of the views have strong support, but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad. Thus, the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported.;Advertising has become an integral part of modern society, influencing consumer behavior and shaping cultural norms. Many argue that the benefits of advertising significantly outweigh any negative impacts it may have. Proponents of advertising assert that it serves as a powerful tool for information dissemination. Through advertisements, consumers are notified of new products, services, and innovations that can enhance their lives. Moreover, advertising drives competition, fostering economic growth and leading to lower prices for consumers as businesses strive to attract customers. Informative advertisements can also promote social causes, encouraging support for public health, education, and community initiatives.However, critics of advertising highlight its potential negative effects, particularly in relation to consumer well-being and mental health. One significant concern is the saturation of personal devices with advertisements. Automated systems can send a barrage of targeted ads to personal phones and email addresses, which can lead to information overload, annoyance, and a sense of invasion of privacy. With the rise of sophisticated algorithms, consumers are often bombarded with advertisements tailored to their online activity, making it challenging to escape from the marketing strategies employed by companies. This persistent exposure can create unrealistic expectations and materialistic values, ultimately contributing to dissatisfaction and anxiety among consumers.Furthermore, advertising often promotes unhealthy lifestyles, especially among children. Many commercials glorify junk food, instant gratification, or unsustainable products, potentially leading to poor dietary choices and environmental harm. The ethical implications of exploiting vulnerable populations, including children and marginalized communities, also raise important questions about the responsibility of advertisers.In conclusion, while advertising can have positive effects by informing consumers and stimulating economic growth, its negative impacts cannot be overlooked. The balance between beneficial advertising and intrusive marketing practices must be carefully managed to ensure that advertising serves society positively without compromising individual well-being.
82;The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy.ÊThe advantages of nuclear technology outweigh the disadvantages. Do you agree or disagree ?;The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle. As far as my opinion is concerned, I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power. I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages.First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons. Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons. If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage.Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity. For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area. This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable.Last but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power. Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it. This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material.To sum it up, from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. Thus I suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes.;Nuclear technology has long been a topic of intense debate, often divided between advocates who argue for its efficiency and economic benefits and opponents who raise concerns about safety, environmental impact, and ethical standards. Proponents of nuclear power suggest that it serves as a reliable source of energy that can meet increasing global demands while reducing reliance on fossil fuels. They point to its capacity for generating large amounts of energy with relatively low greenhouse gas emissions, making it an attractive component in combating climate change.However, despite these potential advantages, I find myself aligned with the opponents of nuclear power. First and foremost, the risk associated with nuclear energy cannot be understated. High-profile disasters such as Chernobyl and Fukushima have shown that the consequences of nuclear accidents can be catastrophic, leading to long-lasting environmental damage and health issues. The fear of a possible meltdown or radiation leak raises legitimate concerns among populations living near nuclear facilities, fostering anxiety and societal division.Additionally, the issue of nuclear waste remains a significant challenge. Nuclear reactors produce highly radioactive waste that requires careful handling and secure long-term storage solutions, which are still not adequately resolved. Such waste poses a threat not only to human health but also to ecosystems. The prospect of leaks or contamination leaves a lasting scar on the narrative surrounding nuclear power.Moreover, the economic implications should not be overlooked. While the initial investment in nuclear technology can be substantial, the long-term costs—such as plant maintenance, waste management, and decommissioning of aging facilities—often exceed initial projections. In contrast, investing in renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power can offer safer, sustainable, and increasingly economical alternatives.In conclusion, while nuclear power may present certain advantages, the profound risks, environmental concerns, and economic uncertainties associated with its use lead me to believe that we should be pursuing safer, renewable energy sources that can support a sustainable future.
85;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city? Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays living is possible on every place of the world, but still there are some differences among them. From my point of view big cities can be a good place for bringing up children.To begin with, it is undeniable that education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides. For instance, in my country the best schools, universities and institutes are located in cities, and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children's life. Therefore, it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities.What is more, it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities. Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment. For example playgrounds, parks, science museums, cinemas etc. However, in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities. Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms.Finally, in big cities children access to media easily, so they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net. Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world, therefor they can exchange their knowledge, they can learn different cultures.To sum up, although countrysides have some advantages such as fresh air, peace, and etc. Today's children needs somethings to entertain them, and occupy their leisure time in the best way.;Big cities present numerous advantages for raising children, particularly in terms of education and recreational opportunities. One of the most significant benefits is the availability of quality educational institutions. In urban environments, schools often have more resources, specialized programs, and extracurricular activities than their rural counterparts. Cities tend to attract experienced educators and offer advanced placement courses, enabling children to receive a more comprehensive and stimulating education. This access to diverse learning opportunities is critical for child development, fostering both academic excellence and a rich understanding of the world.Moreover, big cities provide a plethora of recreational facilities that contribute to a child's physical and social well-being. From parks and community centers to sports complexes and theaters, urban areas are designed to cater to various interests. Children have countless options to engage in sports, arts, and cultural activities, allowing them not only to develop new skills but also to build friendships with peers from diverse backgrounds. This exposure to different cultures and lifestyles can significantly enhance a child's social development and global perspective.In contrast, children raised in countrysides often spend their free time at home or on farms, engaging in limited recreational activities. While rural settings can offer the charm of nature and a tranquil environment, they may lack the same level of facilities that urban areas provide. Children in these regions often participate in farm-related chores or isolated activities, which may not offer the same breadth of experiences that their urban counterparts enjoy. In conclusion, while both environments can shape children's growth in unique ways, big cities offer a distinct advantage through superior educational resources and abundant recreational facilities. These factors collectively create a more enriching environment for children, equipping them for a successful future.
86;Some people prefer to take a position in a company and work for the company. Other people think is better to go into business for themselves. Which do you think is better?;"There are many kinds of jobs in society. Some of them are done by companies that related to government, and some of them are done by privat companies. Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages, I would prefer to work for myself, and have my own business. There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others. In the first place, there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others. In your job you can be boss of yourself; however, in the other jobs someone else are your boss. You always have to be responsible for your task, and it make a stressful situation that I never like it.What is more, when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves, but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager. Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers, and from my point of view it is unfair.Finally, there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others. When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want. Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease, sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation. For all of them we have to ask for a permission, and most of the time we are not allowed.There is no doubt that working for the other have some advantages, too, but I imagine people that have their own business are more comfortable. They have more opportunities, profits, and authorities.";In today’s society, the landscape of employment is enriched by a variety of job types, spanning across governmental and private sectors. Government-related jobs typically offer stability, benefits, and a sense of contributing to the public good. These positions often come with structured work environments and systematic career advancement opportunities. However, they can sometimes be marred by bureaucracy and limitations on creativity, as employees are often required to adhere to strict regulations and procedures.On the other hand, private companies tend to promote innovation and adaptability, allowing employees to explore new ideas and foster entrepreneurial spirit. Jobs in the private sector can provide more competitive salaries and flexible work arrangements, which appeal to many individuals seeking dynamic and rewarding careers. However, these positions can also present challenges such as job insecurity, longer hours, and the ever-present risk of downsizing or layoffs due to market fluctuations.Despite the distinct advantages and disadvantages of both governmental and private employment, my inclination leans towards entrepreneurship and working for myself. Establishing my own business represents the ultimate form of professional independence, affording me the freedom to pursue my passions and innovate without the confines of traditional corporate structures. As my own boss, I would have the flexibility to craft my work environment, set my hours, and determine my business strategy—all while making decisions that align with my values and vision.Additionally, being an entrepreneur allows for the potential of unlimited growth, both personally and financially. Although there are risks involved in starting a business, the prospect of building something from the ground up and creating a lasting impact is profoundly appealing. In essence, while jobs across governmental and private sectors offer valuable experiences and lessons, the opportunity to create and manage my own venture stands out as the most compelling choice for my professional journey.
87;"The expression ""Never,never give up"" means keep trying and never stop working for your goal. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?";"Many individuals throughout their life face with at least one failure in different areas such as education, love and economy. Some believe when a person faces with a failure the best way is to forget that and releases that; however, I completely disagree with this idea. I always believe that a defeated person has to try and try until to achieve her or his goal. First of all, when people face with a failure they can learn a large number of things from that failure, therefore in the next effort they try to avoid doing and repeating that mistakes. For instance, most of inventors in the first phases of their job face with some problems and defeats, but in the next stages they learn how to deal with problems.Second of all, experience shows while people doing a job constantly, they become more experienced in that subject, so in the final effort they become successful with the high percentile. For example, scientists experiment a substance for a long time, after they gain lots of experience and knowledge about that subject they decide to make it final.To sum up, I would maintain that people should not give up when they face with a failure. In opposite, they have to learn new points from that failure, and they become more experienced.";"Failure is a universal experience that most individuals encounter at least once in various aspects of life, be it education, relationships, or financial stability. While some advocate for the approach of simply forgetting failures and moving on, I maintain that facing and embracing these setbacks can be crucial for personal growth and resilience.Firstly, confronting failure allows individuals to extract valuable lessons from their experiences. For instance, a student who fails an exam has the opportunity to analyze their study habits and identify areas for improvement. This process of self-reflection enables them to adopt better strategies in the future, ultimately leading to academic success. Similarly, in romantic relationships, experiencing heartbreak can provide insights into one’s desires and expectations, which can lead to healthier partnerships in the future.Additionally, resilience is a vital skill cultivated through overcoming failure. Life is inevitably fraught with challenges, and those who learn to navigate setbacks are often better equipped to handle future adversities. The story of renowned figures, such as Thomas Edison, who famously said, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work,"" exemplifies the importance of persistence. His numerous failures in inventing the lightbulb eventually culminated in groundbreaking success, illustrating that perseverance is integral to achieving one’s goals.Moreover, failure can instill a sense of humility and empathy. Those who have faced difficulties often develop a deeper understanding of others' struggles, fostering stronger relationships and a more compassionate outlook on life. This interconnectedness among individuals can create a supportive community where members encourage one another to rise after falling.In conclusion, while some may advocate for forgetting failures, I believe that confronting and learning from them is paramount. Embracing failure not only facilitates personal development but also fosters resilience, empathy, and deeper connections with others. Therefore, rather than shying away from failure, individuals should strive to face it head-on and use it as a springboard for future successes."
88;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree with this point of view?;Nowadays there are some issues which many countries and nations are concern about that. Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals. From my point of view although endangered animals are important, human needs should be considered more.Firstly, day by day population is increasing, so human needs for food is increasing as well. We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn, and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks. Therefore, farmlands are vital for human life.Secondly, people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals, so they need land to build their houses on it. Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable.Finally, human need some crucial things to continue their life, and most of them are industrial such as medicine. Therefore, some lands should be assigned to industry. Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry. To conclude, the population of endangered animals are less than people's population, so they do not need so much land that people need. I would maintain that nowadays humans need farmland, housing and industry because of increasing population are more important than saving land for endangered animals.;While the plight of endangered animals is a pressing issue, the rapidly growing human population necessitates prioritizing human needs. As our population expands, so too does the demand for food. With millions of new mouths to feed each year, the agricultural sector faces enormous pressure to produce more crops and livestock. This need for increased food production often leads to deforestation and habitat destruction, creating a conflict between conservation efforts for endangered species and the need to sustain a burgeoning population.Furthermore, as people continue to flock to urban areas, the demand for housing intensifies. Shelters are vital for protecting individuals and families from environmental elements and ensuring a safe living space. The expansion of cities and towns increasingly consumes land that could serve as habitats for endangered animals. While these developments are necessary for human survival and well-being, they result in habitat fragmentation and loss of biodiversity. This raises a complex ethical question: how do we balance the urgent need for human shelter with the equally pressing need to preserve natural ecosystems?Additionally, human comfort and industrial progress rely on resources extracted from nature. Industries that manufacture goods necessary for modern life, from clothing to technology, often encroach on wildlife habitats, leading to the extinction of several animal species. While innovation and development are essential for human advancement, they should ideally occur in a sustainable manner that considers the impact on biodiversity.In conclusion, while the conservation of endangered animals is undeniably important, the needs of humanity often take precedence due to escalating population pressures, shelter requirements, and industrial demands. Striking a balance between conservation and development remains a challenge that society must confront, with the aim of fostering a sustainable coexistence for both humans and wildlife.
89;One should never judge a person by external appearance. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Individuals have two features, one of them is appearance and the other one is personality. From my point of view although appearance is important, personality is the most important. We can never judge about a person with his or her appearance. Some people believes, individuals who have black skin or are frown are not good person and in opposite individuals who have pale or white skin or always have smile on their face are good person. I completely disagree with these kind of judgement which someone makes.First of all, there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing, therefore we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance. For example, some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken; however, after getting marriage they show their real personality.Second of all, there are some people who are black skin, fat and frown, nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague. For instance, I have a neighbor who are old, black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her. One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys, so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home. She asked me to stay with her till my parents come, also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable. After that I understood, I had to never judge with people's appearance.All in all, the best way to judge about individuals' is to be familiar with their personality not with their appearance. Unfortunately, many people play role to cheat the others, and they try to hide their real personality with their appearance.";When examining the essence of individuality, two defining features emerge: appearance and personality. Both contribute to how we are perceived and understood, but they serve different roles in shaping our interactions and relationships. I contend that while appearance can create initial impressions, personality stands out as the most significant determinant of a person's true character and worth.Appearance often plays a crucial role in first encounters. Society tends to place considerable emphasis on physical attributes, with appearances influencing judgments and expectations. People may react favorably or unfavorably based on someone’s looks, leading to the age-old adage of “don’t judge a book by its cover.” While a pleasant appearance may open doors and create opportunities, it is personality that sustains relationships. Individuals who rely solely on their looks may find themselves lacking depth in their connections and personal fulfillment.In contrast, personality encompasses our emotional disposition, communication style, values, and behavior. It is the lens through which others experience us, shaping interactions and fostering trust and empathy. An individual with a vibrant personality can attract and maintain friendships, inspire loyalty, and create a positive atmosphere that transcends superficial judgments. Traits like kindness, humor, and integrity contribute to long-lasting relationships and meaningful engagements.Additionally, a strong personality can drive personal and professional success. It is often said that people hire for skill but fire for attitude. Those with attractive personalities not only excel in their careers but also leave a lasting impact on their communities.In conclusion, while appearance can undoubtedly be a fleeting asset, personality is the cornerstone of genuine human connection. It is personality that fosters deeper understanding, emotional bonds, and lasting relationships. Ultimately, it is our inner qualities that define us far beyond the superficiality of appearance.
90;Some people believe that there should be a single international language. Others believe that this would make it difficult to maintain the identity of cultures. What's your opinion?;The 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization, which raises people's concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not. From my perspective, a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people.It is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation. As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation. In contrast, without the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them. Therefore, a single international language serves an economic purpose.Also, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions. If people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles. For example, when people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience.In spite of this, the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied. To be more specific, a single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation. This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong. For instance, some Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries, due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English.Therefore, I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication. On the other hand, every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage.;The emergence of a single international language plays a pivotal role in fostering global economic cooperation, offering a common platform for communication among diverse nations. In today’s interconnected world, trade, investment, and diplomatic relations are increasingly reliant on effective communication. A universal language, such as English, facilitates negotiations, enhances collaboration, and reduces misunderstandings among countries. This linguistic commonality not only streamlines business operations, enabling companies to operate across borders with ease, but also leads to increased opportunities for economic growth and development. Moreover, a universal language serves as an indispensable tool for cultural communication and interactions. It enables individuals from different backgrounds to share ideas, values, and experiences, fostering mutual understanding and respect. This cultural exchange enriches global society, allowing individuals to appreciate diverse perspectives and traditions. The dissemination of knowledge, arts, and philosophies through a common linguistic framework enhances global citizenship, bridging gaps between cultures and promoting a sense of unity.However, while the benefits of a universal language are manifold, it is crucial that countries do not disregard the importance of preserving their cultural heritage. A rich tapestry of languages and dialects characterizes humanity’s cultural diversity, each representing unique histories and identities. Cultural heritage provides a sense of belonging and fosters pride among communities. Therefore, nations should actively promote and protect their indigenous languages and traditions. Emphasizing bilingual or multilingual education can help maintain cultural practices while also equipping citizens with the necessary skills to engage in the global economy.In conclusion, while a single international language is integral to economic cooperation and cultural communication, it is equally vital to preserve and celebrate the myriad of languages and cultures that enrich our world. Balancing these aspects can lead to a more inclusive and harmonious global society, where economic collaboration does not come at the expense of cultural heritage.
91;Fashion trends are difficult to follow these days and it is believed that they primarily just to sell clothes. Some people believe that we should not follow them and that we should dress in what we like. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;With increasing availability to the Internet, people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world, such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year. However, some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends. From my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles.This is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations, which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today. When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world's cutting-edge fashion information, they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world, which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world. In contrast, if they stuck to their own fashion styles, disregarding the world's top fashion designers' achievements, they would stay conservative in their own worlds. As a result, they might fall behind shortly.Furthermore, people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information. Without following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles.Despite this, it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals' personalities. Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends, which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes. Consequently, the world would look monotonous.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that people should, especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge, care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world's changes. On the other hand, creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas, developing their own fashion styles as they like.;"The debate between personal style and fashion trends has gained significant traction over the years, stirring opinions on how individuals should express themselves through clothing. While some advocate for personal styles as a means of individual expression, I firmly believe that following fashion trends holds greater importance in our ever-evolving society. Fashion trends not only reflect the latest transformations in culture and society but also serve as a unifying language that connects people across various backgrounds.First and foremost, embracing fashion trends allows individuals to stay current with the continuous changes in the world. Fashion is inherently dynamic, influenced by social movements, technological advancements, and cultural shifts. Participating in these trends enables individuals to engage with contemporary ideas and innovations, providing a shared context for societal discussions. For instance, sustainable fashion has emerged as a significant trend, urging consumers to reassess their shopping habits and contribute positively to the environment. By following such trends, people participate in larger conversations about sustainability and ethics, creating awareness and promoting change.Moreover, fashion trends foster a sense of community and belonging. When people dress in similar styles, they share a connection with others who appreciate those trends. This camaraderie can manifest in various environments, such as workplaces, social gatherings, or among peers. Trends create collective experiences that allow individuals to bond over their shared tastes and preferences, enhancing social interactions and fostering relationships.In conclusion, while personal style undoubtedly holds its significance in self-expression, fashion trends play a crucial role in keeping individuals connected to the global zeitgeist. By following trends, people can navigate the complexities of modern life, engage with societal dialogues, and foster a sense of belonging among peers. Thus, embracing fashion trends is not merely about aesthetics; it is an essential aspect of participating in the world around us."
92;Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth among poorer nations by providing such things as food and education? Or is it the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves?;"Whether wealthy nations should take responsibilities to help poorer ones, by means of providing infrastructures, or remain bystander of the global poverty, is an issue of controversy. Personally I think, as the privileged minority, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor.In terms of ethics, it is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help, especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so. Compassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals.Economically speaking, such aid could also create a win-win situation. Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds. For developed nations, new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem, promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry. The potential market in those poor countries, most of which has a huge population, is also a thing worth mentioning. By building a good relationship with them, wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market, but also facilitate future international commerce. The underdeveloped nations, in return, may export local agricultural products, mineral products with discount to the former, boosting each other's economy.In summary, wealthy nations' offering in need is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways. Only those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run.";The debate surrounding the responsibility of wealthy nations to assist poorer countries remains a pressing issue in the modern world. It is not only a moral obligation but a humanitarian imperative to extend support to those suffering from famine and poverty. To observe fellow human beings struggling against the harsh realities of life without the means to secure basic necessities and survive is nothing short of inhumane. The vast resources and wealth accumulated in affluent nations stand in stark contrast to the dire circumstances faced by many around the globe. This disparity demands action.Sharing their fortune with poorer nations is not merely a charitable act but is also a strategic investment in the global community. Economically speaking, such aid can create a win-win situation for both donors and recipients. When wealthier countries provide assistance, they enable developing nations to stabilize their economies, improve educational and healthcare outcomes, and ultimately bolster their production capacities. This, in turn, can create new markets for goods and services produced by wealthier nations, stimulating global trade and fostering interdependence that nurtures economic growth.Furthermore, aiding poorer countries can decrease the social and political instability that often arises from extreme poverty. This instability can spill over borders, leading to conflicts that threaten global security. By investing in development aid, wealthy nations can contribute to peaceful and prosperous societies, reducing the likelihood of refugee crises and international conflicts.In conclusion, the moral imperative to alleviate the suffering of those living in poverty aligns closely with pragmatic economic considerations. Wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune, fostering a more equitable world that benefits all. The act of compassion can yield beneficial returns, establishing a global environment where prosperity, stability, and mutual respect prevail.
93;Out of our country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spend on health education and preventative measures.ÊTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment. Once applied, it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments.Health education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations. First of all, thank to a full health education from their childhoods, children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences. For example, if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age, he also keeps it when older. Secondly, health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases. Instead of afraid or panic, they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes. Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment. Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly.Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens. For example, vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu, smallpox, rubella so on. When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country, the community's health state will be improved remarkably. As human resources play a key role in the development of a country, investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision. In addition, because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention, the government can save a lot of money for our country's health budget.In conclusion, I strongly agree that we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment. However, reasonable attentions should be paid to treatment so that our citizens are always looked after with best services.;Health education is a cornerstone contributing to the long-term well-being of future generations. By instilling a robust understanding of health principles, individuals are equipped with the necessary knowledge to protect themselves from the myriad risks associated with diseases. This proactive approach fosters a culture of wellness that does not merely react to health crises but anticipates and mitigates them through informed decision-making.One of the most significant benefits of health education lies in its preventive nature. By learning about risk factors associated with various diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, individuals can adopt healthier lifestyles that incorporate regular physical activity, balanced nutrition, and mental well-being. This foundation ensures that future generations are not only aware of the importance of personal health but also empowered to make choices that enhance their quality of life.Moreover, the emphasis on prevention has far-reaching implications for public health. As communities become more health-conscious, there is a collective shift toward practices that improve the overall health state of citizens. This cultural change can lead to decreased morbidity rates, contributing to a healthier populace that is less burdened by the social and economic costs of chronic illnesses. Additionally, the financial aspect of health education cannot be overlooked. The cost of treatment for diseases often far exceeds the investment in preventive measures. Health education programs, which may require a comparatively modest financial commitment, can save healthcare systems substantial amounts by reducing the incidence and severity of diseases. Ultimately, the focus on prevention leads to fewer hospital visits, decreased pharmaceutical expenses, and a reduction in the overall economic burden on society.In conclusion, health education is a vital tool in shaping a healthier future for our next generations. By equipping individuals with the knowledge to prevent diseases and make informed health choices, we not only enhance individual well-being but also contribute to the collective prosperity of society as a whole. Investing in health education is a proactive measure with enduring benefits that will resonate for years to come.
94;The popularity of news media often has significant influence on people' lives. Some people believe that to be a negative development. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays news media have become more and more popular. Many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits. However, it is possible that this idea is not completely true. It is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment, but also polishes up people' knowledge. Therefore, it seems not unreasonable to suggest that this is a positive development.First and foremost, today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before. The fact is that such news media as televisions, radios, or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody. People can sit in front of their televisions and watch whatever they want, from musical concerts to live football match. This is a convenient way of relaxation after hard work. Obviously, the popularity of news media is beneficial to human beings.In addition to this, news media help people broaden their knowledge. It is clearly seen that mass media provide people with a variety of global news on all fields, including political situation, economic change, global warming, and so forth. Hence, there is a strong likelihood that today people are able to know the world better. This is particularly essential when the globalization process has been permeating into all areas of society. Indeed, the fast growth of news media is helpful for people worldwide.In conclusion, the development of news media has been making great inroads into the lives of all people. It relaxes people with plentiful entertainment news. It enriches people's knowledge with worldwide information. It also positively affects the way people live in many other aspects. Therefore, the progress of news media is an advantageous development.;The role of news media in contemporary society has become a topic of heated debate, with many asserting that its drawbacks outweigh its merits. Critics point to issues like sensationalism, misinformation, and the pervasive spread of negativity, which can lead to anxiety and other adverse effects on mental health. However, despite these concerns, it is essential to consider the significant advantages that news media provides, particularly in the realms of entertainment and education.One of the most prominent merits of news media is its ability to entertain. From engaging storytelling to compelling human interest pieces, news outlets often captivate audiences and keep them informed about current events in a way that is accessible and engaging. This entertainment factor serves not only as a source of relaxation but also fosters a sense of community among viewers and readers who share common interests and concerns about the world around them.Moreover, news media plays a crucial role in enhancing public knowledge. In an increasingly complex and interconnected world, staying informed about local and global events is imperative. News outlets provide critical insights into politics, culture, science, and technology, helping the public grasp the implications of these developments. This awareness empowers individuals to make informed decisions and engage in meaningful discussions, thus contributing to a more educated society. The analytical pieces, expert opinions, and various viewpoints presented in news media also encourage critical thinking and open-mindedness, promoting a culture of debate and understanding.In conclusion, while it is undeniable that news media has its drawbacks, its contributions to entertainment and knowledge acquisition cannot be overlooked. The ability to engage audiences while informing them about vital issues is a testament to its positive impact on society. Therefore, rather than dismissing news media's influence outright, it is reasonable to recognize it as a beneficial development in our ever-evolving world.
96;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Whenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place, it attracts millions of people all over the world. As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border, popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely.First and foremost, sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results, break records and bring victories to their own countries. Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events, there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures. Consequently, sport events with the spirit of healthiness, honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding, friendship and solidarity among nations. After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition, the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners, which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations.Secondly, sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators. Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete. The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country. When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness. For instance, when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets. People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President. The eager atmosphere lasted many next days. In fact, some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally. However, the hooligans only took a minority of people. Therefore, it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen.In conclusion, international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely. Hence, I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future.;"International sporting occasions, such as the FIFA World Cup, serve as powerful platforms for reducing international tensions and fostering national pride in a safe and healthy environment. The spirited competition inherent in these events often transcends national borders, allowing nations to engage in a peaceful celebration of athletic prowess. The thrill of competition brings together individuals from diverse backgrounds, creating a shared experience that cultivates understanding and camaraderie across cultures.Sport embodies values of healthiness, honesty, and fairness, which are essential in promoting solidarity among nations. As athletes compete, they not only showcase their skills but also represent their countries, uniting fans in a collective display of patriotism. This sense of belonging can diffuse nationalistic tensions, as people from rival nations come together to appreciate the principles of fair play and sportsmanship. The universal appeal of these values encourages a spirit of friendship, where competition is viewed as a means of personal and collective growth rather than a source of conflict.Moreover, sporting occasions act as a catalyst for heightened patriotic emotions among both athletes and spectators. The pride exhibited during international tournaments can evoke a sense of national identity and unity, inspiring citizens to rally behind their teams. This pride often extends beyond the realm of sports, reinforcing social bonds and encouraging a collective sense of purpose. The spectacle of national flags waving in the stadium and the exhilaration that accompanies victory can bridge gaps and promote peaceful coexistence, transforming sporting events into a celebration of human spirit and resilience.In conclusion, international sporting occasions are more than just competitions; they are vital instruments for promoting understanding, friendship, and solidarity among nations. By fostering a spirit of healthiness, honesty, and fairness, these events play a crucial role in enhancing national pride while simultaneously working to reduce international tensions, paving the way for a more harmonious global community."
97;In many countries, children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard as completely wrong, while others consider it as some kind of work experience, important for learning and taking responsibilities.ÊWhat are your opinions on this?;In many countries, children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions. Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities. However, some people think it's not a good educational measure. From my point of view, the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks.First of all, children can learn about the hardship of earning money. When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies, doing housework and keeping shops, they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life. Therefore, they are likely to understand their parents' hardship, to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving.Secondly, when children take jobs, they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working. To keep their jobs, children will have to try their best to finish their duties. For example, if a child works as a shop assistant, he will have to keep an eye on good and products, calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost.Some people may argue that children will be more material, neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers. However, if children get good care and instructions from their parents, they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way.In conclusion, if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents' permission, they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible. I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children 's study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children's labour.;In numerous countries, the educational approach encourages children from a young age to develop independence and take responsibility for their actions. This often involves engaging them in paid work, which some critics argue may not be a beneficial educational measure. However, I firmly believe that the advantages of such involvement far outweigh the potential drawbacks.One of the primary benefits of allowing children to engage in paid work is the acquisition of essential life skills. When children take on jobs, whether it be simple tasks like babysitting or more formal roles like working at a local store, they learn important skills such as time management, communication, and teamwork. These experiences foster a sense of responsibility and help children understand the value of hard work. As they manage their schedules and deal with real-world challenges, they prepare for greater responsibilities in adulthood.Moreover, paid work encourages financial literacy from an early age. By earning their own money, children learn about budgeting, saving, and spending wisely. This early exposure to economic concepts helps them develop a responsible attitude toward finances, which is crucial in today’s consumer-driven world. A strong understanding of money management can prevent many young adults from making financial mistakes that could haunt them later in life.On the other hand, critics argue that engaging in paid work can detract from academic pursuits or childhood enjoyment. While this concern is valid, it is essential to strike a balance. Establishing a structured schedule that allows for both education and work can teach children priority management and the importance of maintaining a well-rounded life.In conclusion, promoting independence through paid work offers children invaluable lessons in responsibility, financial literacy, and essential life skills. Despite some concerns about potential drawbacks, the positive impacts of such educational measures ultimately prepare children for the complexities of adult life, making it a worthwhile endeavor.
98;In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Nowadays, it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies. It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students. Students take a break of year or two, some students travel all around the world during this time, and some choose to take up a job.Experience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people and even at job goes long way. It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent. Student's who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies. This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life. They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses.Taking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts. Once student's starts earning, they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence. They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment. There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education. Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education, which will help them to get a better job and salaries. This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs, one needs a proper and higher qualification.In my view point, I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education. Students who take break, gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working. They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature.;In recent years, the trend of taking a gap year before embarking on university studies has become increasingly popular among students. This interlude often serves as a pivotal period for personal growth and exploration. During this time, many students choose to travel, immersing themselves in diverse cultures and experiences across the globe. Others opt to enter the workforce, where they gain invaluable practical skills and insight into the professional world. Regardless of the route taken, the experiences gained during this time significantly enhance both confidence and independence.Traveling provides students with the unique opportunity to step outside their comfort zones. As they navigate unfamiliar territories, communicate with locals, and face unforeseen challenges, their adaptability and problem-solving skills are sharpened. Meeting people from varied backgrounds fosters a broader worldview, encouraging empathy and cultural appreciation, which are essential traits in today's interconnected society. The ability to take risks and relish new experiences ultimately empowers students, instilling a deep sense of self-assuredness that can positively influence their academic pursuits.On the other hand, taking up a job during this period offers substantial benefits as well. Students learn to manage their time, work under pressure, and collaborate with diverse teams. These responsibilities contribute to a strong work ethic and a sense of accountability, which are invaluable in higher education and beyond. Furthermore, the financial independence gained from working can alleviate the monetary burden of university tuition and living expenses.In conclusion, whether through travel or employment, the experiences accumulated during a gap year play a crucial role in shaping a student's identity. This transformative period not only equips them with practical skills but also fosters the resilience and confidence necessary for success in their future academic or professional endeavors. Embracing this trend can ultimately lead to a more well-rounded and prepared individual ready to face the challenges of university life.
99;The qualities a person needs to become successful in today's world cannot be learned at a university or similar academic institution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's modern and competitive society, it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life. Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions. I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree. Nevertheless, I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities.First and foremost, it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor, engineer and lawyer. Without proper training and knowledge, it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers. Not only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners. This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals.Looking from another perspective, there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university. Take for instance those who start their own business. These people depend solely on hard work and luck. Interestingly, for some of them it proved to be a profitable job. To cite an example, Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19. Initially, he started his computer company in his college dorm room. Eventually, he used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now.In addition, people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life. This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports. The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph. To illustrate this further, David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many. Hence, it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful.To wrap it all up, it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper. However, it would be wrong to say that one's success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions. Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress.;In today’s modern and competitive society, it is undeniable that equipping ourselves with an abundance of knowledge and skills is essential for achieving success. The pressure to excel academically and professionally often leads individuals to believe that a university education is the only pathway to success. I agree with this notion to some extent, as higher education can provide invaluable knowledge, critical thinking abilities, and networking opportunities. However, I believe it is equally important to recognize that success can also be attained outside the traditional academic route, particularly in sectors such as entertainment and sports.The entertainment industry showcases numerous individuals who have achieved great success without formal education credentials. Take, for example, celebrities like Jennifer Lopez and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. Although both of them pursued various forms of training, they did not complete their college degrees before making significant impacts in their respective fields. Their talent, dedication, and the ability to connect with audiences show that skills can often outweigh formal education. In this context, passion, hard work, and practical experience can pave the way for remarkable achievements.Similarly, in sports, we see countless athletes who have forged successful careers, often opting to leave college early to pursue professional sports. LeBron James, for instance, entered the NBA directly from high school and has since become one of the most successful basketball players in history. His journey illustrates that talent, coupled with commitment and perseverance, can lead to professional success, irrespective of traditional academic achievements.In conclusion, while knowledge and skills acquired through formal education play a significant role in personal and professional development, it is vital to acknowledge that success can also stem from unstructured paths. In fields like entertainment and sports, creativity, talent, and hard work can shine brighter than any degree, reminding us that the journey to success is diverse and multi-faceted.
101;Some people claim that public museums and art galleries will not be needed because people can see historical objects and works by using computer. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"I believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary, even though we can see the art works and historical objects online.Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience. We can browse the art work from all over the world at home. However, people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size. By contrast, the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling. For example, only when we see the real mummy, can we experience mystique.In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits, museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing. For example, at American Museum of Natural History, you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum's stegosaurus; at Museum of Art in New York, you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music. While if you ""visit"" the museum online, you may not able to get this kind of experience.Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes. For instance, you can't see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist. What's more, not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen. Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough. These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects.In conclusion, I believe we still need museums and art galleries but computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects.";In the rapidly evolving digital age, the prevalence of online resources has transformed the way we interact with art and history. While it is undeniable that public museums and art galleries face competition from the vast offerings available on the internet, the need for these institutions remains as crucial as ever. Despite the convenience of viewing artworks and historical objects online, the experience lacks a depth that can only be achieved in a physical setting.One of the primary advantages of online access is the sheer convenience it offers. With just a few clicks, individuals can explore curated collections from around the world, view high-resolution images of masterpieces, and learn about artifacts without the constraints of time and location. This accessibility makes art and history more reachable, especially for those who may not have the opportunity to visit museums in person. However, the virtual experience, limited to screen sizes, often diminishes the profound impact that physical proximity to art can invoke.When standing in front of a painting or an artifact, audiences can engage with the work on a visceral level that transcends superficial viewing. The nuances of texture, the scale of a sculpture, and the interplay of light can evoke emotions and intellectual responses that are often lost in a digital format. Furthermore, public museums and galleries serve as communal spaces where people can gather, share insights, and connect through shared experiences, fostering a cultural dialogue that cannot be replicated online.Additionally, artworks are imbued with history and context that come alive in a physical setting. Museums often provide curatorial narratives that offer deeper insight into the cultural background and significance of the pieces on display. This narrative, combined with the atmosphere of the museum, creates an immersive experience that feeds the human spirit.In conclusion, while the internet provides convenient access to art and historical objects, public museums and art galleries are irreplaceable. They offer unparalleled experiences that enrich our understanding of art and culture, making them essential institutions for future generations.
102;Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?;Courts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant, except those of the UK and Australia. Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries.Many people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions, which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury. We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant's personality. Furthermore, past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes, such as kidnapping or a murder.Nevertheless, in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience, the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only. For instance, a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record. Innocent suspects, eventually, can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions.In conclusion, I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant's history to the jury, with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict. Thus, I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia, and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions.;In many judicial systems worldwide, juries are often presented with a defendant’s history to assess their character and potential future behavior. This practice, however, is notably absent in the courts of the United Kingdom and Australia, where legal principles dictate that only evidence pertinent to the specific case at hand should be considered. The rationale behind this is grounded in the belief that past behavior can unduly influence a jury's decision-making process, potentially leading to biased outcomes. A significant number of individuals maintain the perspective that a person's history acts as an indicator of future actions. This viewpoint stems from the psychological concept that patterns of behavior tend to recur, suggesting that a defendant's past might foretell their future conduct. However, this belief can lead to unfair prejudgments, overshadowing the fundamental principle of justice: that every individual is entitled to a fair trial based on evidence presented in the current case. Thus, the jury’s role is to evaluate the inherent facts and circumstances surrounding the alleged crime, rather than the defendant's past transgressions.For a jury to arrive at an objective and impartial verdict, it is crucial for the court to restrict its focus solely to evidence relevant to the case. Introducing a defendant's historical behavior risks prompting emotional responses from jurors, leading them to draw unsupported conclusions about guilt or innocence. This principle of limiting evidence is vital not only to uphold the integrity of the judicial process but also to safeguard the defendant's right to a fair trial. Ultimately, while a defendant's past might offer context, it should not overshadow the principles of justice that emphasize individual accountability and the presumption of innocence.
103;University lecturers are now able to put their lectures on the internet for students to read and so the importance of attending face to face lectures has been reduced. Do you believe the use of Internet in formal education is a good idea and what are the effects that the internet has on future academic study?Ê;Over the past few decades, the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization, especially in field of education. This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students. Consequently, direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized. However, the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists. Personally, I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning.First and foremost, the Internet is an adequate source of academic information, which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils. Nowadays, not only are lectures available online, it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace. As such, the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever. Moreover, with the use of the Internet, distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance. College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries. Last but not least, the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying. While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes, Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query.In the near future, the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, for the enormous benefits that it brings about. Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously? This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances.Critics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively, for instance internet abuse and black webs. However, we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself. Thus, what we are to do is a change in learners' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study.After analyzing both points of view, I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process. It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages. However, it is not just the matter of help or hindrance, it is the way you use the cyberspace. Be wise and conscious.;The impact of the Internet on schooling remains an intriguing and multifaceted issue that has sparked considerable debate among educationists. As technology continues to evolve, the Internet's role in academic training is set to expand, becoming an indispensable resource for both students and educators. The myriad benefits it brings to the educational landscape cannot be overlooked.Firstly, the Internet provides unparalleled access to information, enabling students to explore vast subject matter beyond what is typically covered in traditional classrooms. Online resources, such as academic journals, educational videos, and interactive platforms, enrich the learning experience and foster a more autonomous approach to education. With just a few clicks, learners can collaborate with peers from around the globe, accessing diverse perspectives that enhance critical thinking and problem-solving skills.Moreover, the Internet facilitates personalized learning, allowing students to learn at their own pace. Adaptive learning technologies can tailor educational content based on individual needs, making it particularly beneficial for those who may struggle in conventional settings. This customization promotes inclusivity and recognizes the unique learning styles of each student.However, critics argue that the Internet also has several drawbacks that could negatively impact the education system. One significant concern is the potential for distraction. With social media and entertainment platforms readily accessible, students may find it difficult to focus on their studies. Additionally, the digital divide remains a pressing issue, as not all students have equal access to technology and the Internet, potentially exacerbating existing inequalities in education.In conclusion, while the Internet undoubtedly presents challenges within the educational framework, its benefits are overwhelming. As we move towards a future where the Internet becomes integral to academic training, it is essential to address potential drawbacks, ensuring that all students can harness the positive aspects of this technological revolution in their learning journey.
104;Many people in the undeveloped world die from diseases that are curable because they can't afford the medication to treat themselves. Do you believe that drug companies in the developed world should be obliged to make their products available at reduced prices in these undeveloped countries so that people do not die unnecessarily?;At present, a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases. It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths.Admittedly, more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines. The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs. With advanced technology, the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines, which can cure a variety of serious illnesses. If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs, their health situations may be better. The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity.However, the current cost of medicines is , in fact, reasonable and based on the medicines' effectiveness. Apparently, the process of researching, testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money. Moreover, these products prove to ensure human health completely. Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs, they would make no profit, even running up debt because of production expenditure. Therefore, the measure cannot be adopted, otherwise those companies will go into liquidation. In short, this is not a long-term solution.Fortunately, there are other measures to improve the situation. It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes. Additionally, charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free.In conclusion, I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines, which may exacerbate their qualities. Instead, the government and medical foundations should be responsible for the distribution of drugs to the undeveloped world at a more reasonable price.;In many poor countries, the fundamental struggle for survival is exacerbated by a paradoxical reality: a significant number of patients are succumbing to preventable deaths due to the lack of access to medication rather than the diseases themselves. In this context, the call for pharmaceutical companies in developed nations to lower their prices on medicines gains momentum. Advocates argue that reducing costs could alleviate the financial burden on healthcare systems in low-income regions and ultimately save lives. However, this proposal invites a critical examination of the current pricing structures and the rationale behind them.Many pharmaceutical companies argue that the existing prices of medications reflect their effectiveness, extensive research and development costs, and the need to sustain innovation. Developing new drugs involves years of rigorous testing, significant financial investment, and navigating complex regulatory environments. The high prices often correlate with the therapeutic benefits provided, which can be life-saving. This raises the question of whether it is just to expect companies to compromise their pricing models without addressing the underlying challenges they face.Furthermore, reducing prices indiscriminately could have unintended consequences. It may incentivize companies to invest less in research and development, especially for diseases prevalent in low-income countries, as they start to view these markets as less profitable. This could lead to a stagnant pipeline of new treatments, further endangering public health.To effectively tackle the issue of unnecessary deaths from lack of medication in poorer nations, a multifaceted approach is essential. This may include fostering partnerships between pharmaceutical companies and governments to create equitable pricing models, enhancing infrastructure for healthcare distribution, and promoting generic alternatives when feasible. By striking a balance between fair pricing and incentivizing innovation, we can work towards a future where effective medication is accessible to all, regardless of their geographic or economic status.
105;Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree?;The awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors. As a result, some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area. It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run.Firstly, it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time. Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking. A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases. Therefore, the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented.Secondly, the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender. For instance, the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés, hospital and shopping street. This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result, Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness. This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole.To sum up, the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation. It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country.;The growing awareness of the harmful effects of smoking has profoundly influenced public perception and behavior, leading to increased pressure on both government and private sectors to take action. Recent studies have highlighted the myriad health risks associated with tobacco use, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory illnesses. As the general public becomes more informed about these dangers, there is a concomitant demand for safer environments, particularly in shared public spaces.In response to this rising awareness, many businesses have adopted strict non-smoking policies within their premises. This proactive stance not only safeguards the well-being of employees and customers but also enhances the overall image of the business as socially responsible and health-conscious. Employers recognize that a smoke-free environment can lead to improved productivity, reduced healthcare costs, and a more positive workplace culture. As such, the private sector plays a critical role in setting cultural norms around smoking.Similarly, governments worldwide have implemented legislation to restrict smoking in public areas. This includes banning smoking in parks, restaurants, and public transport, aimed at protecting non-smokers from secondhand smoke exposure and fostering a healthier community. Such legal measures reflect a commitment to public health and demonstrate governmental accountability in addressing health issues that affect society as a whole.In the long run, these initiatives contribute significantly to enhancing the quality of health across populations and improving the image of nations. Smoke-free policies can lead to decreased smoking rates, lower incidence of smoking-related diseases, and reduced healthcare spending. Moreover, countries that prioritize public health and well-being tend to attract tourism and foreign investment, thereby boosting their economy.In conclusion, the collective efforts of the public, private sectors, and governmental bodies towards reducing smoking not only promote healthier lifestyles but also positively impact the nation's overall health and global standing. Through such collaborative endeavors, a brighter, smoke-free future can be envisioned.
106;Some people say we humans are harming the Earth through our activities, but other people say we are improving the quality of life on our planet. Which opinion do you agree with ?;"""Save the planet Earth"" is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world. There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments. Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable, but concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons.Firstly, rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world. The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life. As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas. Moreover, wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth.Secondly, large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer. Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays. To add to it, excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers.Lastly, either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth. For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent. Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers.To conclude, Earth is our home and it should be protected. Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage. Creative ideas should be encouraged to leave minimum environmental footprints without compromising quality of life.";"""Save the planet Earth"" is a phrase that echoes through campaigns, classrooms, and conversations around the globe, encapsulating the urgent plea for environmental stewardship. The necessity to protect our planet is underscored by various pressing issues, one of which is the alarming depletion of the ozone layer, largely attributed to human activity. Carbon monoxide and other greenhouse gases, particularly from the widespread use of refrigerants in devices such as air conditioners, pose a significant threat to this crucial protective layer.The ozone layer serves as Earth's shield against the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which can lead to skin cancer, cataracts, and other health issues in living organisms. Unfortunately, the large-scale emissions of carbon monoxide and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) from refrigerants have contributed substantially to its thinning. As we continue to prioritize convenience and comfort in our lives, our reliance on air conditioning units has surged, resulting in increased greenhouse gas emissions. This situation necessitates a multi-faceted response. First, it is imperative to raise awareness about the impact of our daily choices on the environment. Public education campaigns can help individuals understand how reducing the use of refrigerants and opting for eco-friendly alternatives can mitigate these dangerous emissions. Second, advocating for policy changes that regulate and phase out harmful substances, while encouraging the innovation of sustainable technologies, is essential.Lastly, collective action is vital in addressing this global concern. Through grassroots movements, communities can unite to promote environmental sustainability, pushing for changes that not only preserve the ozone layer but also foster a healthier planet for future generations. In conclusion, the call to ""save the planet Earth"" is more than just a slogan; it is a clarion call for collective responsibility in the face of escalating environmental challenges. Our actions today will determine the Earth's future, and it is our duty to safeguard it."
107;Some people believe that in order to give opportunities to new generations, companies should encourage high level employees who are older than 55 to retire. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy. Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young, others claim that this is not the case.Admittedly, encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits. Firstly, fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation. This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities. Secondly, having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency. Compared with aged staffs, younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline.However, sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences. From personal level, it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations. It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it, disregard the age and physical capacity. From social perspective, massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government. For example, sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently.In conclusion, even though the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits, it is convincing that it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly.;Title: The Consequences of Sacrificing Senior Members to Protect Young WorkersThe notion of sacrificing senior members of the workforce to preserve job opportunities for younger workers may seem appealing at first glance, but it harbors several detrimental consequences. Not only does it harm the dynamics of the workplace, but it also creates a pervasive sense of unfairness between generations, ultimately impacting societal cohesion.On a personal level, forcing senior employees into early retirement generates feelings of resentment and inequity among workers. Older employees often have invaluable experience and institutional knowledge that younger workers cannot easily acquire. When organizations prioritize the younger workforce by ousting their experienced counterparts, a message is inadvertently conveyed: longevity and expertise are undervalued. This generational divide can lead to a toxic work environment, where older employees feel sidelined and disheartened. Such feelings of being disposable can severely affect their mental and emotional well-being, fostering distrust and disharmony among colleagues.Moreover, massive layoffs and forced early retirements of senior workers can impose a significant financial burden on local governments and communities. Many older employees rely on pensions and retirement benefits that are directly tied to their years of service. Should a large number of these employees suddenly retire, the economic consequences would ripple through the community. Increased unemployment rates might lead to higher demand for social services and financial assistance programs, putting further strain on local budgets. In the long run, the financial liabilities associated with supporting displaced senior workers could outweigh any short-term gains from providing opportunities to younger individuals.In conclusion, while the idea of addressing youth unemployment by sacrificing senior members may seem pragmatic, its negative implications are far-reaching. Rather than fostering intergenerational conflict and economic strain, organizations should seek to implement more inclusive strategies that value the contributions of both young and older employees, preserving harmony and stability within the workforce.
108;Some people believe that the media, such as the press, TV and internet should be more strictly controlled. Others feel that controls should be loosened to give people freer access to information. Which opinion do you agree with?;Nowadays, one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers, televisions and websites. It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public. However, I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures.One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content. They have a serious impact on people in their puberty. For example, an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off. Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture. A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser. This is actually very environmentally unfriendly.The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens. In other words, the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner, especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases. Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example, the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths. Even so, another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest.Both sides of the arguments have its merits. My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety, the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information. Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea.;The role of mass media in shaping public opinion is a topic steeped in controversy, particularly regarding the extent of control imposed on newspapers, television, and online content. Proponents of tighter media regulation argue that such measures are essential for curbing the dissemination of violent and sexual content that can negatively influence audiences, especially impressionable children. This perspective holds that without stricter controls, the prevalence of graphic imagery and crude depictions can desensitize viewers and normalize unacceptable behaviors, potentially leading to increased aggression and unhealthy views on relationships.Additionally, the importation of foreign television programs presents another compelling argument for media regulation. Audiences can be significantly influenced by the norms and values depicted in these international shows. Foreign programming may sometimes include ideologies or practices that conflict with local values, leading to cultural shifts that some fear could threaten societal integrity. Advocates for tighter controls argue that by regulating what content can be broadcast or displayed, countries can better shield their citizens from ideas that may be harmful or conflicting with established societal norms.On the other hand, opponents of strict media control emphasize the necessity of preserving freedom of expression. They argue that censorship can infringe upon civil liberties and that citizens have the right to access a wide array of viewpoints and content, even if some of it is controversial or challenging. This viewpoint posits that engagement with diverse ideas and narratives is crucial for a vibrant democracy, allowing for personal and societal growth. The tension between protecting societal values and ensuring freedom of expression remains a dominant theme in the discourse surrounding media control. As society navigates this complex landscape, it becomes increasingly important to find a balance that respects both the need for regulation and the fundamental right to freedom of speech.
109;Some people think that paying taxes is enough to contribute to the society. Others argue that being a citizen involves more responsibilities. Discuss, what is your opinion?;There is a controversial debate around the world about the duties of citizen. Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens, while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities.Taxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries. If people are paying taxes, that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country's economy. Therefore, they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen.Some people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax. In fact, in order to develop a country, citizens must obey laws, which were imposed by the government. In this way, the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place, so the country will develop at a rapid pace. Furthermore, being a citizen in society should protect the country's culture and history. For instance, people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books. On the other hand, a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation. Indeed, if people in society have a strong bond with each other, society will become a peaceful place, where people are helping and sharing to each other.Taking everything into account, I strongly believe that being a citizen involves in a number of duties, other than paying taxes. People in society must do more than paying taxes to contribute to their society.;The debate surrounding the responsibilities of citizens often highlights contrasting perspectives on the role of taxation in societal obligation. While some individuals assert that paying taxes is the sole responsibility of citizens, others argue that true citizenship encompasses a broader spectrum of duties. To foster the development of a country, citizens must actively engage in various responsibilities beyond mere financial contributions.One fundamental duty of citizens is to obey the laws established by the government. These laws are designed to maintain order, ensure justice, and protect the rights of individuals within society. By adhering to these regulations, citizens contribute to the stability of their communities and the nation as a whole. This adherence not only facilitates the smooth functioning of society but also reinforces the social contract between the government and its citizens, fostering trust and collaboration.Moreover, citizens have a vital responsibility to preserve and protect their country’s culture and history. Cultural heritage is a critical component of national identity, and it is the duty of citizens to celebrate and safeguard it for future generations. This involves participating in cultural events, supporting local traditions, and educating others about the importance of heritage. By doing so, citizens reinforce a sense of unity and belonging within the community, which is essential for fostering national pride and cohesion.In conclusion, while paying taxes is undeniably a vital aspect of civic duty, it is not the only responsibility of citizens. To cultivate a thriving society, individuals must also obey laws and actively engage in the preservation of their country's cultural and historical identity. Ultimately, it is through the fulfillment of these diverse responsibilities that citizens can contribute meaningfully to the growth and development of their nation.
110;Testing on animals should be made illegal. Agree or disagree?;Perhaps the most serious problem facing the animals' rights today is animal experimentation. Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing, including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health, I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings.There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned. Firstly, the costs outweigh the benefits. Every year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result. Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money, since they must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances.Secondly, animals are kept in unnatural conditions. Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs. In March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head. Consequently, I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity.There is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals. Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading, since animals and people's response to a drug can be different. I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual.For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result and consequently, it should be made illegal.;Animal testing has long been a controversial practice in the field of medical research. While it is true that many significant medical treatments, including drugs for cancer and HIV, have been discovered through animal testing, the ethical implications and scientific limitations of this practice raise serious concerns. There are several compelling reasons to advocate for the banning of animal testing.Firstly, the costs associated with animal testing often outweigh the benefits. While some breakthroughs have been made, the reliability of results obtained from animal models is frequently questioned. Animals do not always correlate perfectly with human physiology, leading to discrepancies in drug efficacy and safety outcomes. For instance, a drug that appears effective in animal studies may fail during human trials, as seen in several high-profile cases. This not only wastes valuable resources but also delays the availability of potentially life-saving treatments for human patients.Secondly, the conditions in which animals are kept during testing are significantly unnatural and often detrimental to their welfare. Many of these animals are housed in cramped cages, deprived of social interactions, and subjected to stressful environments. This not only causes physical harm but also psychological distress. The ethical treatment of sentient beings must be a priority, and it is troubling to continue a practice that compromises their well-being for human gain.Additionally, as advancements in technology unveil alternative methods for research, such as in vitro testing and computer modeling, it becomes increasingly clear that there are viable alternatives to animal testing. These methods can provide more accurate and humane solutions for studying human diseases, thus making animal testing an outdated and unnecessary practice.In conclusion, while animal testing has played a role in some medical advancements, the ethical and scientific challenges it poses render it a practice that should be banned. There are better, more humane ways to conduct research that do not compromise the welfare of animals or the integrity of scientific findings. 
111;"Many people believe that formal ""pen and paper"" examinations are not the best method of assessing educational achievement. What is your view of examinations?Ê";"Examinations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world. At virtually every stage of the learning process, exams are used to verify that the learner is ready to move on to the next stage. However, many believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered.There are clearly advantages to exams. They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates. They are also relatively versatile; different types of exam questions, for example, multiple-choice questions and essay tasks, can test different sorts of reasoning ability. However, exams also have some drawbacks. Test-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills. In contrast, some test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety. In this case, teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested, thus narrowing the educational experience for all.A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns. Wherever possible, exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment. Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills. Other types of assessment should also be considered, assignment writing, for example, to assess independent learning and research skills, or group projects, to measure teamwork ability.In conclusion, it is convincing that exams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement. However, exams need to be carefully designed and supplemented with other forms of evaluation if they are to be a truly useful component of the education system.";Examinations have long been a fundamental component of education systems worldwide, serving as a primary means of assessing student learning and academic achievement. While they provide several advantages, including fairness and standardization, there is a growing belief among educators and researchers that the role of examinations should be re-evaluated in light of their limitations.One of the most significant benefits of examinations is that they create a level playing field for all students. By imposing the same test conditions on every candidate, exams ensure that all students are evaluated using the same criteria, which cultivates a sense of fairness. This uniformity helps to mitigate biases that might arise from varied teaching methods, socioeconomic backgrounds, or personal circumstances, thereby offering a more equitable assessment of students' abilities and knowledge.Moreover, examinations motivate students to consolidate their learning and manage their time effectively, as they often require intense preparation and review. This pressure can encourage a deeper engagement with the material, leading to better retention and understanding. For many students, the exam serves as a capstone experience, synthesizing months of learning into a singular demonstration of their capabilities.However, as education evolves, critics argue that reliance on exams may not reflect a comprehensive understanding of a student's abilities. Traditional examinations primarily measure rote memorization rather than critical thinking, creativity, or practical application of knowledge. Furthermore, they can induce significant stress and anxiety, which may hinder performance and negatively impact students' mental health.In conclusion, while examinations provide advantages, including fairness and structured assessment, it is essential to reconsider their role within our education systems. A balanced approach that includes a variety of assessment methods could offer a more holistic understanding of students' learning achievements, fostering an environment that nurtures not only academic success but also personal growth and well-being.
112;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. However, the governments of richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in such areas.;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries.Firstly, in the area of health, poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations. High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident. On top of that, poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients. To solve these issues, richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals.Secondly, in the area of education, it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions. Besides that, education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it. In order to solve the education manpower problem, richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries. Meanwhile, for the issue of education fee, richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students.Lastly, in the area of trade, no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money. Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure. For example, residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production. As a token of goodwill, richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading. The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading.In conclusion, richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health, education and trade. Improvements in these areas will create a better life for residents in poorer nations which they can use to grow their homeland.;The development of poorer nations hinges significantly on key sectors such as health, education, and trade. These components act as fundamental building blocks that foster sustainable growth and elevate the living standards of communities. Richer nations have a pivotal role to play in facilitating this development, particularly through the delegation of healthcare professionals and the provision of financial support for educational advancements.Health is paramount in the development process. Without adequate healthcare, populations are susceptible to diseases that can diminish productivity and derail economic progress. Richer nations can contribute by sending qualified doctors and nurses to poorer regions, alleviating the burden on local healthcare systems. These professionals can help manage existing health crises, implement preventive measures, and train local staff, ensuring the longevity and sustainability of health improvements. In addition to human resources, financial contributions towards constructing hospitals and clinics can further bolster health infrastructure, enabling broader access to quality medical care.Education serves as a powerful catalyst for societal advancement. By offering scholarships and low-interest loans to qualified students in poorer nations, wealthier countries can invest in the potential of future leaders and innovators. Access to education not only enables individuals to escape the cycle of poverty but also equips entire communities with the knowledge and skills necessary for economic development. As these educated individuals contribute to their societies, the reciprocal relationship between education and economic growth becomes evident.Moreover, fostering trade relationships between richer and poorer nations can create mutual benefits. By accessing broader markets, poorer nations can export their goods and services, enhancing their economic viability. This economic interdependence harnesses the strengths of both sides, promoting global stability and prosperity. In conclusion, the collaboration between richer and poorer nations in health, education, and trade is essential for the development of underprivileged areas. Through shared resources and opportunities, a more equitable and prosperous world can be achieved, ensuring that no nation is left behind in the pursuit of progress.
113;As computers are being used more and more in education, there will be soon no role for teachers in the classroom. Agree or disagree.;In recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process. However, I do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers.There are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers. Firstly, computers need to be operated by people. No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today. For example, lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector. However, scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching. I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers, but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch.Secondly, children need human interactions. No matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils. As a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education. Without someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn'. I am inclined to agree with this scientific view, because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model.In conclusion, there can be no school without a teacher. I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place. Teachers are not just teachers, they are also friends and conseilieurs.;"Teachers play a multifaceted role in the lives of their students, transcending the traditional boundaries of education. They are not merely figures imparting knowledge from textbooks; they function as friends, mentors, and counselors. This human connection is essential in the development of a student's emotional and psychological well-being, and it is something that a computer, regardless of its sophistication, will never be able to replicate.At their core, teachers cultivate an environment of trust and support. They understand the unique challenges their students face, not only academically but also personally. A teacher’s empathy allows them to connect with students on various levels, providing a safe space for sharing thoughts, worries, and aspirations. This relationship is invaluable, as it fosters a sense of belonging and inclusion within the educational setting. While technology can deliver information, it lacks the emotional intelligence necessary to form genuine bonds with students.Moreover, teachers serve as role models, embodying values and qualities that students aspire to. Through their actions and guidance, they instill important life lessons about perseverance, integrity, and responsibility. A computer, no matter how advanced, cannot demonstrate these virtues or inspire students in the same way a dedicated teacher can. Personal anecdotes and experiences shared by teachers resonate with students, illustrating that success involves overcoming obstacles. Additionally, teachers often act as counselors, helping students navigate the complexities of their lives and decisions. They are attuned to the nuances of human emotion, often spotting when a student is struggling or in need of guidance. Computers lack this crucial ability to read emotions and provide tailored support.In conclusion, while technology occupies an increasingly significant role in education, it will never replace the invaluable contributions of teachers. They are not just educators; they are friends, mentors, and essential guides in the journey of personal and academic growth."
114;Food can be produced cheaper if we use improved fertilisers and better machinery. However some of methods may be dangerous for human health, and have negative effects for local communities. What is your opinion?;In recent years, the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy. While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products, others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people's health condition and the society.Admittedly, applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers' economic profit. This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops, and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest. Consequently, the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased.However, high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals' health well-being. Unlike the organic plant foods, industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals, which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently. In this case, consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future.Moreover, excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society. One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission. In contrast, manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages. For another, mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry, possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields.In conclusion, even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers, it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked.;The integration of advanced plant foods with newly developed devices has revolutionized agricultural practices, offering significant reductions in the cost of producing farm products. Modern technology, such as precision farming tools, sensors, and automated irrigation systems, allows farmers to optimize crop yields while minimizing labor expenses. These innovations enhance efficiency, reduce waste, and ultimately lead to lower prices for consumers. As a result, food security is improved, and the agricultural sector can become more sustainable.However, the rise of high-tech fertilizers and inputs raises concerns regarding individual health and well-being. While these fertilizers can enhance plant growth, they may also introduce harmful chemicals into the environment. Prolonged exposure to synthetic fertilizers has been linked to various health issues, including respiratory problems and other ailments. There is an ongoing debate about the long-term effects of these substances on human health, suggesting that a cautious approach to their use is warranted. Moreover, excessive reliance on electronic equipment for harvest can lead to significant societal impacts. While automation can streamline agricultural processes, it may also contribute to job losses in rural communities. As machines take over tasks traditionally performed by humans, agricultural workers may find themselves displaced, leading to increased unemployment and economic challenges. This shift may widen the social divide, as those lacking skills in technology face difficulties in adapting to the new job landscape.In conclusion, while advanced plant foods and innovative equipment have undeniably transformed farming efficiency and cost-effectiveness, there exist serious implications. Ensuring public health concerning high-tech fertilizers must remain a priority, and addressing the socio-economic impacts of automation is crucial. A balanced approach that harnesses the benefits while mitigating risks will be essential for the future of agriculture and society.
115;Some people think that government should spend money on other important subjects rather helping artists. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country, every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely. Therefore, there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists, but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space. In my view, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons.The main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists. For example, monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists. In fact, some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue, thus, the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry.In addition, sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation. Therefore, culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art. Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts.Another reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted. Indeed, not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts. Hence, this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature.To sum up, art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere, so I think governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work.;"The ongoing debate over government funding for the arts has garnered significant attention, with suggestions that such financial support should be cut. However, I firmly disagree with this recommendation for several compelling reasons. Art not only enhances the quality of our lives but also plays an essential role in attracting tourism, contributing substantially to local economies.First and foremost, art enriches our daily experiences. It serves as a vital medium for expression, enabling individuals to communicate emotions, ideas, and cultural narratives. From paintings to music, theater, and literature, artistic endeavors inspire creativity and critical thinking, which are fundamental in fostering a vibrant society. Studies have shown that exposure to art can improve mental well-being, promote social cohesion, and enhance community pride. By supporting artists, governments promote a culture that values creativity and innovation, which are crucial for societal progress.Moreover, the arts are a powerful economic driver. Cultural tourism, in particular, has a remarkable impact on local economies. Tourists are often drawn to regions known for their artistic heritage—museums, galleries, music festivals, and other cultural events attract millions of visitors annually. These events boost local businesses, from hotels and restaurants to retail shops, creating jobs and stimulating economic growth. Artists and cultural organizations often depend on government funding to sustain their work; without this support, many may struggle to survive or innovate, ultimately diminishing the appeal of our cities and regions.In conclusion, cutting government funding for the arts would not only have detrimental effects on cultural expression and community well-being but would also undermine the economic benefits that a thriving arts scene brings. Investing in the arts is an investment in our quality of life, and it enriches both individuals and communities alike. Thus, I believe governments should continue to support artists and cultural initiatives wholeheartedly."
116;Development in technology causes environmental problems. Some people believe the solution in these problems is everyone accepts a simpler way of life, while others say that technology can solve these problems. Discuss both view and give your own opinion.Ê;It is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems. Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems. In the following paragraphs, I intend to discuss both viewpoints.Some people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment. They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment. If people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment.On the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment. They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back. We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart.There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot. One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa. By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030. By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions. If successful, the impact on the world would be monumental. It would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes. It would mean another industrial revolution.To put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, technology alone can solve the world's environmental problems. We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place. It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life.;The debate surrounding the relationship between technology and the environment has become increasingly pertinent in recent years. On one hand, some argue that to truly save our planet, humanity must abandon modern technology and return to simpler ways of living, often romanticizing an era before industrialization. Proponents of this viewpoint insist that reducing our reliance on gadgets, fossil fuels, and mass production could limit pollution and restore ecosystems, allowing nature to flourish without human interference. They believe that a more sustainable lifestyle can facilitate a more harmonious relationship with the environment, promoting practices like local farming and conservation.Conversely, an increasingly vocal faction asserts that technology holds the key to resolving the very environmental crises we face. Innovations in engineering, renewable energy, and sustainable practices have the potential to greatly reduce our ecological footprint. For instance, advancements in solar and wind energy have led to cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels, significantly lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, technologies like smart agriculture can optimize resource use, reducing waste and promoting food security. Supporters of this view highlight how cutting-edge environmental tech, such as carbon capture and green building materials, are paving the way toward a more sustainable future.As we move forward, striking a balance between these two perspectives may prove essential. Acknowledging the need for simplistic living while embracing technological innovations might offer a comprehensive approach to environmental stewardship. Rather than seeing technology and simplicity as opposing forces, we can view them as complementary paths toward sustainability. Investing in eco-friendly technologies while fostering a societal shift toward mindful consumption can create a symbiotic relationship, thus not only preserving the planet but also improving the quality of life for all its inhabitants. Ultimately, the solution lies in harnessing the best aspects of both ideologies to create a healthier, more sustainable future.
117;Professional athletes (such as football stars) and entertainers (such as singers and actors) are paid too much money for the work they do. Use specific details and examples to support your answer. ;Some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year. However, that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society. I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social, economic fields.First of all, some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own. For example, hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship. They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training, let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves. In addition, although there are many singers and athletes, few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately. Overcoming all these obstacles, they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts. However, their talents should not be overrated. Other people say that singers and athletes, in fact, contribute insignificantly to the development of the society. It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms. While scientists invent machines serving daily lives, doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation, singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life. They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience. Indeed, their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists, albeit necessary. Hence, their privilege of salary seems groundless, while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities.From all analysis suggested above, professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions. I think that there should be a modification in the salary of professional singers and athletes to balance with those of people in other fields, namely science and society, who are the driving forces for the prosperity of the nation.;The debate surrounding the salaries of professional athletes and entertainers is a polarizing topic that evokes varied opinions. On one hand, many believe that the substantial incomes — often reaching millions of dollars each year — are justifiable. They argue that these individuals possess exceptional talents and skills that are not commonly found. Athletes, for instance, dedicate years of rigorous training and sacrifice to hone their craft, showcasing extraordinary physical abilities that entertain millions. Similarly, entertainers and musicians often possess unique creative talents that resonate with people across cultures, bringing joy and inspiration to countless fans.However, this perspective raises an essential question: do these impressive abilities and the entertainment they provide equate to a significant contribution to society? Critics argue that the inflated salaries of athletes and entertainers do not reflect the broader societal value of their contributions. Unlike doctors, teachers, or first responders, who are essential to public health and education, the work of athletes and entertainers may be seen as less critical for societal development. While they do play a role in promoting physical fitness, mental well-being, and cultural enrichment, the argument persists that their financial rewards are disproportionate to these benefits.Furthermore, the economic dynamics of the sports and entertainment industries complicate the situation. High salaries are often justified by large revenues generated from viewership, ticket sales, and merchandise. However, this raises concerns about prioritizing entertainment over more pressing social needs, such as healthcare and education.In conclusion, while professional athletes and entertainers undeniably possess exceptional talents and provide enjoyment to the masses, their astronomical salaries prompt an important discussion about societal values and priorities. The debate continues as society grapples with the notion of meritocracy and the definition of contributions that truly enhance our communal life.
118;Some people think that computers and the Internet are more important for a child's education than going to school. But others believe that schools and teachers are essential for children to learn effectively. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;With the number of technological advances growing apace, it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future. This idea may point out to two main directions, both of which present different arguments.Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information, which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate. Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge, ranging from visual to aural stimuli, which make learning an ever enjoyable experience, especially for children.On the other hand, critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable, there still remain certain shortcomings. Much information as the Internet may provide, most of the sources are unjustified by experts. As a result, information from those sources is subject to question. Admittedly, the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can. Through face-to-face communication, teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore, adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students. This is where the computer proves to be incompetent.In short, although both sides have their equally valid arguments, I am inclined to think that although Internet can be a useful tool for education, at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced.;"The debate surrounding the potential of the Internet and computers to replace traditional teachers has gained significant traction in recent years. Proponents of this perspective argue that the vast expanse of the global online network serves as an inexhaustible source of information, making education more accessible than ever before. With just a few clicks, students can access a plethora of resources, from academic journals to instructional videos, fostering an environment that encourages independent learning. As a result, one can argue that technology equips students with the ability to explore subjects at their own pace and provides personalized pathways tailored to individual needs.However, critics of this viewpoint caution against over-reliance on technology, highlighting the significant shortcomings that existing digital platforms may have in fulfilling the nuanced role of teachers. While the Internet undoubtedly offers considerable educational benefits, such as diverse learning materials and interactive content, it lacks the human element intrinsic to effective teaching. Teachers do not merely deliver content; they inspire, mentor, and support students emotionally. The ability to read a classroom, adapt to varied learning styles, and foster a sense of belonging cannot be replicated by machines or digital content. Furthermore, the overwhelming amount of information available online may lead to confusion or misinformation, particularly for young learners who require guidance in discerning credible sources.In conclusion, while the Internet and computers present exciting opportunities for augmenting education, they cannot wholly replace the traditional role of teachers. The indispensable qualities of empathy, motivation, and adaptability that educators bring to the learning environment are irreplaceable. Therefore, a balanced approach that leverages technology while preserving the invaluable contributions of teachers may be the key to shaping future educational landscapes."
119;Capital punishment (the death penalty) is necessary in order to control the amount of violent crimes in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries. In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred, it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence. However, as the society grows, human rights become more highly respected, ""murdering"" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept.First of all, it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life. Although what criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, they are humans and their lives need to be valued. In addition, execution does not resolve the consequences of crime, not to mention it could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled.Secondly, capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives. Moreover, in terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away.The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted. Juries are also humans, they may lack of discretion. Thus, many people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system.In conclusion, although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community, I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane. Furthermore, it can be replaced by a life sentence.";Capital punishment remains one of the most contentious issues in contemporary society, with heated debates echoing across various nations. Proponents argue that in a world plagued by brutal crimes, the death penalty serves as a necessary deterrent against heinous acts and offers a form of retribution that underscores the gravity of violent offenses. The belief is rooted in the idea that certain crimes are so egregious that they merit the ultimate penalty—that of life itself. By imposing capital punishment, advocates assert that society can express its condemnation of such acts, potentially preventing future violence and reinforcing the sanctity of life for those who choose to respect societal laws.However, the moral implications of capital punishment become increasingly challenging as society evolves and human rights gain prominence. The notion of “murdering” an individual—regardless of their crimes—sparks discomfort and ethical quandaries among many. Critics argue that capital punishment contravenes the fundamental belief in the sanctity of human life, suggesting that a civilized society should not stoop to the level of taking a life, even if it is in reprisal for an unspeakable act. The risk of wrongful convictions further complicates the debate, highlighting the fallibility of the judicial system and raising questions about the irreversible nature of such punishment.Moreover, as countries grow more aware of human rights, many are beginning to abolish the death penalty, viewing it as an archaic and inhumane practice. The arguments against capital punishment, rooted in morality and the potential for judicial error, reflect a societal shift towards valuing rehabilitation over retribution. This evolving perspective invites a reevaluation of how justice is pursued, suggesting that in the long run, a system that fosters rehabilitation may lead to a safer and more humane society than one reliant on the death penalty. Ultimately, the debate over capital punishment requires a careful balancing act between the pursuit of justice, the protection of society, and an unwavering commitment to human rights.
120;Businesses should do anything they can to make a profit. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;There is no doubt that companies, factories and businesses establish to provide products which are people's need and make a profit for their managers. However, I completely disagree with the idea that businesses should be allowed to do anything they want to make a profit. With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit.Firstly, if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want, they will threaten the beings' life such as human, animals and plants. As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances.Moreover, if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit, they will produce products with low qualities and high prices, therefore they might hit consumer's life. For instance, a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk, sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die.In conclusion, all companies, factories and businesses should be monitored by governments and executive, and they do not have to let do anything they want just due to making profit. They can hit both the environment and human's life easily.;In the modern economy, businesses, factories, and corporations play a vital role by producing goods and services that cater to human needs while generating profits for their shareholders and managers. This symbiotic relationship between profit and provision is foundational to our markets. However, without effective regulation and oversight, the unchecked operation of these entities poses significant risks to the environment and society at large. The absence of stringent controls can lead to a range of dangerous consequences, not just for consumers but for all living beings that share our planet. Businesses driven solely by profit motives may prioritize cost-cutting over quality, resulting in products that are substandard and potentially harmful. For example, in the rush to minimize costs, some companies may utilize cheaper materials that compromise safety or are detrimental to health. This irresponsibility can endanger consumers and contribute to broader public health crises.Moreover, the unregulated exploitation of natural resources can have dire repercussions for our ecosystems. Factories might discharge pollutants into water bodies, thereby threatening aquatic life and the biodiversity that supports it. As they expand, businesses may also encroach upon habitats crucial for wildlife, leading to species extinction and a loss of biodiversity. Additionally, unregulated industries can create an economic landscape characterized by high prices for low-quality goods. When competition is stifled due to monopolistic practices or lack of oversight, consumers are left with few choices and ultimately pay the price. High prices for inferior products can drive families to make unhealthy or unsustainable purchasing decisions.In conclusion, while companies are vital for delivering necessary products and services, it is crucial to implement robust regulations to ensure they operate responsibly. Without oversight, businesses can endanger human health, threaten animal populations, and disrupt ecosystems, ultimately jeopardizing the very fabric of life on Earth. Balancing profit with ethical responsibility should be the cornerstone of modern business practices.
121;It is recently announced that a new high school may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan?;Although some of my neighbors will oppose this idea, personally I approve it. The new high school will bring a lot of advantages to my community. The high school of my district is pretty old and lacks in necessities for students, so they can't get enough education. I really believe that new high school is a great addition to the educational system of my community.	Firstly, I think that the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education. Their old high school is pretty old and need in new educational materials, repairing of the place for sport activities. Also the laboratory of physics and chemistry was in bad condition, so the students can't study well during the classes. They will study with new breath and great enthusiasm in new school. Secondly, the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city. After classes students and not only the students will get together in building of high school, participate in different competitions. For instance during the football match the students of different high schools will come and after the competition they will keep in touch. This will increase the social connections of the students. The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions. The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed, but I think this isn't a important reason for ceasing the competitions. To sum up, this new construction has a lot of advantages like new connections between students from different communities, also the new educational equipment will increase the students' enthusiasm toward studying. The only disadvantage is the nosiness of competitions which students will participate, but I think that it isn't a big deal. So the new high school will be a great addition for my environment.;"High schools play a crucial role in shaping the future of our youth, serving as educational institutions and community hubs. Unfortunately, the current high school in my district has become outdated, struggling to meet the necessities of today’s students. It lacks modern facilities, technology, and resources that are essential for a comprehensive educational experience. This has hindered the potential for students to thrive academically and socially, limiting opportunities for engagement and connection between peers.However, the forthcoming construction of a new high school presents an exciting opportunity for transformation. This new facility promises to be more than just a building; it aims to foster an environment where students from different communities and districts can come together, collaborate, and build meaningful relationships. With its state-of-the-art classrooms, advanced technology, and flexible spaces designed for group activities, the new high school will facilitate improved interactions among students. One of the most significant advantages of the new high school will be its potential to bridge diverse communities. The current school has often been a reflection of its limitations, where students from different backgrounds rarely engage with one another. The new environment will encourage inclusivity and promote multicultural dialogues, allowing students to learn from each other's experiences and perspectives. Such interactions can cultivate empathy, understanding, and respect, which are vital qualities in today’s global society.Furthermore, the new high school will likely offer a range of extracurricular activities and programs that can attract a broader student population. This will not only enhance the social fabric of the school but also lead to increased collaboration on projects, teams, and events, ultimately strengthening the community as a whole.In conclusion, the new high school presents a pivotal moment for my district. It holds the promise of rejuvenating the educational experience while serving as a catalyst for connection among students from various backgrounds, thereby nurturing a generation that values diversity and cooperation."
122;Parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their older (15 - 18 year old) teenaged children. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It might seem that teenaged children particularly in age of 15 - 18 are fully grown, so they do not need any help for making important decisions. However, in my opinion, teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages. I will discuss my view in two main areas.In the first place, there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children, therefore they are the best advisor for their children. They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life, so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things. Also, they can save value things in their life such as time and money, and enjoy they life with the best way.Moreover, I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers, because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money. They cheat young ages because they believe they are immature and they can trap them easily.To sum up, it makes no difference, people from young ages to old ages are free to make a decision, nonetheless sometimes to prevent some problems coming up for young individuals , it is a good idea to ask parents and adult relatives to give a piece of advice.;Teenagers stand at a critical crossroads in their lives, navigating the turbulent waters of adolescence. This period is often marked by emotional upheaval, social challenges, and a quest for identity. Therefore, it is imperative that teenagers receive more attention and help compared to older individuals. Unlike adults who have often established stability in their lives, teenagers are still forming their values, beliefs, and life skills. This is where the guidance of parents and adult relatives becomes invaluable.Parents and older family members possess a wealth of experience and insights that can guide teenagers through the complexities of growing up. Their lived experiences enable them to offer practical advice that can help teenagers avoid common pitfalls. For example, they can impart wisdom on managing relationships, navigating academic pressures, and making responsible choices. Empathetic and understanding, they can help teenagers process their emotions and develop resilience in the face of adversity.Furthermore, parental guidance can help adolescents save significant time and money. When teenagers are faced with decisions about education, careers, and investments, having someone with experience to provide advice can help them avoid costly mistakes. This guidance can translate to better choices regarding higher education, job opportunities, and financial management, laying a strong foundation for their future.In addition to these tangible benefits, the emotional support provided by parents and older relatives fosters a sense of security that is crucial during this developmental stage. When teenagers feel supported, they are more likely to thrive, both academically and socially. Thus, parents and adult relatives play an essential role in shaping not only the immediate well-being of their teenagers but also their long-term success. In conclusion, the need for greater attention and guidance for teenagers cannot be overstated, making the involvement of experienced adults vital during this formative stage.
123;Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;You hardly ever can find a person who says that he or she had unpleasant childhood. When individuals reminisce their memories they absolutely infer to some of their childhood events. As much as their events might were bitter, in their adulthood they are sweet. In my opinion, childhood is definitely the happiest time of people life in two main areas.In the first place, children are free whatever they want to do, they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare. Because they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs. Therefore there is no argument and punishment for them.In addition, in this age they are not expected to be responsible. Also, they do not have to educate and they do not have to work, so they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life. As a matter of fact, I made a large number of friends in this age, and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten. Also I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age.All in all, I would maintain that the best phase of people life is their childhood. They not only free to do whatever they want without any confine or punishment, but also they are free and have a lot of time in their hands to try and experience new things and enjoy them.;Childhood is often regarded as the happiest time in people's lives, and I wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment. There are two main areas that underscore the unique joy and freedom associated with this formative stage. First and foremost, children experience an unparalleled sense of freedom. They possess the remarkable ability to engage in activities of their choosing, unrestricted by the limitations that often accompany adult life. In their world, imagination reigns supreme, allowing them to explore fantastical realms and envision adventures without constraints. Whether it is building intricate forts from blankets, spending hours playing make-believe with friends, or discovering the wonders of nature, children indulge in experiences that foster creativity and joy. Unlike the responsibilities of adulthood, where time is measured by obligations and deadlines, childhood is characterized by a spontaneous and playful spirit, cultivating laughter and cherished memories.Furthermore, childhood is typically devoid of the burdens of education and employment that define adult life. While children do partake in learning, it is often a playful and engaging experience rather than a source of stress. They have abundant time at their disposal, allowing them to immerse themselves in the simple pleasures of life—playing outdoors, forming friendships, and exploring their interests. This abundance of time enables them to cultivate a sense of wonder and curiosity about the world around them, leading to joyful discoveries. In conclusion, childhood stands out as a unique period marked by freedom and abundant leisure. The lack of restrictions and responsibilities allows children to thrive in a world fueled by imagination and exploration, ultimately making it a truly joyous phase of life. For many, the memories of these carefree days linger long after they transition into adulthood, serving as a reminder of the pure happiness inherent in childhood.
124;People attend college and university for many reasons. Why do you think people attend college and university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your idea.;From many centuries ago, universities have been playing an important role in ones' life. Different people attend university for different point of views. In my perspective, the three most reasons are increased knowledge, career preparation and new experiences.First of all, for most people, university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding. Truthfully, in this wonderful academic environment, everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers. Thus, people are able to strengthen their knowledge. Moreover, through the instructions of teachers, the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory, library, students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect. Therefore, they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying.Secondly, studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life, which included many new experiences. The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous, more than any school one person have studied. Thus, students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation, even from the whole world. For instance, my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, etc. And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment, which is one of his main purposes when attending university. Last but not least, preparing for career is an essential function of university. Students not only do homework, assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work, internship and part time job. Thus, they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are. After all, they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives.In summation, people may attend university for various reasons. Some want to enjoy new experiences, some are going to prepare for their future career, while others are eager to develop their understanding. Even though the purposes could be various, everybody who is studying in university should concentrate on the objectives and try their best.;"University is often regarded as an ideal environment for individuals to expand their understanding of various subjects while also preparing for their future careers. This institution of higher learning provides students with the necessary resources, networks, and opportunities to delve deep into their chosen fields of study. However, the role of university extends beyond just academic pursuits; it is a multifaceted platform that equips students with the skills, experience, and knowledge required to excel in the professional world.To prepare for a successful career, students engage in a myriad of activities that complement their formal education. While completing homework, assignments, and attending lectures are fundamental components of university life, they are just the tip of the iceberg. Students are encouraged to participate actively in volunteer work and internships, which are crucial for gaining practical experience and real-world insights. Volunteer work fosters a sense of community engagement and social responsibility, helping students develop empathy and communication skills, while internships provide a direct glimpse into the day-to-day workings of their prospective professions.Moreover, these experiences allow students to apply theoretical knowledge to practical situations, enhancing their problem-solving abilities and critical thinking skills. Internships often lead to valuable networking opportunities, opening doors to future job prospects and career development. Additionally, engaging in extracurricular activities, such as clubs and organizations, enables students to build leadership skills, work collaboratively, and develop a well-rounded character.In conclusion, the university experience is vital for personal and professional growth. It prepares students not only academically but also equips them with the necessary soft skills and practical experience to thrive in their future careers. By engaging actively in their education through various opportunities, students can pave the way for successful and fulfilling lives beyond the classroom."
125;Do you agree or disagree? It's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.;There is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance. However, I still agree that it's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.We can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant. First, it's not easy to make friend with anyone. I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other. After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities, for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways. Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances. We spend time together but we could never be friend. So, it's much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends.Second, close friends can easily understand each others feelings. Because of the similarity I talked before, acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends. Moreover, they wouldn't even spare time to consider your feelings. Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time. Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend. When my friend is sick, I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible. If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail, I will try my best to pull him back, but not stand and stare like it's not of my business. And I believe my friend will do the same to me. In conclusion, a friend is a person you care about. To me, friends are the most important people in my life second to my family. I am the kind of person who has only one or two close friends, and I am fully content that I have such nice friends. If someone exchange my friends with thousands of acquaintances, I will definitely say NO.;In today’s increasingly interconnected world, the importance of social connections cannot be overstated. While having a wide circle of casual acquaintances can provide a sense of community and numerous networking opportunities, I strongly believe that the value of nurturing one or two deep friendships surpasses the benefits of maintaining a large number of superficial relationships. A close friend is someone who not only understands us but also cares deeply about our well-being. They are the individuals we can confide in during times of distress, celebrate milestones with, and seek advice from when navigating life's challenges. This emotional intimacy fosters a supportive environment, allowing us to be our authentic selves without fear of judgment. Unlike casual acquaintances, who may only engage with us based on external circumstances, a true friend willingly invests time and energy into the relationship, creating a bond that is both nurturing and fulfilling.Furthermore, a small circle of close friends can provide a sense of stability and safety that a large network of acquaintances does not. In times of crisis or personal struggle, it is the close friends who consistently show up with empathetic ears and helpful hands. They are the ones who will check in on us, offer encouragement, and remind us of our worth. This kind of support is invaluable and contributes to our overall mental and emotional health.In conclusion, while casual acquaintances may enhance our social lives and expand our horizons, it is the deep, meaningful connections with one or two close friends that truly enrich our existence. The quality of our friendships, rather than their quantity, ultimately shapes our experience of life and provides the emotional sustenance we need to thrive.
126;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"The life today is totally different from half centuries before. Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems; however it also deprives of some things that we had. In my opinion, life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons.The first reason is life is simple in the past. Nowadays, all humans compete together. Since world population getting higher, competition is getting fierce. If you are not able to handle your jobs, then someone will replace you right away. People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition. Therefore, lives in the old days is easier than today.Second, the environment today is serious damaged. Looking out the windows, what I see isn't sky, trees or mountains, but is coldly high buildings. Everyday, I walk on hard roads, breath in polluted air, and live in a limited space. What's worse, it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases. Thus, the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today.The third reason is that the pace of life. Today, we are able to read the news all over the world, to chat with people through the Internet, or to travel around the world by planes; however, it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life. If we cannot react properly and immediately, then we will be in a vulnerable situation. We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace.In conclusion, while there some people live in a pretty good condition, it is only a minority. People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology; nevertheless, behind the glamorous facade of it, what we loss will never be returned.";The life we lead today is worlds apart from what it was half a century ago. In my opinion, life in the old days brought more happiness to people for several reasons. Firstly, life was significantly simpler in the past. People were less burdened by the incessant demands of technology, social media, and the overwhelming influx of information. Relationships were often more personal and meaningful, as people engaged in face-to-face interactions, fostering a sense of community and belonging. The simplicity of daily life allowed individuals to savor the moment rather than be caught up in constant distractions.Secondly, the environment today is severely damaged. Industrialization and urbanization have taken a toll on our planet, leading to pollution, climate change, and the loss of natural habitats. In contrast, decades ago, people had a closer connection to nature and lived in a world where the environment was less polluted and more pristine. This natural beauty provided a backdrop for leisure and happiness, encouraging outdoor activities and a healthier lifestyle. The modern disconnection from nature may contribute to increasing stress and mental health issues, contrasting sharply with the more harmonious relationship people had with their surroundings in the past.Lastly, the pace of life has accelerated dramatically in recent years. The relentless pursuit of success, driven by endless work hours and societal pressures, leaves little room for relaxation or enjoyment. People today often find themselves racing against the clock, which diminishes opportunities for genuine happiness. In contrast, life fifty years ago allowed for more leisure time and a focus on enjoying the little things, such as family gatherings, shared meals, and simple pleasures that fostered joy and contentment.In conclusion, while modern life offers numerous conveniences and advancements, the simplicity, environmental connection, and slower pace of life in the past fostered a deeper sense of happiness and fulfillment among people.
127;High school should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Agree or disagree?;High school is the time when you decide your future career and particular field you want to concentrate and interested in. In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice, to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude.First of all, as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study. Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights. As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams.Next, students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades. Also, we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students. For example, when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other. Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit.Lastly, the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she/he has an aptitude. When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education. Furthermore, this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses.In conclusion, as a young women I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement so it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well. Having three reasons helps us to bring up students who are well-educated, with a bright and independent mind.;"High school is a pivotal stage in a student’s life, serving as the bridge between adolescence and adulthood. It is during these formative years that individuals often begin to contemplate their future careers and identify specific fields of interest. I firmly believe that high schools should permit students to choose their own courses for several compelling reasons: the freedom of choice, the enhancement of academic performance, and the opportunity for students to explore their aptitudes.Firstly, allowing students to choose their courses grants them a sense of autonomy and encourages personal responsibility. When students have the power to select subjects that resonate with their interests, they are more likely to engage deeply with the material. This freedom of choice can transform education from a mundane obligation into an exciting journey of self-discovery, fostering a lifelong love of learning.Secondly, when students are allowed to tailor their education to fit their passions, it often leads to improved grades and knowledge retention. A student who is genuinely interested in a subject is more inclined to invest time and effort into mastering it. This shift in motivation can create a positive feedback loop: as students achieve better grades, their confidence grows, further fueling their desire to learn. Consequently, engagement levels increase, resulting in a more dynamic and effective educational environment.Lastly, enabling students to explore various subjects helps them uncover their unique talents and aptitudes. High school is an essential time for self-exploration; different courses provide exposure to a range of skills and career options. Whether a student discovers a penchant for creative writing, a talent for mathematics, or an interest in the sciences, this exploration is invaluable in guiding their future educational and career choices.In conclusion, permitting students to choose their courses in high school is crucial for cultivating autonomy, enhancing academic performance, and helping individuals to discover and nurture their innate abilities. By embracing this approach, educational institutions can better prepare students for their future careers and empower them to carve their own paths in life."
128;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks, while others seem to prefer the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to live in a higher pace condition. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks, and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam. I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test. Therefore, we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy. If I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully. For instance, I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing. Hence, from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy. In contrast, it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I prefer to live in high pace. It is not to say, of course that other points of view are totally without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible.";In today’s fast-paced world, the debate between completing tasks with urgency versus taking a more measured approach is a prominent issue. Some individuals thrive on deadlines, driven by the urgency to accomplish their responsibilities swiftly, while others prefer a more leisurely pace, believing that this affords them the opportunity to engage deeply with their work. After contemplating this matter, I have developed my own perspective on the issue, emphasizing the benefits of a quicker approach to task completion.The first and foremost reason for my preference is the undeniable need to save time when tackling important tasks. In both professional and personal contexts, time is often of the essence. The ability to complete assignments efficiently can lead to better time management, allowing individuals to allocate their resources to other pressing matters. When I prioritize the timely completion of tasks, I find that I can set aside longer intervals for critical projects or responsibilities that require more focused attention later. This strategic planning can significantly enhance productivity and ensure that I am prepared for any unexpected challenges that may arise. Additionally, maintaining a high-paced work rhythm serves as a vital deterrent against laziness. When I maintain an efficient pace, I find that I am more engaged and less prone to procrastination. The adrenaline rush that comes from working under time constraints can foster creativity and innovation, as I am compelled to think quickly and maximize my potential. Conversely, a slower pace can sometimes lead to complacency and a lack of motivation, making it more challenging to maintain a consistent work ethic.In conclusion, while both approaches to task completion have their merits, I firmly believe that embracing a faster pace can lead to enhanced productivity and prevent the lethargy that often hinders progress. By efficiently managing time and engaging actively with tasks, one can achieve a balance that allows for both immediate success and long-term growth.
129;Tourism is a multibillion-dollar industry that supports economic development. However, some people think that it causes too much damage to the local environment and culture. What do you think?;Tourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy. Nevertheless, some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction, as a result of tourist activities, and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems. While both positions seem reasonable, my view is that, through proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas.The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region. This takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry. The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs. Furthermore, tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry. This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes. As a result, this gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return.Some people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism. In fact, compared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers. For instance, paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution. On the other hand, the dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated. It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so.After careful consideration of both sides of the argument, the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages. In conclusion, it is evident that under suitable administration, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks.;Tourism serves as a powerful engine for economic development, propelling growth in various sectors and providing invaluable opportunities for communities. Through the influx of visitors, regions can experience significant boosts in revenue generated from activities such as shopping, dining, and entertainment. In turn, this surge in economic activity translates to the creation of both direct and indirect jobs, enriching the local economy. The hospitality sector, including hotels and restaurants, benefits substantially, while retail businesses thrive from increased foot traffic. Moreover, the transportation industry sees growth through the need for taxis, buses, and tour services, creating additional job opportunities within the community.Agriculture can also reap the benefits of tourism. Local farms may supply fresh produce to restaurants and markets catering to tourists, fostering a symbiotic relationship that enhances local food security and promotes sustainable practices. The service industry—spanning from recreational services to tour guides—also flourishes alongside consumer demand, expanding employment possibilities in diverse areas.However, the emergence of tourism is not without its challenges. Critics argue that the rapid growth of the tourism sector can lead to environmental and cultural degradation. Popular destinations may suffer from overexploitation, resulting in ecosystem deterioration, loss of biodiversity, and increased waste. Additionally, local cultures may be commodified or diluted, as communities adapt to meet the expectations of tourists.Despite these valid concerns, it is crucial to recognize that tourism, when properly managed, can foster sustainable development practices. Communities can strike a balance by implementing regulations and promoting eco-friendly initiatives that preserve their natural and cultural assets. By embracing responsible tourism, regions can harness the economic benefits of tourism while safeguarding their environmental and cultural heritage for future generations. Ultimately, tourism has the potential to uplift economies, provided that its growth is accompanied by thoughtful strategies that prioritize sustainability.
130;The government should allocate more funds to public services instead of wasting money on arts such as music, painting and so on. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion;The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services, I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society.First of all, there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way. Admittedly, no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health, education, transportation and communication. However, these could only help individuals with their physical requirements. There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts.On top of this, the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society. No developed country could be named that music, painting, literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration. Enriching people's life and enlightening their thoughts, the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways.Furthermore, investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally. The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions. To sum up, not only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind, but also it would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways.;The issue of governmental financing for aesthetic features within society has ignited a contentious debate. On one side, critics argue that budget allocation to the arts constitutes a misallocation of finite national resources, which should instead be channeled into essential public services like healthcare, education, and infrastructure. They contend that in an era marked by pressing societal challenges, the focus should be on tangible outcomes that directly benefit citizens. However, I contend that investing in the arts is not only valid but crucial for the holistic development and well-being of a society.Firstly, allocating funds to the arts fosters cultural identity and community cohesion. Artistic endeavors, whether through public sculptures, theater productions, or local music festivals, contribute to a shared sense of belonging and pride. In diverse societies, the arts serve as a bridge, promoting understanding and appreciation among different cultural groups. This cultural enrichment strengthens social fabric, which is essential for harmonious living.Moreover, the arts can significantly boost the economy. Investing in aesthetic features stimulates local economies, creating jobs within the creative sector and attracting tourism. Public art installations can draw visitors, while cultural events can generate revenue for businesses, thereby enhancing community vitality. Additionally, arts education plays a pivotal role in fostering creativity and critical thinking skills in young people, preparing them for a rapidly changing job market.Furthermore, the presence of the arts has proven mental health benefits. Public art, community theaters, and music programs provide avenues for stress relief, self-expression, and community engagement. In times of societal turmoil, these outlets can foster resilience and hope, enhancing the overall quality of life.In conclusion, while the argument for prioritizing public services is compelling, the benefits of investing in the arts cannot be overlooked. Such investments yield not only immediate cultural and economic returns but also contribute to the long-term health and unity of society. Thus, it is imperative that governments recognize the arts not as superfluous expenditures, but as essential components of a thriving community.
131;The idea of having a single career is becoming an old fashioned one. The new fashion will be to have several careers or ways of earning money and further education will be something that continues throughout life.;"The career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century. People usually tend to have a single career as a means of living. However, a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security.A full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family. But with the recent recession, almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall. This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers. As a result, people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition.Moreover, the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment. The official term of it is named ""Technological Unemployment"". North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that, technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one. For example, robots, automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks, interpreters, security services, retails and specially in manufacturing companies. Thus many people's jobs are now at high stake. The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs. Last but not least, corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors.For the reasons mentioned above, I believe that people are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves.";In today’s rapidly evolving job market, new generations are redefining traditional notions of employment and financial security. Unlike past decades when a full-time job with a steady income was the primary goal for potential employees, the contemporary workforce is increasingly inclined towards multi-faceted career paths and diverse educational achievements. This shift is largely influenced by the ongoing economic uncertainty, especially following the recent recession that has affected countries globally.Historically, securing a stable job was viewed as a pathway to financial security, allowing individuals to support themselves and their families comfortably. However, the landscape has drastically transformed in light of economic challenges that have rendered conventional job security less reliable. With rising living costs, inflation, and job insecurity, new generations are compelled to rethink their approach to employment. They now pursue multiple jobs or side gigs simultaneously, seeking to maximize their income potential and mitigate the risks associated with a single-source income.Moreover, the quest for higher education has evolved. Young professionals recognize that holding just one degree may not equip them with the necessary skills to thrive in a competitive environment. As a result, they are increasingly focused on acquiring multiple certifications and skills, thereby enhancing their employability across various fields. This trend is fueled by the desire not only to earn more but also to remain adaptable in a job market characterized by rapid technological advancements and shifting industry demands.In essence, the economic landscape shaped by recent recessions has catalyzed a significant ideological shift among emerging generations. Their eagerness to perform various jobs and attain multiple higher educational qualifications signifies a proactive approach to achieving financial stability amid uncertainty. As the job market continues to evolve, this multi-dimensional strategy may well become the norm, redefining the future of employment for years to come.
132;Some people think that computers are more of a hindrance than a help in today's society. Others believe that they are such indispensable tools that they would not be able to live or work without them. Discuss both opinions and give your opinion;Computer is a modern device that is useful for human life. People use computer particularly for work, study, even for communication. However, many people argue that computer more give obstacle than a help in social life. Other sides believe that it becomes prominent thing, and they cannot do anything without that device. However, I strongly believe that computer can influence society, and people's lives have already been controlled by device. I would argue that this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people. A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to, due to the fact that they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working. As it can be seen from the example, the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected.However, using computer can make people easier to complete their work. Businessmen, for example, use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues. Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country. This is due to using computer more efficient and, many workers cannot do more in work without computer.In conclusion, in era technology like this age, computer becomes important thing in human life. Every day, people cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it. This situation becomes lifestyle habits, and nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use.;In today's digital age, the role of computers in shaping social interactions and influencing daily life cannot be overstated. While some individuals argue that computers create more obstacles than they offer assistance in social life, I firmly believe that these devices are instrumental in enhancing societal dynamics and transforming our interactions.Firstly, computers have revolutionized communication. Platforms such as social media, video conferencing, and instant messaging enable people to connect across vast distances, fostering relationships that may not have been possible otherwise. For instance, a person can engage with friends and family in different countries instantly, cultivating a sense of belonging despite geographical barriers. This connectivity facilitates the sharing of ideas and cultures, enriching personal experiences and social interactions.Moreover, computers play a pivotal role in information dissemination and access. The internet serves as an expansive repository of knowledge, allowing individuals to educate themselves and engage in discussions on various topics. This empowerment encourages informed decision-making and promotes social awareness. For example, individuals can access platforms that raise awareness about social issues, rallying community support and driving meaningful change.Critics may argue that reliance on computers can lead to social isolation, yet this viewpoint overlooks the ways computers foster new forms of community. Online gaming, forums, and social networks often create vibrant communities where individuals can form connections based on shared interests. These online environments can contribute positively to mental well-being by providing support networks and avenues for self-expression.In conclusion, while there may be challenges associated with the proliferation of computer technology, it is undeniable that these devices significantly influence society and enhance our lives. By facilitating communication, providing access to information, and fostering new communities, computers have become integral to modern social life. Therefore, rather than viewing them as obstacles, we should recognize the profound impact they have on shaping a more interconnected and informed society.
133;Some employers are giving increased importance to social skills. However, others still believe qualifications are the most important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Ê;With the increased educational level of workforce, there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process. However, some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion. The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion. Firstly, some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer. It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job. Specifically, people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience. Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery. On the other hand, it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers. It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently. Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other, especially when conflicts arise. Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way. Besides, organization have been transformed to customers oriented. Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction.To my view, I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs. Yet, the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others.;The evolving landscape of the job market has led to a shift in the criteria that employers consider when selecting candidates. Increasingly, many employers are prioritizing social skills alongside traditional qualifications in their hiring processes. Advocates of this approach argue that social skills are essential for fostering teamwork, communication, and a positive workplace culture. In an era where collaboration and adaptability are key to organizational success, employees who can effectively engage with colleagues and clients are invaluable. This emphasis on soft skills is particularly evident in fields that rely heavily on interpersonal interactions, such as healthcare and customer service.However, there remains a faction of employers who believe that qualifications should remain the foremost criterion in the recruitment process. For these employers, academic achievements, work experience, and technical skills serve as the foundation of a candidate's ability to perform specific job functions. They argue that without a solid educational background or relevant experience, an individual may struggle to meet the technical demands of the role, regardless of their social prowess. This viewpoint is particularly prevalent in fields where specialized knowledge is critical, such as engineering or medicine.In my opinion, while qualifications are undoubtedly important, neglecting social skills can be detrimental to a team’s dynamics and overall productivity. A candidate with a strong set of social skills is better equipped to navigate workplace challenges, build lasting relationships, and enhance team morale. Therefore, a balanced approach that values both qualifications and social skills can create a more holistic employee selection process. By recognizing the diverse attributes that contribute to a successful employee, employers can cultivate a workforce that not only excels in technical competencies but also thrives in a collaborative environment. Consequently, integrating both sets of criteria is essential for fostering comprehensive workplace effectiveness and innovation.
134;Some people believe that charities should give aid to those who need the aid most, wherever they live. Some people believe that charity organisations would better concentrate on people in their own countries instead. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;The world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters. Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people. However, it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located. My view is that international aid should be prioritised.International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems. Many people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards. They lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs. What is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members. It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support.Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders, it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens. After all, charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected. Another reason is that, even within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs. By solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth.In conclusion, people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary.;"International aid plays a vital role in addressing global disparities and alleviating human suffering. As we consider the dire situations faced by individuals in various parts of the world, especially in certain African countries, it becomes clear that our global community is facing much more serious problems than many of us can comprehend. In these regions, millions live below basic standards of living, lacking access to clean water, food security, healthcare, and education. This dire status not only undermines human potential but also contributes to wider issues such as political instability and forced migration.The act of providing international aid is thus not merely an act of charity; it is an ethical obligation to support those who are suffering through no fault of their own. Humanitarian efforts, whether through government initiatives or non-governmental organizations, aim to address these urgent needs and provide sustainable solutions. By investing resources and support into the development of these countries, we work towards building a more equitable global society.However, while it is crucial to extend a helping hand to those facing extreme challenges abroad, it is also reasonable to prioritize our fellow citizens. In many nations, individuals struggle with poverty, unemployment, and healthcare issues. These domestic challenges cannot be overlooked, as they also represent an important moral and social obligation. We must strike a balance between international assistance and supporting local needs to foster both national and global progress.In conclusion, international aid is essential in addressing the severe challenges faced by some populations. Yet, as we extend our compassion beyond borders, we must also remain attentive to the needs within our own countries. The goal should be to create a mutually beneficial relationship where aid flows in a way that uplifts all, fostering a spirit of solidarity and shared humanity."
135;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations, and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change. Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources, I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge.It is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students' acquisition of knowledge. Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields, and as the students answer these questions, the facts has been learned and reinforced. A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams, as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time. Moreover, when students have some academic problems, they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs. Besides, in the past, conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves, now all can be done at a click of a button. Thus, technologies are vital in students' learning.On the other hand, schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators. At schools, students' development has been orchestrated stage by stage, step by step by experienced teachers, and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way. Therefore, formal education approaches are also indispensable. To put it all in a nutshell, I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children's development. So students should learn both from their teachers as well as modern technology to gain the best learning outcome.;"The study habits of children today are radically different from those of previous generations, shaped significantly by the increased availability and relatively low prices of modern technology. In decades past, educational resources were limited primarily to textbooks and face-to-face interactions with teachers. However, the rise of the internet and portable technology, such as laptops and tablets, has transformed the learning landscape, making information readily accessible at any time and place.Modern students have an array of educational tools at their fingertips. Online platforms, multimedia resources, and interactive applications facilitate a learning experience that is not only engaging but also tailored to individual needs. This technological revolution allows children to supplement their education with alternative sources of knowledge, such as online courses, educational YouTube channels, and digital libraries. They no longer rely solely on assigned readings or classroom lectures; instead, they can pursue topics of interest with a few clicks, broadening their horizons in ways that were unimaginable just a generation ago.However, it's essential to recognize that while alternative sources have become increasingly significant, traditional teaching methods remain crucial in fostering a comprehensive educational foundation. Educators contribute invaluable guidance, expertise, and structured learning environments that encourage collaboration and critical thinking. Interaction with teachers provides the social aspect of learning that technology cannot replicate, as it cultivates essential skills such as communication and teamwork.Ultimately, the most effective approach to education today incorporates both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods. A balanced combination enables children to harness the advantages of modern technology while still benefiting from the stability and structure provided by educators. This synergy not only enhances knowledge acquisition but also prepares students for a world where adaptability and lifelong learning are key. As a result, today's learners are better equipped to navigate their future challenges than any generation before them."
136;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"A world sportive competition event is watched by almost every country around the world and provide social stimulus and people gathering. However, while people view these sportive events as vital in release international problems, others think that they are just entertainment to distract people. I believe that they are important somehow, but not essential.As a matter of fact, world sport events provide positive waves for number of people. The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team. These emotions are shared locally in our village or city, nationally in our own country but even internationally too. Obviously these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased. For example, the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun.Moreover, these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs. Thus, if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal, the reality is different. In other words, this is the ""calm before the storm"". After the Olympics games are finished, everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority. To picture it, recently, Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries, but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn't listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea.Finally, an international sports event is a very good thing to gather people, let them dream, being proud of their nationality and forget problems, but just for a while. These meetings are in none case here to interact with international affairs.";"The phenomenon of world sporting competitions, such as the Olympics or the FIFA World Cup, presents a unique platform that captivates audiences from nearly every corner of the globe. These events are not just mere displays of athletic prowess; they symbolize a shared passion that transcends national borders, uniting diverse cultures in a common celebration of sport. As millions tune in to witness these competitions, they create social stimuli that foster camaraderie and belonging among fans. Public screenings in city squares, community gatherings, and the fervent spirit of local celebrations highlight the extent to which these events can bring people together, even in the face of global challenges.Proponents of sporting events often argue that they serve as a valuable venue for addressing international tension. Nations come together, fostering diplomacy through peaceful competition, as athletes embody mutual respect and sportsmanship. This perspective suggests that by focusing on shared interests, viewers can overlook geopolitical grievances, if only for a fleeting moment. The international stage highlights humanity's commonalities, allowing people to engage in dialogue and build relationships across cultural divides.Conversely, critics contend that these sporting spectacles are merely distractions. They argue that the glitz and glamor of competitions can serve to obscure pressing global issues such as poverty, inequality, and climate change. This viewpoint suggests that instead of fostering meaningful dialogue, these events may divert attention from real problems, preventing society from confronting its challenges head-on. In this light, the excitement surrounding sporting competitions can be seen as a form of escapism, enticing individuals to prioritize entertainment over more substantive engagement with world affairs.Ultimately, the role of world sporting competitions is multifaceted. While they offer a unique opportunity for social unity and cultural exchange, we must balance this with a critical understanding of the underlying issues that persist in our society. The challenge lies in harnessing the spirit of competitiveness and collaboration that these events inspire, ensuring they contribute positively to global discourse rather than distract from it."
137;Many people use distance-learning programmes (study material post,TV,internet...)to study at home. But some people think that it cannot bring the benefit as much as attending college or university. Do you agree or disagree?;With the tremendous development in information technology, long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school. Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate. From my perspective, I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education.To begin with, studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense. Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection. This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line.Besides that, long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches. Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc. A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course.It is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations. These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities. But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts.In conclusion, I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future. However, distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose.;Distance learning has rapidly emerged as a transformative educational model, redefining the traditional landscape of higher education. One significant advantage of distance-learning programs is the considerable reduction in commuting time. With students no longer needing to travel to a physical campus, they can allocate this time toward more productive endeavors, such as studying or working. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for those juggling multiple responsibilities, such as part-time jobs or family commitments.Additionally, the financial savings associated with distance education are substantial. Tuition fees for online courses often tend to be lower than their on-campus counterparts. Moreover, students can save on costs related to commuting, such as gas and public transportation fares, as well as essential expenses like parking fees. The elimination of the need for physical textbooks, with many resources available online at little or no cost, additionally contributes to the overall affordability of distance learning. Students no longer need to purchase expensive textbooks, as digital copies or open educational resources (OER) are increasingly accessible and provide a wealth of information.Beyond the logistical and financial benefits, distance learning opens up a world of knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches. Students can access a plethora of online libraries, journals, and databases that may not be available to those in traditional settings. This extensive access allows learners to explore subjects in depth and at their own pace, promoting a more personalized educational experience. Furthermore, distance education often includes diverse teaching methods, including video lectures, interactive quizzes, and discussion forums that cater to different learning styles. In conclusion, distance learning offers students a unique blend of flexibility, affordability, and accessibility to educational resources. As technology continues to evolve, the potential for remote education will only expand, providing learners with unprecedented opportunities to enrich their academic journeys.
138;There are many extinct species in the world nowadays. Some people say we should protect these animals from dying out, while others say we should concentrate more on problems of human beings. Discuss both opinions and give your personal view.;Many animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons. While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species, others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention. In my opinion, we should give priority to our own issues.Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem. If certain species are absent from this system, such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species, including human beings, will come under threat. Therefore, it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible.However, I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution. The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being. A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment. On most occasions, the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it.Furthermore, human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars. When these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help. We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species.In conclusion, more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals, and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction.;The debate surrounding animal protection often centers on the critical importance of biodiversity in maintaining the balance of ecosystems. Advocates for biodiversity argue that every species plays a unique role in its habitat, contributing to the complex and interdependent web of life that sustains our planet. The extinction of any species, particularly at an accelerated rate driven by human activity, poses significant risks to ecological stability. The loss of biodiversity can disrupt food chains, diminish ecosystem resilience, and ultimately threaten human survival, as we rely on these intricate systems for essential resources such as clean air, water, and food.Conversely, some assert that extinction is a natural phenomenon that has been part of the Earth's evolutionary history. The theory of evolution posits that species arise, thrive, and eventually become extinct over geological timescales. The planet has undergone dramatic changes in climate, geography, and flora and fauna since the dawn of life, leading to the natural turnover of species. Notably, previous mass extinctions have given rise to new and diverse forms of life. Proponents of this perspective might argue that contemporary extinction events, although alarming, are a continuation of this natural process.While it is true that extinction can occur through natural processes, the current rate of species loss is unprecedented, largely driven by anthropogenic factors, such as habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change. As stewards of the Earth, humans have a responsibility to mitigate these impacts and preserve the biodiversity that sustains not only our ecosystems but also our societies. The challenge lies in reconciling the natural processes of extinction with the imperative to protect the living diversity that enables ecosystems to thrive. Ultimately, recognizing the interconnectedness of all life can inspire a more harmonious relationship with our environment, balancing respect for natural evolutionary processes with a commitment to conservation.
139;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;In today's context, education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one's future. In my personal opinion, I am totally agreed with the view that there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses. There appear to be various reasons often strike in my mind in support of this position. To begin with, judging student's skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular. Nowadays, both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education. In India, for example, female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations. Furthermore, female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops, unlike previous generation females. In addition, due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments, female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace, despite its intensive stress and pressure. For example, Chanda Kochhar, who is the CEO of India's second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country's most powerful female head in business sector. In conclusion, I am firmly supporting the view, that every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects, provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender. Government should take interim measures, to regulate admission process for university courses which enables every student to get benefit.;In today's society, education stands as the cornerstone that shapes an individual’s future. It equips individuals with essential skills and knowledge, opening the doors to countless opportunities in life. In this context, it is vital that educational institutions uphold the principles of fairness and equality. One area where this equity must be evident is in the allocation of university seats, which should be non-discriminatory with respect to gender.First and foremost, partiality based on gender undermines the very ethos of education as a meritocratic institution. Every student, regardless of their gender, should have equal access to educational resources and opportunities. By favoring one gender over another, universities not only compromise the quality of their education but also send a misleading message about the capabilities of individuals based on their gender. This perpetuates stereotypes and discourages talented individuals from pursuing their aspirations.Moreover, diversity within educational settings is crucial for holistic learning. When students from different genders come together, they bring varied perspectives and experiences that enrich classroom discussions. Inclusive environments encourage collaboration and innovation, preparing students to thrive in a diverse workforce. Thus, ensuring equal representation in university admissions fosters a culture of inclusivity that benefits not just the students, but society as a whole.Additionally, gender-based biases in education can lead to long-term inequalities in the job market. By denying equal opportunities in university admissions, we inadvertently reinforce the cycle of disadvantage for certain genders. It is essential that educational institutions strive to create a level playing field, as this can lead to a more balanced and equitable society where individuals are assessed based on their abilities rather than their gender.In conclusion, education is undoubtedly a significant determinant of one’s future, and it is imperative that universities adhere to principles of fairness in seat allocation. Eliminating gender bias ensures a more equitable educational landscape, fostering growth, diversity, and long-term positive societal change.
141;One of the consequences of improved medical care is that people are living longer and life expectancy is increasing. Do you think the disadvantages of this development outweight the disadvantages?;Along with the development of technologies, advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy. Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system, I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages.The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health. They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity. In other words, they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost.In addition, a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society. In facts, young people will be happy as their parents, grandparents are healthy. It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people.On the other hand, some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system. Although it is real in some aspects, I believe that the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time, so they are worth to have good care. They have given their effort to the society so that young people, the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system.By way of conclusion, it is true that the development of the health care system helps people have a better life. It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old.;Advanced medical care has significantly contributed to the remarkable increase in life expectancy over the past century. The evolution of medical technology and practices has not only revolutionized the way ailments are diagnosed and treated, but it has also transformed the overall approach to healthcare. Today, we benefit from cutting-edge innovations such as telemedicine, robotic surgeries, and personalized medicine, all of which enhance the quality of care patients receive. As a result, individuals can enjoy longer, healthier lives, free from the debilitating impacts of many diseases that were once considered fatal.One of the primary advantages of high-tech medical care is its capacity to provide better health management. With new diagnostic tools, such as advanced imaging techniques and lab tests, healthcare providers can identify and address health issues earlier and more accurately. This proactive approach empowers patients to engage in preventive care, allowing for timely interventions that significantly improve health outcomes. Moreover, the availability of specialized care for chronic diseases, such as diabetes and heart conditions, enables individuals to maintain their health status and lead productive lives well into their senior years.The presence of a healthy elderly population contributes significantly to the sustainable development of society. Older individuals who remain active and healthy can continue to contribute economically, socially, and culturally, thus alleviating some of the burdens associated with an aging population. They can volunteer, mentor younger generations, and share their invaluable life experiences, thereby fostering community cohesion. Additionally, a healthier older demographic reduces the strain on healthcare systems and social programs, allowing resources to be allocated more effectively.In conclusion, advanced medical care has undeniably enhanced life expectancy, providing individuals with better health management and fostering healthier elderly communities. Such communities are essential for sustainable development, ensuring that society benefits from the wisdom and capabilities of its older citizens. As we continue to innovate in healthcare, we pave the way for a future where individuals live longer, healthier lives, contributing positively to society at large.
143;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;The purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society, especially in high level such as college or university. Some people think that all students should deserve to be educated at this level. However, in my opinion, it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners.First, focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality. Unlike middle school or high school, university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge. In fact, some students may be capable in high schools, but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones. That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people, and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions, since they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone.Secondly, university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes. Some people argue that this may lead to 'social division', when someone with high education refuses to do the called 'low jobs', but actually it gives no harm to the whole community. Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone, while complex ones should be only handled by the best people, who start their career from the best institutions. I think limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice since it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning, which makes them do the best to improve themselves. Ultimately, this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society.To sum thing up, I agree that everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school, but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students. This will improve the quality of both universities and students, thus placing people in positions which suit them most.;The purpose of education is a topic that has long been subjected to debate among scholars, policymakers, and the general public. While perspectives vary widely, I hold the view that educational institutions should focus on admitting and nurturing a select group of talented and knowledgeable students. This approach not only serves to elevate the quality of education but also meets the demands of a sophisticated and evolving job market.By concentrating their efforts on academically gifted individuals, universities can ensure that the educational environment remains one of high standards and rigorous intellectual engagement. Talented students often exhibit greater motivation, passion, and potential for innovation, contributing to a more dynamic learning atmosphere. This synergy of high-caliber peers leads to collaborative growth, enhancing the educational experience through shared ideas and insights. In essence, admitting only capable students cultivates a culture of excellence, driving all participants to reach their full potential.Moreover, focusing on exceptional students translates into better human resources for society. When universities channel their resources toward nurturing academically proficient individuals, they produce graduates equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary for addressing complex global challenges. As industries increasingly demand specialized expertise, it becomes imperative for higher education institutions to generate a workforce that meets these sophisticated needs. By maintaining high admission standards, universities can produce leaders, innovators, and problem-solvers who are adept at contributing meaningfully to various fields.In conclusion, while the purpose of education remains a nuanced conversation, emphasizing the admission and training of talented students is a strategic choice. This focus not only sustains the integrity and quality of academic programs but also equips society with capable individuals ready to tackle the demands of an ever-changing world. Therefore, it is essential for academic institutions to prioritize excellence in their admission processes, fostering a future where both education and society thrive.
144;Agree or disagree? Universities spend money on improving facilities (labs and general requirements) better than hiring famous teachers.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers, and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities, while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to spend money on improving facilities. The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have, the more chances we can increase our knowledge. For example, library is a good place for students to study or research. They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience; also, there are a lot of references for students to utilize. With this convenient and versatile facility, students can improve their learning condition. Therefore, we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students. Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms. They have numerous activities in school. Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school. He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance. With this distinguished performance, the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities.Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study. It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards. Based on the reasons demonstrate above, I believe that improving facilities is the best way for school because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other. In other words, students can procure more advantages from better facilities. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I an firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";"In the debate surrounding educational improvements, a recurring discussion centers on whether schools should prioritize investing in modern facilities or attracting renowned teachers. Both perspectives hold merit; however, I firmly believe that enhancing school facilities offers more significant advantages for students' overall learning experience.Investing in modern facilities can profoundly impact students' academic performance and personal development. Well-designed classrooms equipped with contemporary technology create an engaging learning environment that fosters creativity and critical thinking. For instance, schools that provide access to interactive smartboards, updated library resources, and science laboratories with advanced equipment enhance students' practical skills and broaden their educational horizons. Moreover, comfortable and inviting spaces can increase student motivation and attendance, contributing to higher academic achievement.On the other hand, while having famous teachers can undoubtedly inspire students and elevate school prestige, the effects are often limited to individual classrooms. Renowned educators may possess exceptional teaching abilities and charisma, yet their influence might not extend beyond their immediate cohort. Additionally, attracting such talent often comes with higher salaries, which may strain a school’s budget and limit resources for other vital areas, including infrastructure improvements.Furthermore, investments in facilities benefit every student rather than just those fortunate enough to be in a celebrated teacher’s class. Facilities such as gyms, sports fields, and community spaces promote physical well-being and social development, critical components of a holistic education. When students engage in extracurricular activities in modern, safe areas, they develop teamwork and leadership skills that are crucial for success beyond school.In conclusion, while both modern facilities and famous teachers have unique advantages, I believe that investing in school infrastructure yields more substantial and widespread benefits for student success. Enhanced facilities create an inclusive, stimulating, and equitable learning environment that fosters the development of all students."
145;Do you agree or dis agree with the following statement? High schools should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Some people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to. They believe this motivates students to study. I think, however, students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics. I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university. In addition, it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles.To begin with, students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested. They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects, otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject. For instance, a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field.Next, students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields. General education plays a significant role in specialized education. Science today, for example, is said to be more and more specialized, but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics. In addition, although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects, in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects. For instance, you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry. Therefore, high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university.Last but not least, students have tendency to shun difficulties. They might avoid tough courses, but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much. This might result in limited choices in the future. Therefore, schools should be responsible for their future and protect them.In summary, students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education. Besides, high school must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum.;Choosing a field of study is one of the most significant decisions a student will make, influencing both their academic path and future career. However, students should approach this decision with flexibility and an open mind. Engaging with a wide variety of subjects before finalizing one’s major is crucial for a few key reasons. Firstly, exposure to different disciplines allows students to discover their genuine interests and strengths. Each subject presents unique perspectives, skills, and methodologies, which can illuminate passions that might otherwise remain unexplored. For example, a student who initially leans towards science may find a profound interest in literature or philosophy after taking an introductory course. Such experiences foster a more holistic educational journey, encouraging students to consider interdisciplinary connections that may later enrich their specialized studies.Secondly, the broad exposure during the initial years of tertiary education equips students with essential skills applicable across numerous fields. Adaptability, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving are vital competencies that transcend subject boundaries. By immersing themselves in various disciplines, students not only gain knowledge but also develop a versatile skill set that can be advantageous in an ever-evolving job market.Ultimately, the purpose of tertiary education is to prepare students for specialization at university, yet this preparation should stem from a foundation built on exploration. A well-rounded education cultivates an informed and engaged citizenry capable of understanding complex global issues. Therefore, students should embrace the diversity of subjects available to them before committing to a major. This careful consideration ensures not only a more satisfying academic experience but can also lead to more fulfilling career paths, as students find a field that truly resonates with their interests and aspirations.
146;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Games are as important for adults as they are for children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As people grow up, the arguments about the importance of games arise. Some people think that, adults need playing games as children do. However, in my opinion, games are no longer too important for them for several reasons.The first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin. Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life. But, more often, the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies, and as a result, they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago. For example, in my country, except for a minor part of professional athletes, the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job. They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives.Another reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity, while children are always keen on competition and winning. For youngsters, maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not. For example, my younger sister likes fencing, and thanks to her desire to win, she never gives up when facing a difficult situation, or even becoming hurt. On the other hand, adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately. In fact, a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues. Because of that, they no longer play games for any moderate achievements, and gradually lose their interest in such activities.To sum up, I think adults do need to play games, but their styles are often distinct from children's, which are often less competitive and more enjoyable. Along with the high requirement for family and work, games are just some leisure activities for adults, not something necessary as they are meant to be for children.;In recent years, the debate surrounding the importance of games and play for adults has gained traction. Some individuals argue that adults, just like children, require recreational games to foster mental wellness and social connections. However, I contend that for many adults, the significance of games has diminished for several reasons, primarily due to the increasing pressures of work and family commitments.Firstly, the relentless demands of professional life often consume the majority of an adult's time and energy. With job responsibilities, deadlines, and the constant need for career advancement, many adults find themselves in a race against time. The pursuit of professional success frequently leaves little room for leisure activities, including games that were once a source of joy and relaxation. Consequently, as individuals prioritize their careers, they often abandon lifelong hobbies that once brought them delight.Moreover, family obligations further complicate the situation. For adults raising children or managing household responsibilities, time becomes a precious commodity. An evening that could have been spent playing games is often dedicated to attending to family needs or managing household chores. The necessity to provide for and nurture family members becomes the top priority, pushing personal interests to the sidelines. This shift signifies a change in lifestyle, where the notion of play takes a backseat to responsibilities that demand immediate attention.While playing games can certainly benefit adults by promoting relaxation and fostering social interaction, it must be acknowledged that life stages evolve and priorities change. For many adults, responsibilities in their professional and personal lives outweigh the desire or ability to engage in games. As such, while play is an essential aspect of childhood, its significance for adults appears to be overshadowed by modern societal demands and life commitments. Ultimately, the reality is that while play remains beneficial, it may no longer hold the same importance for adults as it does for children.
147;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Modern technology is creating a single world culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"There are many different opinions regarding world culture. Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture. However, in my view, a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons.Firstly, most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology. Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data, and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint. For example, students who are studying in Iran use the same software, Microsoft, to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students.Secondly, new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world. Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries, and students are being encouraged to study in this field. For example, many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries. This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries.Some people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture, and technology cannot affect them. This point has some merits on the surface; however, many countries such as Canada, the USA, and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures. In fact, cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet. For example, two days ago, I went to a Canadian restaurant, and I ate noodle, sushi, which are Chinese foods, and Greek salad.To sum up, new technology has affected cultures of the world, and we can see many similarities in many cultures. In fact, new technology has influences on educational system, jobs and foods in the world.";"The rapid advancement of technology has significantly influenced cultures across the globe, resulting in striking similarities among diverse societies. As countries become increasingly interconnected, traditional boundaries are blurred, giving way to a more homogenized culture shaped largely by modern technology. One vivid example can be found in the realm of education, where students worldwide, regardless of their geographical location, frequently employ the same software applications to perform academic tasks. For instance, students in Iran and Canada both utilize Microsoft Office for writing essays, preparing presentations, and collaborating on projects. This shared reliance on a common software platform highlights how technological tools transcend cultural barriers and foster a sense of global unity.Several factors have contributed to the emergence of a single modern culture driven by technology. Firstly, the internet has created a global village, where information and resources are readily accessible to anyone with a connection. This facilitates not only the exchange of ideas but also standardizes practices across different cultural contexts. Students, whether in Tehran or Toronto, access the same online resources, partake in similar learning experiences, and engage with content that often reflects Western ideals, propelling a convergence of cultural norms and values.Secondly, the rise of social media platforms enables instantaneous communication and interaction among individuals from disparate backgrounds. This connectivity fosters a shared experience, as people participate in global trends, memes, and challenges that reinforce mutual understanding and shared values. In conclusion, modern technology is not merely a tool for communication and convenience; it actively shapes our cultural landscapes. As students in various parts of the world increasingly engage with the same programs and social platforms, a contemporary global culture gradually emerges, characterized by shared practices and perspectives that transcend traditional cultural divides. This evolution reflects the transformative power of technology in creating a more interconnected world."
148;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Nowadays it is much easier to achieve success with the help from one's family than what is like before;There are many factors that contribute to one's success. However, which factor is the most influential one is open to debate. Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one's success. It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family. I agree with this statement. In my opinion, family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success. There are a couple of reasons.First of all, more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university. Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did, they can provide more advices and helps in our career. In the past, seldom people have the chance to attend a collage. For example, my grandparents did not get a education even in high school, so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood, he had to go to his teacher for help. Things have changed a lot. I grow up in a better condition than my father did. Whenever I have problems, I can always ask my parents for help. They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot. What is more, family members can help us in many other aspects. For example, when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university, my father told a lot about different majors. He shared his own experience with me, which helped me quite a lot. Parents are quite experienced than their child, they can guide them toward the right direction. Besides, parents can told their children as many as they can. What they want is help their child to make a progress.In a word, our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life. I believe that with the help of our family, we can achieve success quite easily.;In today’s fast-paced and increasingly competitive world, the role of family in an individual’s journey towards success cannot be overstated. Many believe that assistance from family is a crucial factor in achieving one’s goals, and I wholeheartedly agree. In my opinion, family plays a more important role in helping an individual pursue success due to the emotional support they provide and the foundational values they instill.Firstly, emotional support is vital in navigating the challenges that accompany the pursuit of success. Family members often serve as pillars of strength, offering encouragement and motivation during tough times. For instance, when a student faces academic hurdles or a professional is confronted with setbacks, having a supportive family can make a significant difference. They are often the ones who celebrate milestones with you, lift you when you fall, and remind you of your capabilities in moments of self-doubt. This emotional backing fosters resilience, enabling individuals to persist despite difficulties and thus increases their chances of achieving their aspirations.Secondly, families play an essential role in instilling foundational values such as hard work, discipline, and perseverance. From a young age, children observe and learn from their parents’ attitudes and behaviors. For instance, a household that emphasizes the importance of education is likely to breed academically successful individuals. Similarly, families that promote a strong work ethic are likely to raise kids who understand the importance of diligence in achieving their goals. These ingrained values create a strong foundation that supports an individual's efforts and ambitions as they navigate their path toward success.In conclusion, family assistance is vital for success in today's world. Through emotional support and the establishment of core values, families equip individuals with the necessary tools to not only dream big but also to convert those dreams into reality. Thus, it is clear that family plays an indispensable role in the pursuit of success.
149;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Reading fiction (such as novels and short stories) is more enjoyable than watching movies. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;"There are many different opinions regarding hobbies. Some people would rather watch TV. However, in my view, reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons.Firstly, fiction books pay more attention to details. In fact, we can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it. Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening. For example, after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people. However, a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters.Secondly, reading a novel is more convenient. Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour. Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains. For example, I have started to read a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class. In contrast, I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study.Some people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies. This point has some merits on the surface; however, movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners. For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable.To sum up, reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners.";Reading fiction offers a unique and immersive experience that many find more enjoyable than watching movies, and this preference can be attributed to several compelling reasons. Firstly, fiction books often pay greater attention to details compared to their cinematic counterparts. When readers delve into a novel, they are exposed to rich and nuanced descriptions that paint vivid pictures in their minds. Authors meticulously craft their narratives, allowing for deeper explorations of characters’ thoughts, emotions, and backgrounds, which can lead to a more profound connection with the story. This intricate attention to detail can create layers of meaning that may be lost in the rapidly unfolding visual narratives of films. Readers are invited to imagine the settings, contemplate the motivations behind characters' actions, and engage their intellect and emotions in ways that movies, with their time constraints, rarely allow.Secondly, reading a novel proves to be more convenient in our busy lives. Many novels are designed to accommodate diverse reading paces, with some comprising around 100 pages that can be savored over time. A reader might choose to engage with a book for just a brief session as they tackle other responsibilities. In contrast, films often demand a continuous viewing period of over an hour and a half. This can be challenging, especially for students who may only have a fleeting window—like 15 minutes—before needing to refocus on their studies. While reading, one can pause at any moment, reflect on the content, and then resume later without losing the thread of the narrative.In conclusion, the rich detail found in fiction and the flexible nature of reading make it a more enjoyable pursuit than watching movies for many individuals, particularly those navigating the pressures of modern life. The experience of reading allows for contemplation, connection, and convenience that enhances the enjoyment of storytelling.
150;Several languages die every year. Many people feel this is a positive trend and that a world with fewer language promotes harmony and understanding between people. Analyze both sides of this argument and provide your opinion.;"Today, English is commonly used language across the world. Its usage is increasing day by day. As a consequence, various local languages are becoming extinct. Some people argue that, this is a positive change and would help people to easily communicate. While there are others who disagree with this and are more concerned about dying local languages. In my opinion, I believe using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live.A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way. Due to globalization, many people are traveling for professional trips. So, communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places. Furthermore, students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress as they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment. Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people. Adding to that, exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics, medical, astronomy etc would become easier.On the other hand, few people are worried about the dying local languages. These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures. They represent local culture. As the usage of these languages decrease, culture also changes accordingly. Further, these languages are tightly coupled with history; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost.To conclude, I believe change is inevitable and that usage of one language across the world is a positive one. We have to accept these changes for a world to be a better place. Communication in single language would improve the productivity of the world and brings everyone on to the same page.";"The concept of a single global language has garnered significant attention in recent years, with proponents arguing that such a change could lead to a more connected and harmonious world. Advocates for a universal language assert that it would tirelessly work to minimize daily challenges that arise from linguistic diversity. For instance, travelers often face obstacles when attempting to communicate, leading to confusion and frustration—whether they are ordering food in a restaurant or asking for directions. A common language would undoubtedly alleviate these issues, enabling individuals to navigate new environments with greater ease and confidence.Moreover, the use of a single language could significantly reduce misunderstandings and miscommunications, which are frequently exacerbated by language barriers. In a multicultural society, nuances in language can lead to unintended offense or conflict. A unified language affords people the opportunity to express themselves clearly and understand one another more completely, fostering a culture of empathy and collaboration. When language becomes a unifying factor rather than a dividing one, it encourages cultural exchange and understanding, ultimately leading to a more peaceful coexistence.However, while the idea of a single language may suggest an immediate solution to communication hurdles, this perspective overlooks the rich tapestry of linguistic diversity that characterizes human culture. Languages are not merely tools for communication; they embody distinctive worldviews and histories. Abolishing them could risk erasing invaluable cultural identities.In conclusion, the argument for a single global language presents compelling benefits for ease of communication and the reduction of misunderstandings. However, it is crucial to balance these advantages with the need to preserve the rich diversity that languages provide. Ultimately, fostering multilingualism, rather than uniformity, may be the key to a truly connected and understanding world."
151;Elderly people think that the way they spent their life was simpler and better than today. Do you agree or disagree? Provide you reasons and real life example;Changes are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in. Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing. I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons.We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place. A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones. The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts. Moreover, some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication. In my opinion though, social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch, the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago. The phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in. Today, even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists. The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives. To be specific, scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough. In general, the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine.In conclusion, even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends, I think they are wrong, since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice. In light of the above-mentioned facts, one can easily conclude that in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically.;In the contemporary era, we find ourselves enveloped in a whirlwind of technological advancement, evolving at an unprecedented pace akin to the speed of light. This rapid evolution is steering our world toward a more convenient existence, revolutionizing the way we interact, communicate, and live. Among the plethora of sectors benefiting from this technological renaissance, the field of medical science has witnessed phenomenal progress over the last decade. This advancement represents a monumental achievement for humanity, propelling us toward a healthier and, consequently, a happier society.One of the most notable advancements in medical science has been the development of cutting-edge diagnostic tools. Artificial intelligence and machine learning have drastically improved the accuracy and efficiency with which diseases are detected. Innovations in imaging technologies, such as MRI and CT scans, have transcended traditional methods, enabling healthcare professionals to obtain more detailed insights into a patient’s condition. Early detection, made possible by these state-of-the-art tools, has substantially increased survival rates for various ailments, particularly in cancer treatment, thereby enhancing the quality of life for countless individuals.Moreover, the evolution of telemedicine and remote patient monitoring has redefined healthcare accessibility. In a world where time and convenience are paramount, patients can now consult with healthcare providers from the comfort of their homes, eliminating geographical barriers that once hindered access to quality care. This shift is especially crucial for those in rural areas or those facing mobility challenges, ensuring that healthcare is equitable and inclusive.Furthermore, the rapid development of the mRNA vaccine technology represents another beacon of hope, showcasing how quickly science can adapt and respond to global health crises. The swift creation and distribution of vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic exemplify the remarkable synergy between technology and medical science, illustrating our capacity to overcome challenges.In conclusion, as we navigate this era defined by swift technological advancements, the strides made in medical science signal a bright future. A world that prioritizes health not only contributes to individual well-being but also cultivates a collective happiness, fostering communities where people can thrive.
152;Some people say that all secondary school and higher school students should be taught how to manage money as its an important life skill. Do you agree or disagree with this argument?;There is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before. Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate. Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money, while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal. In my view, I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management.The reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is, primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation, students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family, during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence. For example, while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month, I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses, during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses.In addition, if financial management is taught at an early age, students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status, students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized. For example, buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background. However, for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour. Hence, having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently.In conclusion, I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact. However, the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense.;Teaching financial management to juvenile students has become a point of contention among educators and parents alike. Some argue that introducing children to concepts related to money at a young age could have detrimental effects, fostering an unhealthy obsession with wealth or creating undue stress about financial matters. However, I firmly believe that high school students should be educated about money management, as this knowledge is crucial for their future success and independence.In today's world, financial literacy is more important than ever. With the rise of student debt, credit cards, and the complexities of banking, young adults are often ill-prepared to make informed financial decisions. By imparting financial management skills to high school students, we equip them with the tools necessary to navigate these challenges effectively. Understanding budgeting, saving, investing, and the impact of credit can help adolescents develop a sense of responsibility and foresight about their financial futures.Furthermore, learning about money management can foster critical thinking and decision-making skills. As students engage with financial concepts, they learn to weigh the pros and cons of spending and saving, encouraging a mindset that values long-term financial health over short-term gratification. This education cultivates a culture of self-sufficiency, empowering students to take control of their financial destinies as they transition into adulthood.While concerns about young people becoming overly focused on money are valid, the benefits of teaching financial management far outweigh these risks. Educators and parents can approach this subject with a balanced perspective, emphasizing the importance of financial health without promoting materialism. Ultimately, preparing students for financial realities is an investment in their future, and a necessary step in fostering responsible, informed citizens.
154;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants, and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld.;Generally speaking, smoking is never been good for human's body. There are so many researches done to prove that a cigar contains harmful ingredients for human's body. Although many smokers claim that they need to smoke in order to work more effectively or to think more creatively, those reasons never proves that smoking has any benefits for human's body. In my opinion, smoking should not be permitted, especially in public places like restaurants because it will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably.First of all, restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals. Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals. They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them. Secondly, restaurants are places that people usually come with their families. This means, there will be children, grandparents, as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants. Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children. Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something. Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders' health, especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs. The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies.Last but not least, passive smokers will have a lot of health risks. When they are around the active smokers, they will inhale hazardous smoke. Stroke, heart disorders, hearing loss, and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers. Personally speaking, it is unfair for passive smokers because they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one.In conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants because there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged. State laws that prohibit it should be upheld so the restaurant' management can make a clear rule in their restaurants because everyone has a right to enjoy their meals.;Smoking in restaurants has become a contentious issue, and there are compelling reasons why it should not be permitted. One of the primary arguments against smoking in dining establishments is the impact it has on non-smokers. Restaurants are places where individuals and families come to enjoy good food and pleasant company. When smoking is allowed, non-smokers are often forced to breathe in harmful secondhand smoke, leading to discomfort and potential health risks. The atmosphere, which should be enjoyable and welcoming, is tainted by the presence of smoke, detracting from the overall dining experience. Moreover, allowing smoking in restaurants sets a negative example for impressionable audiences, especially children and young adults. Children often mimic the behaviors of those around them, and consistent exposure to smoking can normalize this harmful addiction. Additionally, pregnant women and older adults, such as grandparents, are particularly vulnerable to the detrimental effects of secondhand smoke. They deserve to dine in environments that do not pose a risk to their health and the health of their unborn children.It is crucial to recognize that passive smokers face unfair health risks. Passive smoking, which occurs when non-smokers inhale smoke from nearby smokers, can lead to severe health complications similar to those experienced by active smokers. This situation creates an inequitable dynamic whereby individuals who choose not to smoke are still exposed to its harmful effects, thrusting upon them the consequences of a habit they did not choose.In conclusion, smoking should not be allowed in restaurants to ensure a comfortable dining experience for all patrons, protect vulnerable populations, and promote healthier lifestyle choices. The health and well-being of non-smokers, especially children and pregnant women, must take precedence over the right of individuals to smoke in these shared spaces.
155;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way?;It's obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years. This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film. From my point of view, I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors, emotions & study.In the first place, children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best. Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs. Imagine an actor who is a child’s favorite is doing violent roles. In this case, the child would imitate the actor's behaviors in order to look like to him. Thus, unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors.Meanwhile, human beings are very sensitive, especially of youngsters. For instance, dying is always a disappointing happening. Furthermore, killing is worse. Therefore, if these scenes are in TV, they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child.Finally, beside all above mentioned items, the study of youngsters shall always been controlled. For example, a child watches a frightening movie. On the other hand, he has to study for the exam. In this condition, because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it, it is obvious that he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly. Hence, the study of a youngster would affected terribly.In conclusion, I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study, emotions and behaviors. Therefore, I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors.;Over the past two decades, there has been a noticeable escalation in violent behavior portrayed in films. This trend has been leveraged by filmmakers as a marketing strategy, enticing audiences with the promise of thrilling and intense cinematic experiences. While such tactics may lead to increased box office sales, the implications of this violence are far-reaching, particularly concerning the impressionable minds of youngsters. In my view, the pervasive depiction of violence in movies has detrimental effects on the behaviors, emotions, and academic pursuits of young viewers.First and foremost, exposure to violence can significantly influence a child's or teenager's behavior. Studies have shown that repeated viewing of violent content can desensitize viewers, making them more indifferent to real-life violence. This desensitization can manifest in increased aggression, as young audiences may begin to see violent actions as acceptable or even normal responses to conflict. Moreover, they may mimic the aggressive behaviors and attitudes they observe on screen, leading to conflicts with peers, family members, and authority figures.Beyond behavior, the emotional ramifications of consuming violent films cannot be overlooked. Young individuals may experience heightened anxiety, fear, or even distress as a result of graphic depictions of violence. Instead of promoting resilience and emotional health, these films can exacerbate feelings of helplessness and vulnerability, potentially leading to mental health issues. Additionally, the constant exposure to conflict and negativity can shift a young person's emotional outlook on life, causing them to develop cynicism rather than empathy.Furthermore, the allure of violent films can distract young viewers from their studies. With countless hours spent watching movies filled with violence, time that could be devoted to educational activities is lost. This diversion not only affects their academic performance but also deprives them of the critical thinking and problem-solving skills nurtured through healthy engagements.In conclusion, while violent films may be marketed as exhilarating entertainment, their impact on young audiences runs deeper. The negative effects on behavior, emotional well-being, and academic focus in youngsters warrant serious consideration. As a society, we must critically assess the media we consume and strive towards narratives that promote positivity, understanding, and growth.
156;Agree or disagree: In order to be well-informed, a person must get information from many different news sources.;"Nowadays information plays an important role in our world. It has become a product, which can be sold, bought, or stolen. Some people say: ""information is power"". That's why it is so important to be well-informed. I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons.The first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability. Some people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information. For example, Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia. After a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia.Secondly, it is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations, because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate. Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts, especially in the internet, that's why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts. It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong. For example, several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops. The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the ""salt-panic"" was over. To conclude, I want to say that it is very important to be confident of the information, which you use, especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence.";"The adage ""information is power"" resonates deeply in our contemporary society, where knowledge plays a pivotal role in decision-making, policy formation, and personal empowerment. In an era characterized by an overwhelming influx of information, the necessity to be well-informed is more critical than ever. Having access to accurate and comprehensive information allows individuals to form informed opinions, make educated choices, and engage actively in societal dialogue.To ensure the reliability of the information we consume, it is paramount to utilize diverse sources. Relying on a single source, be it a news outlet, social media, or academic publications, can lead to a skewed understanding of events, issues, or problems. Different sources provide varying perspectives and interpretations, which can contribute to a more nuanced comprehension of complex topics. Furthermore, examining information from various platforms helps to identify biases, enabling individuals to sift through the noise of misinformation that often proliferates in today’s digital age.Moreover, distinguishing between facts and estimations is crucial. While estimates can provide useful context, they often lack the precision needed to grasp the full scope of an issue. Facts, rooted in evidence and data, serve as a solid foundation for developing informed viewpoints. For instance, understanding the factual statistics behind climate change or public health crises empowers citizens to advocate for effective policies and to hold leaders accountable.In conclusion, the notion that ""information is power"" underscores the importance of being well-informed in our rapidly changing world. By employing a variety of reliable sources and prioritizing factual information over mere estimations, individuals can enhance their understanding of critical issues and contribute meaningfully to discourse in society. The pursuit of knowledge not only enriches personal growth but also fosters a more informed and engaged citizenry."
157;Some people argue that there is no point in persevering old buildings when land is so valuable in our cities. Others believe that old buildings are important part of our heritage and should be preserved. Discuss both these views and state your opinion.;The preservation of old buildings always is a large question for governments because conflict between the issues of housing for citizens and the protection of our culture. In my opinion, all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved.There are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings. As a result of the rapid urbanization process, in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities, the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing. Because of that need, governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings. Besides that, the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values. Old buildings are an essential part of history. Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings. Therefore, managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation. Furthermore, the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them. Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there. . Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty, and that preservation help to finish half of work.	Overall, both of those view have strong arguments: the need for housing or the expense of restoration contrast with our desire to conserve culture and attract tourism. So I think we should restore those building because old buildings process the most outstanding feature of areas which contain them.;"The preservation of old buildings is often a contentious issue for governments worldwide, as it brings to the forefront a conflict between the pressing need for housing and the imperative to protect our cultural heritage. As urban areas continue to expand and populations grow, the demand for affordable housing intensifies, leading to the potential demolition of historically significant structures. In my opinion, all old buildings that contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved, as they serve as vital links to our past and define the character of our communities.Old buildings are more than mere structures; they are repositories of history, craftsmanship, and identity. Each brick and beam tells a story, embodying the values, aesthetics, and traditions of the time when they were built. Preserving these structures allows future generations to connect with their heritage, instilling a sense of pride and continuity within the community. Moreover, culturally rich environments enhance the quality of life for residents, as they create unique spaces that foster creativity and social interaction.While the challenge of accommodating a growing populace is undeniable, creative solutions exist that can address both housing needs and cultural preservation. Adaptive reuse, for instance, transforms old buildings into functional spaces while maintaining their historical significance. With thoughtful planning and investment, governments can revitalize urban areas without sacrificing their cultural landmarks.In conclusion, the preservation of old buildings is crucial for maintaining cultural identity and heritage. Governments should prioritize the conservation of structures that contribute to our shared history, finding innovative ways to balance the need for housing with the responsibility to protect our cultural legacy. In doing so, they can ensure that communities thrive both today and in the future, rooted in a rich tapestry of history."
158;Nowadays, many young people say that mobile phones are the most important thing in their life. Do you think the popularity of mobile phones to young people is a good or bad development? Give relevant examples from your own experience.;Nowadays, many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends. Despite all these positive aspects, I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development.First of all, many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones. Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time, leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities. Similarly, internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works. In my college days, I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone. I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends. That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester.Secondly, juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic. They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand. Relatively, these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost. Furthermore, most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want. An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days, wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents. This clearly shows that the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person’s education and character. Therefore, I highly discourage the young ones to be overly dependent on mobile phones.;In today's digital age, mobile phones have become integral to the lives of many young people. They serve as tools for communication, entertainment, and information access, which has led to a significant reliance on these devices. While there are undeniable benefits associated with mobile phone usage, I believe that their growing popularity among the younger generation represents a troubling trend.Firstly, the frequent use of mobile phones can severely hinder academic performance. Many students find themselves distracted by notifications, social media updates, and games, often prioritizing these over their studies. Research has shown that students who frequently check their phones during class or while studying tend to retain less information and perform poorly in assessments. This constant distraction can create a detrimental cycle where students, entranced by their devices, neglect the foundational skills and knowledge necessary for their educational growth.Moreover, mobile phones also contribute to a materialistic mindset among young users. With the constant exposure to carefully curated online personas and consumer products through social media, many young people develop an unhealthy obsession with material possessions. The desire to emulate the lifestyles of influencers or peers can lead to a fixation on acquiring the latest technology or fashion, overshadowing more meaningful values such as relationships and personal growth. This emphasis on materialism can create a sense of dissatisfaction and lead to constant comparison, undermining young people's self-esteem and overall well-being.In conclusion, while mobile phones undeniably offer numerous benefits, their prevalence among the youth is concerning. The distractions they create can impede academic success, while the materialistic tendencies fostered by these devices can distort young people's values. It is crucial for parents, educators, and society as a whole to find a balance, encouraging responsible phone use while fostering an environment that prioritizes education and meaningful connections.
159;Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Others, however,argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.;"Generally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders. Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime. Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions, that forces to a person to be a criminal.First of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime. Secondly, laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance ""a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women, who steals for her drug addiction"". The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place.On the contrary, fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government. Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal. Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other.To conclude, Government should decide for punishment case by case basis. In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution.";"The concept of fixed punishments for specific crimes often appears attractive in the pursuit of a more efficient judicial system. Advocates argue it could expedite court proceedings and enhance economic efficiency for governments by reducing legal expenses. However, an unwavering system of fixed penalties carries significant drawbacks that could ultimately exacerbate criminal behavior.First and foremost, establishing fixed punishments would provide professional criminals with a clear understanding of the consequences of their actions. When the repercussions for a crime are well defined, it becomes less of a deterrent; seasoned offenders may calculate the risks and rewards of their actions, deciding that the potential gain is worth the known penalty. For instance, if a thief knows that stealing will invariably result in a five-year prison sentence, they may become more emboldened, especially if they perceive the benefits of their actions to outweigh the consequences. This predictability could indeed lead to an increase in crime rates, as offenders would no longer fear the unpredictability of the legal system.Additionally, while fixed punishments might streamline judicial processes, this approach overlooks the nuances involved in individual cases. The law is not a one-size-fits-all endeavor; various circumstances warrant consideration, including intent, societal context, and the impact on victims. A rigid system could unjustly punish individuals who committed offenses under mitigating circumstances, thereby eroding faith in the justice system.Moreover, the economic argument for fixed punishments may be short-sighted. Although initial savings in court time might exist, a higher crime rate would lead to increased long-term costs associated with incarceration, law enforcement, and societal implications of crime. In conclusion, while fixed punishments could theoretically offer some efficiency improvements, the potential rise in criminal activity and the loss of judicial flexibility pose significant risks. A balanced approach that considers both the nature of the crime and the circumstances surrounding it remains essential for an effective legal system."
161;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;Cheap airfares have revolutionized travel, making it accessible to a broader segment of society, particularly for lower-income groups. In the past, air travel was often viewed as a luxury reserved for the affluent. However, the proliferation of budget airlines and competitive pricing has democratized access to air transportation. This newfound affordability allows families to venture beyond their local confines, fostering cultural exchanges, enhancing tourism, and enabling countless individuals to seek new opportunities around the globe. The positive impact on the economy is significant, as travel stimulates various sectors, including hospitality and local businesses. Despite these benefits, the surge in air travel presents serious environmental concerns, notably the increase in air pollution. More flights lead to larger, busier airports, which can significantly affect the communities surrounding them. The noise from increased air traffic can disturb the lives of residents, while the emissions produced create substantial health hazards. Burning aviation fuel releases considerable amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change and the greenhouse effect. The CO2 released by aircraft engines plays a significant role in the warming of our planet, posing a long-term threat to environmental stability.While it is essential to acknowledge the social and economic benefits of cheaper airfares, we must also confront the associated environmental costs. Policymakers and industry leaders must strive for a balance between making travel accessible and ensuring that such accessibility does not come at the expense of our planet's health. Initiatives such as investing in sustainable aviation technology, promoting carbon offset programs, and regulating flight frequencies could help mitigate the impact of increased air travel. Ultimately, the challenge lies in fostering a travel culture that prioritizes both human connection and environmental sustainability.
162;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;There are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town. The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner, quieter and often friendlier place to live. However, despite the advantages of small town life, I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons.On the one hand, I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area. To make it convenient, I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace. What's more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city.On the other hand, life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town. You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities. For instance, you can visit museums to learn history, and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading, or you can go to a sports center for exercising. But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs.Furthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information. If one can efficiently acquire the information, then, there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals. For example, there are various advertisements here an there, whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones. If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel, or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store, he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice. There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring. Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government, which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers. Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development. In conclusion, if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities, and have my children receive a better education, a big city is the place to live in.;Living in a small town has its distinct advantages, often characterized by strong community bonds, tranquility, and a slower pace of life. However, despite these appealing attributes, I firmly prefer the vibrant and dynamic environment of a big city for several compelling reasons.Firstly, proximity to employment opportunities is crucial in today's fast-paced world. In a big city, the abundance of companies and industries provides a greater likelihood of finding a job that aligns with my career aspirations. Moreover, living closer to work reduces commuting time, allowing for a better work-life balance. Instead of spending hours stuck in traffic or on public transport, I can dedicate more time to personal pursuits, relationships, and leisure activities.Additionally, big cities offer access to modern amenities that greatly enhance the quality of life. From cutting-edge healthcare facilities and diverse educational institutions to advanced public transport systems, these infrastructures are pivotal in maintaining a high standard of living. In urban areas, I can take advantage of numerous shops, restaurants, entertainment venues, and cultural experiences that are simply not available in smaller towns. This access to modern life caters to a variety of interests and lifestyles, allowing me to thrive in a more stimulating environment.Furthermore, city living provides exposure to a wealth of information and diverse perspectives. The fast-paced environment of a big city encourages continuous learning and engagement with a multitude of ideas and cultures. I can interact with people from various backgrounds, which broadens my understanding of the world and fosters personal growth. This constant stimulation keeps life interesting and invites opportunities for networking and collaboration.In conclusion, while small town life has its merits, the allure of big city living, characterized by job opportunities, modern conveniences, and rich exposure to diverse cultures and ideas, holds far more appeal for me. The vibrant, bustling atmosphere of a city ignites my passion for personal and professional development, making it the ideal place for me to thrive.
163;Salary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways to reward employees for good work. What other rewards for good work can be effective in encouraging further good work? Use specific examples to support your response.;It is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work. Besides the methods, from my point of view, providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work. My arguments for this point are listed follows.Firstly, training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind. Clearly, in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer, complaining from boss, etc. Therefore, we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends, joking in class, enjoying new knowledge.Secondly, employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained. In this case, the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company. So obviously, they will think about develop long term career with their company. For another thing, employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don't have this opportunity. Thirdly, providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge. Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business, so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result. Of course, excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss.In conclusion, providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages. Training can help employees refresh their mind as well as make them happy, focus on work. Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that training can be effective in encouraging further good work.;Salary increases and promotions have long been established as conventional methods to reward employees for their diligence and achievements within an organization. These financial incentives not only enhance employee satisfaction but also foster loyalty to the company. When an employee receives a raise or is promoted, it sends a strong message that their contributions are valued. This recognition boosts morale and encourages a culture of high performance, where individuals strive to meet and exceed expectations.However, while monetary rewards and titles are significant motivators, they are not the only ways to encourage continued excellence in the workplace. From my perspective, providing professional training stands out as an impactful strategy for rewarding employees and promoting long-term engagement. Unlike a one-time financial boost, skill development equips employees with the tools they need to succeed and grow within the organization. Training programs can enhance an individual's existing capabilities or introduce new skills that align with the company's evolving needs.Moreover, professional training demonstrates the organization's commitment to employee growth. When companies invest in their workforce, they create an environment of mutual respect and collaboration. Employees feel valued and recognized for their potential, inspiring them to take ownership of their roles and responsibilities. As they acquire new competencies, individuals may take the initiative for innovative projects or leadership roles, directly benefiting the organization as a whole.In conclusion, while salary increases and promotions remain essential components of employee recognition, integrating professional training into the reward system can yield significant advantages. By fostering an environment of continuous learning and development, companies not only motivate employees but also cultivate a highly skilled workforce prepared to meet future challenges. This holistic approach ultimately leads to a more dynamic and responsive organization.
164;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Attending university's classes is one of activities that students have to do. However, class is not the only source of knowledge. Students also learn from other sources such as experience, libraries and other people. I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons.Firstly, the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room. Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand. For example, I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university. She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast. Thus, she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic. Finally, she got very good grade when she was graduation.Secondly, students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well. In my experience, many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes. Also, I had already studied all biology topics before attending university. As a result, I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A+ for both biology and chemistry. In conclusion, I think the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time. Also, they have to know how to deal with the effects from not attending classes. So that, attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore.;The debate surrounding the necessity of mandatory class attendance in universities is becoming increasingly relevant in today's educational landscape. While traditional classroom instruction has its merits, it is essential to consider that attending classes should ultimately be optional for students. An array of alternative learning avenues exists that can often enhance students' understanding and mastery of subjects far beyond what a lecture hall can offer.One of the primary advantages of allowing students to choose whether to attend classes is the opportunity for self-directed learning. Many students excel when they take control of their education, pursuing topics that resonate with their interests and learning styles. With the abundance of online resources, such as videos, podcasts, and interactive course materials, students can access a wealth of knowledge from the comfort of their homes. These resources often provide different perspectives and methodologies that may illuminate complex concepts in a way that aligns better with an individual’s learning preferences.Moreover, libraries become invaluable spaces for students seeking to delve deeper into their subjects. By studying independently in a library, students can focus specifically on areas they find challenging without the pressure of keeping pace with a class. This tailored approach not only builds self-discipline but also fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as they must navigate texts, research, and resources alone.In conclusion, making class attendance optional empowers students to take ownership of their education. With various learning resources available, alongside the opportunity for independent study, students can tailor their educational experience to achieve maximum understanding and retention of the material. Ultimately, this flexibility supports a more engaged, self-reliant, and successful generation of graduates, prepared to navigate the complexities of the modern world.
165;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in?;In a few years I will finish my studying in the university and I will have to decide whether to live in a small town or a big city. As I am eager to get a good job and explore different places, I think I would prefer to live in a city.Big city life provides many opportunities. First of all, it will be easier for me to find an engineering job in the city. Electrical engineering deals with problems concerning electricity supply. Therefore, a big city can offer me many more vacancies than a small town.At the weekends, there is a great number of things to do in the metropolis. There are numerous bars, cafes and restaurants where I can go with my friends. Multinational cities have restaurants with different national cuisines. I am fond of Italian food, and if there is an Italian restaurant in the city, I will definitely visit it.A night club is an interesting place to visit for young people. There a person can listen to music, make new friends or enjoy a a drink alone. Cultural life of a metropolis is always an entertaining one. I am keen on museums and it would be a pleasure for me to spend several hours a week in front of famous paintings, sculptures or artifacts. On special dates, city offers free exhibitions which are available for everyone who is interested in art.What's more, cities have better medical facilities than in the countryside. This can at least assure me that if I feel bad, city can provide a high quality help. In conclusion, while small towns have picturesque nature and pure air, big cities offer countless amount of opportunities and entertainment places. Considering all the benefits, I would choose to live in a big city.;As I approach the final years of my university education, I find myself contemplating a significant decision that will shape my future: whether to reside in a small town or a big city after graduation. Each option presents its own set of advantages, but the allure of big city life stands out for several compelling reasons.Firstly, the career opportunities in a metropolitan area are particularly enticing for someone pursuing a degree in engineering. Big cities often serve as hubs for technological innovation and industrial growth, offering a plethora of job prospects in well-established firms and startups alike. This environment can provide not only ample job openings but also a chance to network with industry leaders and participate in cutting-edge projects, which is invaluable for a recent graduate.Secondly, the vibrant lifestyle that a big city offers is hard to resist. The metropolis boasts a wide array of entertainment options, from an eclectic mix of bars and cafes to world-class restaurants that cater to diverse tastes. This social landscape fosters a vibrant community where I can connect with friends and meet new people, engaging in activities that range from cultural events and concerts to outdoor festivals. The continuous stream of entertainment and the dynamic atmosphere of a city can enhance personal growth and enrich my overall living experience.Lastly, the superior medical facilities in urban areas cannot be overlooked. Access to high-quality healthcare services is crucial, especially as one navigates the uncertainties of young adulthood. Cities often house advanced hospitals and specialized medical centers that provide comprehensive care, ensuring that I can receive prompt attention and treatment when needed.In conclusion, while small towns offer charm and tranquility, the myriad opportunities provided by big cities—be it in terms of career prospects, social activities, or healthcare—make them a more appealing choice for my future endeavors. As I prepare to embark on this exciting new chapter, I am increasingly drawn to the vibrant life that urban environments have to offer.
166;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;The advent of the computer is one of the results of the development of the advantaged technology. While some people advocate for the idea that computers have made life more complex and stressful, others support the idea that computers have made life easier and more convenient. In my point of view, computers brought convenience and easiness to our life since they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication. First, computers through internet made our access to information easier. Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed. Search engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes. Social networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments. Hence, with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources. Second, in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper. With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes. In addition, it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world. Internet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible. For example, via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities. In result, communication has become cheaper, faster and visual. Finally, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient in the ways that it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways.;"The advent of the computer marks a significant milestone in the development of advanced technology, fundamentally transforming various aspects of our daily lives. From my perspective, computers have introduced unparalleled convenience and ease, primarily through enhanced access to information and improved communication.One of the most profound impacts of computers is the democratization of information. In the past, acquiring knowledge often required access to libraries, books, or specialized institutions, which could prove daunting and time-consuming. Today, with a few clicks, we can access a vast repository of information that spans virtually every subject imaginable. This accessibility not only enables individuals to educate themselves quickly but also fosters a culture of lifelong learning. The internet, powered by computers, has opened up horizons where students, professionals, and curious minds can explore topics of interest, thereby enhancing their understanding of the world.Moreover, the communication capabilities that computers offer have revolutionized the way we connect with others. In the digital age, instant messaging, video conferencing, and social media allow people to communicate effortlessly across geographical boundaries. Whether for personal interactions or professional networking, computers have made it possible to stay in touch with loved ones or collaborate with colleagues from different parts of the world. This immediate accessibility has also been instrumental during times of crisis, enabling timely dissemination of information and coordination of efforts.In conclusion, the arrival of computers is a hallmark of advanced technology that has profoundly influenced our lives. By facilitating easy access to information and enhancing communication, computers have created a more interconnected and informed society. The convenience they offer is not just a luxury; it has become an essential component of modern life, shaping how we learn, work, and connect with one another."
167;Computers and modems have made it possible for office workers to do their work from home instead of working in offices every day. Working from home should be encouraged for workers and employees as it is good. Do you agree or dis? ;Some people think that working at home brings to workers and employees too much convenience, but i don't. Because the best conditions are sometimes not likely to be good as the expectation of people. Working without pressure and interaction are some examples for these disadvantages.Pressure is motivation. Each office has its rules that keep workers do their job as effectively as possible. The directors manage employers and give them the deadline of projects. Then again, the workers must try their best to finish the time limit. Doing all jobs at home don't make employees attempt to work like this. Computers and modems bring works to home but these still have many things distract their mind. Facebook or Yahoo have been the entertaining websites, however, they are the reasons why people cannot concentrate on their job. The dos and don't at office play important role to prevent these things from workers. In condition, doing all jobs alone makes employees fall asleep easily. As a result, the project cannot being done. The best condition might not be good for people. Interaction has been an advantage for workers at offices. Discussing and debating Projects together increase working ability because all we know that the target can be reached fast thanks to working of many people. Besides, interaction help employees improve their communicational skills, therefore, they will have more and more friends and relationships. Interaction is a factor increasing working quality.There will have many disadvantages if the workers work at home. Mitigating process, no interaction and pressure are these things people should examine when they want to work at home.;"In recent years, the concept of working from home has gained significant traction, especially following the global shift instigated by the COVID-19 pandemic. While many argue that remote work offers unparalleled convenience and flexibility, I contend that the idealized view of home-based employment can often lead to unexpected challenges.One of the primary assumptions about working from home is that it alleviates the stress associated with commuting and rigid office hours. However, this convenience can quickly become a double-edged sword. The absence of a structured environment may blur the lines between personal and professional life, leading to increased fatigue and burnout. Without a designated workspace, employees may find it difficult to separate work duties from home responsibilities, ultimately diminishing their productivity. Moreover, remote work often lacks the essential elements of interpersonal interaction and collaborative dynamics present in a traditional office setting. The social aspect of workplace engagement fosters camaraderie, motivation, and creative brainstorming. When working in isolation, individuals may suffer from a lack of motivation, leading to feelings of loneliness and disconnection. This absence of face-to-face communication can hinder creativity and collaboration, resulting in a less engaging work experience and potentially lower-quality output.Lastly, while some individuals thrive without the immediate pressure of coworkers or supervisors, this lack of oversight can lead to complacency. The freedom of working at one’s own pace might sound appealing, but it can also create challenges in accountability and self-discipline. Pressure often serves as a catalyst for productivity; without it, deadlines may stretch endlessly, and tasks may be deprioritized.In conclusion, while working from home presents certain conveniences, it is essential to recognize the potential drawbacks that accompany these perceived advantages. The challenges of isolation, lack of structure, and diminished pressure could deter the very productivity and enthusiasm that employees seek. Therefore, it is crucial to find a balanced approach that combines the benefits of remote work with the invaluable interaction and structure of traditional office environments."
168;Some people think that a university professor should focus time on doing research, while others think that the main role of a professor is to educate students in a university. What is your opinion and why? Use specific reasons to support your answer.Ê;Nowadays, many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities. Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field, the research takes up too much teaching time. As far as I am concerned, professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research.To begin with, it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge. The professors’ duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses. If professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes. The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies. In this way, professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students. Therefore, professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research.On the other hand, if professors are busy in doing research, ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students, it would ruin the reputation of universities. Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course, and the enrollment of universities may decline. Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study. In this way, hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects. It is adverse to the whole academic field. Accordingly, spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors, rather than research.Nevertheless, professors could teach students through research and projects. Some students enjoy taking part in some research. Through to use the equipment and invent their own work, they may get more experience in the process of research. For instance, electronic students always invent new machines such as robots, MP3 and remote control car. They can manage the electric theory in practical skills. And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions. However, only under specific circumstance, when students master all of the systematic knowledge, can they accomplish research. This is requires professors provide high quality courses. In other word, professor should concern about preparing class.Consequently, conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent. However, the precondition of doing research is growing students’ solid theory fundamental. Only by developing students, can we have a better academic field. Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way.;The role of professors in universities encompasses various responsibilities, including teaching, research, and community engagement. While research is undeniably crucial in advancing knowledge and fostering innovation, I argue that professors should prioritize course preparation over research to uphold the quality of education and the reputation of the institution. The primary mission of universities is to educate students, equipping them with the knowledge and skills necessary for their future careers. When professors allocate excessive time to research, they risk neglecting the development of well-structured and relevant courses. Inadequate course preparation can lead to a disorganized curriculum and subpar student experiences, ultimately tarnishing the university's reputation. A strong educational foundation is essential for students, and it is the professors' duty to ensure that class materials are engaging, up-to-date, and comprehensive.However, it is essential to recognize that research and teaching are not mutually exclusive. Professors can integrate their research into the classroom, offering students the opportunity to learn through real-world applications. By involving students in projects and research activities, they can stimulate curiosity and foster a deeper understanding of the subject matter. This hands-on approach not only enhances the learning experience but also demonstrates the relevance of academic pursuits to actual societal issues.In conclusion, while research is an integral part of a professor's role, it should not overshadow the importance of course preparation. By prioritizing the development of engaging and effective courses, professors can significantly enhance the educational experience for students and help maintain the prestige of their institutions. Ultimately, a balanced approach that values both teaching and research will yield the best outcomes for students, professors, and universities alike.
169;Technological progress in the past century has its negative effect, despite its remarkable contribution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In the past few decades, there were many remarkable achievements in technology fields that have numbers of beneficial effects on the whole society or individuals, although bringing some disadvantages to us.On one hand, the development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards. Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools, which play an important role in economic activity. Because of the technology of internet and air transportation, businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions. This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue.Besides, advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard. With the improvement of medical technology, it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before, and many serious diseases are under control. Digital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies, and this means that we could get more happiness from technology.On the other hand, the development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society. People utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas, and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions. This would pose a large threat to the ecology and environment. Vehicle technology enables many people to drive private cars, and emission of exhaust gas could lead to air pollution in large cities.In conclusion, although technological progress causes corresponding problems, it still provides us with much more advantages.;The development of technology has undeniably played a pivotal role in driving economic growth and enhancing living standards across the globe. As societies advance through various technological innovations—from the industrial revolution to the digital age—productivity levels surge, allowing businesses to operate more efficiently. This efficiency fosters economic expansion, creates jobs, and increases income levels, which in turn improves the quality of life for many. Furthermore, advanced technology in sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, and services helps streamline operations, leading to reduced costs and increased accessibility of goods and services. Consequently, this proliferation of technology translates into improved living standards, as individuals gain greater access to resources and opportunities.Moreover, technological advancements have significantly impacted healthcare, leading to enhanced health outcomes and longevity. Innovations such as telemedicine, diagnostic tools, and advanced treatment options enable medical professionals to provide superior care and preventive measures. Telehealth solutions, for instance, allow patients to receive consultations remotely, thereby breaking down geographical barriers and making healthcare more accessible. Advanced medical devices and data analytics further empower healthcare systems to efficiently monitor and treat diseases, improving overall public health standards.However, the rapid pace of technological development also brings with it significant challenges. The environmental impact of manufacturing processes, electronic waste, and resource depletion poses a serious threat to ecosystems and biodiversity. Additionally, as technology creates new economic opportunities, it can exacerbate social inequalities, leaving certain demographics behind in the digital divide. The reliance on automation can lead to job displacement, creating societal tensions and economic disparities.In conclusion, while the development of technology can drive economic growth and elevate living standards and healthcare, it is crucial to address the potential negative repercussions on the environment and society. A balanced approach that promotes sustainable practices and equitable access to technology will be key in harnessing its benefits while mitigating adverse effects.
170;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state has evolved to encompass a broader and more nuanced understanding of health and well-being. Governments are now tasked not only with providing healthcare services but also with ensuring that their citizens have access to sustainable healthcare and comprehensive health education. This shift in focus is critical, as healthcare systems globally are under considerable strain, grappling with rising costs, an aging population, and the growing burden of chronic diseases. A welfare state that prioritizes prevention and education can lead to healthier populations, reduced healthcare costs, and improved quality of life.Sustainable healthcare is predicated on the principle that health services should be efficient, equitable, and able to meet the needs of the populace without depleting resources or jeopardizing future generations. Governments must invest in infrastructure that supports preventive care and promotes healthy lifestyles. This includes initiatives like vaccination programs, nutrition education campaigns, and mental health resources. Additionally, health education empowers individuals to make informed decisions about their health, fostering a culture of prevention rather than reaction.To effectively implement these strategies, we must also reconsider our budget allocations. A greater proportion of government spending should be directed toward education and prevention initiatives rather than solely focusing on treatment. By prioritizing initiatives that promote wellness and equip citizens with the knowledge they need to lead healthier lives, we can reduce reliance on costly medical treatments that might only address symptoms rather than underlying issues. In conclusion, a reimagined welfare state demands that governments take responsibility not only for treating the sick but also for fostering a healthier society through sustainable healthcare and robust health education. In doing so, they can allocate a larger share of their budgets to education and prevention, ultimately leading to a healthier, more resilient populace and sustainable health systems.
171;Students at a university often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.;Many students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages. After considering the level of freedom, the studying conditions and the economic factor, if I had to choose, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories.First, an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory. While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules, in the apartment you set your own rules. You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want. An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student. This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory.Second, from an economic point of view, people often argue that an apartment is more expensive. This is only partially true, you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper. Transportation is another issue, you have to go to and return from the university everyday. You could choose to use public transportation, a cheaper option, or to have a car. The car is an expensive option, but also offers freedom of schedule and destination.Lastly, the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don't have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories. A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times. Since in an apartment you don't have a roommate, you won't have this problem, and as a result you would be able to concentrate better. For the same reason, you won't have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music, bring friends over, or study late at night. You set your own schedules. In the other hand, living in a dormitory, and being surrounded by students also has some advantages, like being able to get help with any academic issues from them. To conclude, both options have their advantages, but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory.;Choosing a place to live while attending university is a decision that many students grapple with. Two primary options are living in university dormitories or renting an apartment in the city. Each of these choices carries its own set of advantages and disadvantages, and the ideal option often varies from student to student based on personal preferences and circumstances.Living in a dormitory offers numerous benefits, particularly the sense of community it fosters. Students can easily make friends, participate in organized events, and benefit from the convenience of being close to their classes and campus facilities. Additionally, dorm living typically includes meals and utilities within the rental cost, which may simplify budgeting. However, dormitories also come with limitations, such as shared spaces and restrictions on personal freedom, which can be challenging for students accustomed to living independently.On the other hand, renting an apartment in the city offers a greater degree of freedom and privacy. Students have the ability to decorate their space as they wish, cook their meals, and establish their own routines. This independence can be beneficial for personal growth and self-management. Additionally, city living often provides access to a wider array of resources, such as bookstores, cafes, and entertainment. However, apartments can be more expensive, involving costs like utilities and groceries that dorm living typically covers.After weighing the level of freedom, study conditions, and economic factors, I would personally prefer living in an apartment. The independence it affords would allow me to create a focused study environment, manage my own schedule, and enjoy a lifestyle that aligns more closely with my personal preferences. While dorm life has its merits, the benefits of city living would ultimately enhance my overall university experience.
173;Some movies are serious, designed to make the audience think. Other movies are designed primarily to amuse and entertain. Which type of movie do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"I prefer the serious movies which are simple, touching and powerful. Here are my reasons. First, most serious movies have a wide variety of content. Entertaining movies are created to amuse people. However, most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical. Compared with the entertainment film, the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful. Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love, humaneness; moreover, it may point out the dark sides of the society.Second, not all of serious movies are boring. ""Click"" is a very interesting comedy, with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses. The movie is humorous and satiric,which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives, and it reminds us how important our families are. Thus, the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves.Moreover, some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world. ""Blood diamond"", an adaptation of a real story in South Africa, focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict. After watching the movie, we may learn a lesson between jewels and death. Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love; indeed, the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality. As a result, serious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way.For the above reasons, I prefer to see those serious movies which make people have deep thoughts toward their real lives.";"""Click"" is a captivating comedy that serves a deeper purpose beyond mere entertainment. While it employs humor and comedy to engage its audience, the film also delivers a poignant message about the significance of maintaining a balanced life between family and work responsibilities. The protagonist, played by Adam Sandler, finds himself in a whirlwind of career-driven success, often overlooking the essential elements of his personal life. Through a fantastical remote control that allows him to fast-forward through mundane moments, the film cleverly juxtaposes the pursuit of professional success with the irreplaceable value of family.One of the most fascinating aspects of ""Click"" is its ability to blend comedic elements with serious undertones. While many comedies may lean toward lightheartedness, ""Click"" takes a unique approach by exploring weighty themes such as love and human connection. The protagonist’s journey highlights the dark sides of modern society—where work often takes precedence over familial relationships, leading to an unfulfilled life. Each use of the remote serves as a reminder of the moments missed, the laughter unshared, and the relationships neglected in the quest for business achievements.Moreover, the film provokes reflection on how societal pressures encourage individuals to prioritize work over personal well-being and the essential bonds that make life meaningful. As the protagonist grapples with the repercussions of his choices, viewers are invited to consider their own lives and the importance of finding equilibrium between their professional aspirations and the nurturing of personal relationships.In conclusion, ""Click"" is much more than a simple comedy; it is a thoughtful exploration of the human experience. By intertwining humor with serious themes, it effectively emphasizes the necessity of a balanced life, urging audiences to appreciate the beautiful moments that often go unnoticed amidst the hustle and bustle of work life."
174;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines, and other media pay too much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;As a mass media majoring student, I think that it's true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society. In my point of view, disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages. My reasons include the following:It is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people. The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip. However, journalism is changing. Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues, paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people.First of all, gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion. The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports, which seems to tell a story. Moreover, it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported.Furthermore, sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems. The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content, which can attract the audience. Thus, these personal reports of famous people, unimportant information or distorted stories, will not solve problem related with the society. In other words, yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news, such as education, environment and public issues.Based on the above discussion, I agree with that paying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem.;In my point of view, the disadvantages of overemphasizing the personal lives of famous individuals by the media outweigh any potential advantages. While celebrity gossip might seem entertaining and provides some economic benefits to the media industry, the implications it has on society are far more negative.Firstly, much of the gossip surrounding celebrities often involves misleading images and narratives, crafted strategically to boost newspaper sales or generate clicks online. The focus on scandalous stories, rather than factual reporting, distorts public perception and creates a culture where the truth is secondary. This superficial consumption of information not only misrepresents the individuals involved but also contributes to the spread of misinformation, leading audiences to form opinions based on sensationalized or fabricated accounts rather than on their real lives or accomplishments.Furthermore, the relentless obsession with the personal lives of famous people serves as a form of distraction from more pressing public and social issues. When media outlets devote significant airtime and pages to celebrity affairs, legal troubles, or fashion choices, they effectively divert attention away from critical topics such as poverty, climate change, and political corruption. This sensationalism creates a society that is more invested in entertainment than in informed citizenship, reducing our capacity to engage with and address systemic problems.Moreover, this focus on celebrities can have detrimental effects on public discourse, as it promotes a culture of voyeurism that prioritizes sensational over substantial conversations. The constant scrutiny and judgment cast on public figures perpetuate a toxic culture that encourages ridicule rather than understanding, impacting not only the celebrities themselves but also the audience that consumes these narratives.In conclusion, while the coverage of famous individuals may provide fleeting entertainment, the consequences of overemphasizing their personal lives by the media—misleading narratives and distraction from social problems—far outweigh any advantages. It would be beneficial for the media to redirect its focus toward more meaningful content that enriches public understanding and fosters constructive dialogues.
175;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As a lover of travel, a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour, which can be explained by the following reasons.Primary, it is easy to know the history of the new place. Last year, I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum, where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York. Through the exhibit, I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom, and Ellis Island may be the place, where the immigration took their dreams and fears. Thus, museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place.Secondary, visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon. Those outstanding and diverse range of objects,with classic and magnificent art, is guaranteed to inspire us! In my city, National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts. To my astonishment, Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work, which is made of jade, is vividly shown.Moreover, a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit. Someone take a trip without making any plans, so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel. As a result, visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision. Most important of all, a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time.For the above reasons, if we have a chance to visit top museums in the world, we must stop by these museums. During our trip, it is worthwhile for us to visit a museum of a new place.;"As a lover of travel, one of the quintessential experiences during any journey is a visit to an exceptional museum. Museums serve as vibrant portals into the past, offering a structured glimpse into the history and customs of a new place. When I step into a museum, I am not merely an observer; I am a participant in a narrative that spans generations and cultures.Primarily, museums are crucial because they allow visitors to grasp the rich tapestry of a region's history. They house artifacts, artworks, and exhibits that narrate the story of the people who have inhabited those lands. For instance, visiting the Louvre in Paris reveals not only the splendor of French art but also the evolution of European cultural identity. Each piece tells a story, whether it be a classic painting or an ancient sculpture, allowing me to understand the values, struggles, and aesthetics of the society that produced them. This immersion into the local narrative enriches my travel experience, fostering a deeper connection to the place.Secondly, exploring a well-known museum significantly broadens our horizons. It exposes us to diverse perspectives and ideas that may be alien to our own cultural background. Consider the British Museum, where artifacts from various civilizations coexist, inviting visitors to draw parallels and contrasts between different histories. By engaging with these collections, I not only learn about distant cultures but also challenge my own preconceived notions. This dialogue between cultures can inspire empathy and understanding—a vital aspect of modern global citizenship.In summary, visiting a well-curated museum during my travels is an irreplaceable experience. Through deep explorations of history and the broadening of my perspectives, museums enrich my understanding and appreciation of our shared human journey, making them an essential stop on any tour."
176;In the future, students may have the choice of studying at home by using technology such as computer or television or studying or traditional school? Which would you prefer? Use specific details to explain your choice.;"I don't think that technology can replace teachers and classroom. Here are my reasons. Studying at home by using technology is convenient. The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day. In addition, you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course. You can study any time you want. However, if you aren't extremely dedicated or have good time management skills, it may be very difficult to complete a course at home.First, attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience. Especially when you don't have an instructor there to guide you, it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements. Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects. Unfortunately, it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help. Second, studying at home is very different from traditional learning. Unlike traditional classes, distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates. Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision. If you are the type that gets easily distracted, a distance-learning program may not be for you.Furthermore, there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization- establishes relationship with classmates. We can learn a lot from programs at home; however, our computers or televisions can't teach us how to get along with people. For example, students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork. Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities. For the above reasons, I agree that distance education can't replace traditional school.";The rise of technology has fundamentally transformed the landscape of education, making studying at home an increasingly convenient option. Distance education courses allow students to access a vast array of resources from the comfort of their homes, offering flexibility that traditional classrooms cannot provide. However, while the convenience of studying at home is undeniable, many students encounter significant challenges that can hinder their educational experience. One of the most prominent difficulties of completing a course remotely is the lack of direct interaction with teachers and peers. In traditional educational settings, students thrive in an environment rich with social interaction. Lessons take place in physical classrooms where students can engage in discussions, collaborate on projects, and benefit from immediate feedback from their instructors. In contrast, distance education often lacks these vital elements, leaving learners to navigate their studies largely in isolation. Moreover, the socialization that occurs in traditional schools plays a crucial role in the overall development of young individuals. Building relationships with classmates fosters teamwork, communication skills, and emotional intelligence. These interpersonal skills are essential in both academic and professional settings, as they enhance one’s ability to collaborate effectively and navigate complex social environments. Computers and televisions may serve as excellent tools for delivering content, but they cannot replicate the nuanced learning experiences gained through real-life interactions.In conclusion, while studying at home through technology provides undeniable convenience, it also presents significant hurdles that can affect a student's success. The lack of a classroom environment restricts socialization opportunities, which are essential for developing interpersonal skills. Therefore, it is essential for educators and learners to recognize the importance of balancing technology-driven education with the invaluable experiences that traditional classroom settings offer.
177;It has recently been announced that a large shopping center may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;I believe that it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community. The following are my reasons.In the first place, the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping. Here is a positive example: Queens Center Mall, a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City, provides a wide vairtey of stores, products and services, from clothing to electronics and restaurants, that consumers can choose. It is widely thought that it is one of the most productive malls in New York. I found that I could find virtually every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney, when I visited there. As far as I am concerned, a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time.Furthermore, it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs. There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall. It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job. Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money.Lastly, it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center, and save our time on the other hand. There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers. Accordingly, with sales promotion, it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy. In addition, the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes.For the above-mentioned reasons, I advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to our community.;The establishment of a large shopping center can significantly enhance the shopping experience for residents, offering convenience, variety, and economic advantages. As urban areas grow and populations increase, the demand for accessible shopping options becomes more critical. A centralized shopping hub provides an easy and cohesive place for community members to meet their retail needs without having to travel long distances to multiple stores.One of the primary benefits of a shopping center is the convenience it offers. With a diverse range of shops located in one location, residents can accomplish their errands in a single trip, eliminating the hassle of visiting several standalone stores. This not only saves time but also encourages more frequent shopping due to the ease of access. Families and individuals alike can effectively manage their schedules, balancing work, home, and leisure activities, while still having the opportunity to shop effortlessly.In addition to convenience, residents may also find that goods are often priced lower in shopping centers. Retailers at these centers can benefit from economies of scale, leading to lower operating costs and competitive pricing strategies. With multiple stores vying for customers’ attention, consumers are more likely to encounter promotions and discounts, driving prices down even further. This competitive environment encourages shoppers to explore different options, ultimately leading to better bargains.Moreover, the ability to save both time and money significantly enhances the overall shopping experience. Consumers can make more informed purchasing decisions and enjoy the act of shopping without the stress associated with crowded city centers or remote locations. The establishment of a large shopping center serves not only as a retail hub but also as a social gathering place, enriching the local community's lifestyle.In conclusion, the benefits of a large shopping center are manifold. By providing a convenient, cost-effective, and diverse shopping experience, it greatly enhances the lives of residents while fostering a sense of community.
178;What is a very important skill a person should learn in order to be successful in the world today? Choose one skill and use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;"Some people think that life is a struggle, which means we may encounter numerous difficulties during our lives. Accordingly, stress management, how to survive our unbearable stress, is the most important skill that we should have. Here are my reasons. Stress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences. Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success. However, it is widely thought that we experience stress any time, which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals. As a result, if we don't have a good stress management skill, it may lead to some critical problems.In the frenetic, fast-paced world, it is a very common predicament that all of us, from the young to the senior, feel depressed caused by stress, such as financial problems, exam stress, relationship difficulties and work overload. Some people regard stress as a power, which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best; other people cannot charge of their thoughts, emotions, and the way they deal with problems. Therefore, stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization.Furthermore, stress takes a toll on our health. It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles, frustrations, and demands. This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress. Thus, some people have physical problems, such as insomnia and headaches. Melancholia, the most fatal problem, even leads some people to commit suicide. Consequently, it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body. To avoid being a pessimist, we may try to conquer our distress by sharing our worry with friends or families, doing exercise regularly, and trying to see our troubles in a different way.For the above reasons, I believe that stress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress.";"Stress is an inherent aspect of human life, functioning as our body’s natural response to various demands or challenges we face in everyday situations. It is an adaptive mechanism, designed to prepare us for action; however, it can manifest from both positive and negative experiences. For instance, while the excitement of a new job can trigger stress, so can the pressures associated with it. The paradox lies in the fact that while some level of stress can be motivational, too much of it can lead to debilitating consequences for our mental and physical health.In today’s frenetic, fast-paced world, stress has become a ubiquitous phenomenon affecting individuals of all ages, from children to the elderly. The relentless pursuit of success, coupled with societal expectations, often leads to overwhelming feelings of anxiety and depression. For the young, academic pressures and social media influences significantly contribute to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. Senior citizens, on the other hand, grapple with different stressors such as health concerns, financial limitations, and social isolation. The impact of stress is profound, influencing not only individual well-being but also relationships and productivity. Chronic stress can lead to serious health issues, including cardiovascular problems, weakened immune responses, and mental health disorders like depression and anxiety. Recognizing and managing stress is crucial for healthy living; practices such as mindfulness, regular exercise, and strong social support systems can help mitigate its effects. In conclusion, while stress is a universal experience that can arise from both positive and negative circumstances, it is imperative to address its implications on mental and physical health. Understanding how to cope with stress is essential in navigating the complexities of life in an increasingly demanding world, ensuring we maintain our well-being at every stage of life."
179;Groups or organizations are an important part of some people's lives. Why are groups or organizations important to people? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;"During our life, it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations; therefore, groups and organizations are an important part of their lives. In my point of view, groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals. My reasons include the following:In the first place, humans are a part of the society, and the society includes a wide variety of groups. Most of all, the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults. We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life. By making teamwork, the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others. As university students, it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others. After graduating from schools, employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits. Thus, almost of us live in the environment of groups.By participating in an organization, it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose. A solid group can be a suited environment, which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons. For example, as a student majoring in mass media, I have taken part in mass media student group for a year. When being in the department of art, I have not only learned how to do a project, but also known some famous artists during the term. Above all, it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job.Furthermore, groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal. Here is an example: there are various charities in the world. Tzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan, is famous for contributing to the social and community services, and medical care. They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit. For accomplishing their missions, the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks. As a result, they lit the light for the poor and victims; in addition, they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world. For the above reasons and examples, it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds.";Groups and organizations serve as pivotal platforms that facilitate personal growth, skill acquisition, and the achievement of collective goals. From childhood through adulthood, engagement in groups significantly influences socialization, shaping individuals’ beliefs, behaviors, and social skills. These collective settings create a support system that encourages members to interact, share experiences, and learn from one another.In childhood, groups such as schools and clubs are foundational in teaching essential social skills like teamwork, communication, and empathy. As children participate in various activities, they gain valuable experience navigating social dynamics, which invariably shapes their character and worldview. This initial engagement in groups lays the groundwork for more complex interactions in adolescence and adulthood, where the importance of collaboration expands to include professional environments and community organizations.Moreover, solid groups cultivate an environment conducive to self-improvement and broadened horizons. Through shared objectives and cooperative efforts, individuals can transcend personal limitations and engage in collective problem-solving. This dynamic not only propels personal growth but also enhances community cohesion, fostering a sense of belonging and commitment among members. For instance, clubs focused on hobbies, sports teams, or volunteer organizations provide participants with opportunities to explore new interests and develop skills that may be invaluable in their professional lives.In addition to skill development, groups expose individuals to diverse perspectives and backgrounds. This exposure is crucial in today’s global society, where understanding different cultures and ideologies fosters tolerance and inclusivity. Such interactions enrich personal experiences and empower individuals to contribute positively to society.In conclusion, groups and organizations are essential in facilitating personal and social development. They provide individuals with opportunities to gain experiences, achieve goals, and engage in meaningful interactions, ultimately shaping them into well-rounded members of society.
180;The government has announced that it plans to build a new university. Some people think that your community would be a good place to locate the university. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a new university in your community. Use specific details in your discussion;I will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community. There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies, creation of jobs. However, they come together with some disadvantages such as social problems.This new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study. For example, suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family. If you would like to attend a business school, you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university. He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community's university.Undoubtedly, the university will have to hire professors, employees and etc. Thus, a number vacant positions need to be filled. Also there will be more opportunities to work in the community. Moreover, when people have jobs, they will have money to spend on goods and services. This can also help stimulate the local economy. However, building the university may lead to some social problems. A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university. When many people congregate in one place, I think that some kinds of social problems will follow. Traffic may worsen. More wastes have to be managed. Maybe crime rate will also increase. These social problems may impair the quality of life in the community. In sum, I myself agree with the plan to build the university. I believe the benefit from it will outweigh the cost. However, it would be indispensable that the government conduct a survey about the community opinion on the new university first.;The establishment of a new university in our community, as proposed by the government, presents a multifaceted opportunity laden with both advantages and disadvantages. The prospect of a local institution of higher learning holds significant promise, primarily in enhancing educational access for residents. With a university nearby, individuals from diverse backgrounds will have increased opportunities to pursue higher education, which can lead to improved employment prospects and economic advancement. This heightened accessibility can serve as a catalyst for lifelong learning, allowing people of all ages to enhance their skill sets and adapt to changing job markets.Moreover, the introduction of a university can foster a vibrant academic culture within the community. Not only would it attract students from different regions, but it can also catalyze innovation and collaboration. Local businesses may benefit from partnerships with the university, tapping into research and development initiatives that could lead to new products and services. Additionally, young people who have previously left the area for education might choose to return, bringing fresh ideas and enthusiasm back to their home community.However, the development of a university is not without its drawbacks. The influx of students can lead to social challenges, such as increased housing demand, which may drive up rents and displace long-standing residents. Additionally, with a larger student population, there may be a rise in social issues, including noise complaints, littering, and potential strain on local infrastructure and services. Without proper planning and community engagement, these issues can lead to tensions between residents and students.In conclusion, while the government's plan to build a new university in our community presents numerous advantages—such as improved educational opportunities and economic stimulation—it is essential to acknowledge and address the accompanying challenges. Thoughtful planning and community collaboration will be crucial to ensuring that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, creating a harmonious environment that supports both lifelong learners and the existing community.
181;While some pelple believe that the government should provide a college education free to any citizen who wants it, others beleve that it is up to the individual to finance his/her own education.Ê;"Some people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college. However, I believe that individuals should pay their college tuition because it would cost too much, the college education is a personal's choice, and there are many ways to fund a college education. First, making college education free would cost too much. It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement, infrastructure and so forth. There are many other needs which should come first, such as providing health care to all American, or improving public schools. In addition, it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education. Consequently, it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds. Second, it is a personal choice to go to a college. Not everyone wants to go to a college. People who want to make more money, and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education. Therefore, those people should make the financial investment in their own choice; not the government.Third, there are many ways to fund a college education. People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship, financial aids, and other funds. In addition, the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means. They often provide services such as fire departments, medical assistance, and police protection for the schools and their students. They also provide funds for academic research. While the money is not given to individual students, these contributions are not trivial. In short, the individual should finance his or her education because it is a personal choice. Otherwise, it would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the government.";"The debate surrounding government coverage of college tuition is a contentious one, with opinions typically polarized. Some advocate for an educational system funded by the government, arguing that it promotes equal opportunities for all citizens. However, I firmly believe that individuals should bear the responsibility for their college tuition costs. This perspective is grounded in both economic considerations and the principle of personal choice.Firstly, the financial implications of providing free college education to all citizens are significant. Covering tuition and additional expenses for every individual seeking higher education would place an enormous burden on the government's budget. This funding would not appear from thin air; it would inevitably necessitate an increase in taxes, disproportionately affecting those who may not even utilize college education. Ongoing tax hikes could become a regular fixture, eroding public trust and creating resentment among taxpayers who feel their hard-earned money is being misappropriated.Moreover, education should be viewed as a personal investment rather than a societal obligation. When individuals pay for their education, they are more likely to value the experience and take their studies seriously. This personal investment encourages students to treat their education as a means to fruition in their career aspirations, instilling a sense of accountability and dedication. Additionally, the choice to pursue further education should remain an individual decision, reflective of personal ambitions and vocational goals. Not every career necessitates a college degree, and emphasizing personal responsibility allows individuals to explore various paths, including vocational training or apprenticeships that may better suit their circumstances.In conclusion, while the idea of government-funded college tuition may seem appealing, it introduces economic challenges and undermines the principle of personal accountability. Ultimately, individuals should bear the responsibility for their educational expenses, fostering a more sensible and sustainable approach to higher education."
182;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"We all know that television provides us many benefits; it helps people relax, helps keep up with news, helps broad our mind. However, have you ever thought that television has destroyed communication among friends and family? I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us.First of all, since people watch television too much, they can be isolated from others. Children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others. Gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying.Secondly, with the rapid change of the standard of life, each family has three or four TV in each room is more common. Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room. As a consequence, children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents. Moreover, parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children. In this way, communication between family members is visibly destroyed.Last but not least, watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human. For example, watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing. What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does? is this one of the reason cause division in society?In conclusion, though television has some good sides, it has destroyed communication among friends and family. We need to quickly find the way to address this problem as soon as possible and the first concern is to reducing violent behaviors that children learn from television.";Television is often regarded as a double-edged sword in modern society. On one hand, it offers numerous benefits that enhance our daily lives. For instance, television provides a valuable source of entertainment, allowing individuals to unwind after a long day. Engaging with various shows, movies, and documentaries can help people escape their worries, if only temporarily, providing much-needed relaxation. Furthermore, television serves as a critical medium for keeping up with current events, offering news updates and informative programs that inform the public about global issues. Additionally, it can broaden our perspectives by introducing viewers to different cultures, ideas, and ways of life through diverse programming.However, while television has numerous advantages, it is essential to consider its potentially destructive impact on communication, particularly among friends and family. The excessive consumption of TV can lead to a decline in interpersonal interactions as individuals become more engrossed in their screens rather than engaging with the people around them. This shift in focus can result in diminished quality time spent with loved ones, eroding the foundation of communication that is crucial for maintaining strong relationships.Moreover, television has a significant influence on children, who often learn behaviors and social cues from what they observe on screen rather than from their parents or guardians. The portrayal of relationships, communication styles, and moral lessons in TV shows can shape a child's understanding of the world, sometimes leading to unrealistic expectations and misunderstandings. As a result, valuable lessons about empathy, conversation, and shared experiences may take a backseat, ultimately hindering personal relationships.In conclusion, while television undoubtedly enriches our lives in many ways, it also poses risks to communication and the development of social skills, particularly in younger audiences. Striking a balance between screen time and meaningful interpersonal interaction is crucial in fostering healthy relationships in an increasingly digital world.
183;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Attending a live performance (a play, concert, sporting event, etc) is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Have you ever traveled along to support your home football team during tournaments? Have you attended at a stadium to watch your team's match, yell or even cry with the team and their thousands of fans there? If you have a great love with football and your home team, it is much more gratifying to stay side by side and cheer up the team at the stadium rather than just to stay at home and watch the match alone.First, attending a live football match is very fulfilling. Before the match starts, thousands of fans gathering outside of the stadium with team flags, colorful outfits, sound of trumpets and rattles... everywhere. As the game kicks off, the atmosphere inside the stadium is even more exciting. You are watching football stars play the game with your own eyes and sharing your feelings with about 40,000 people at the stadium, such an excitement you can never have when you are watching it at home. Everybody yells and sings together, the stadium is like bursted out whenever a goal is scored. See, you will be bored if you are watching it alone.Second, watching a live football game is an exceptional experience. You can watch it at home, but ""easy come, easy go"", you will quickly forget it, like a movie. The tickets to get in the stadium may be a little expensive, but you will gain much more entertainment value from the game. You can cherish your experience for a long time. Furthermore, it can be an exclusive experience. If it is a crucial win to acclaim a trophy, you will be ""on site"" to witness and celebrate the victory.In conclusion, watch a football match on television it is comfortable and pleasing, but watching the match live at the stadium is more enjoyable. It can be unforgettable moments in your life.";"Attending a live football match is one of the most exhilarating experiences for any passionate fan. The thrill of being in the stadium, side by side with fellow supporters, creates an atmosphere that simply cannot be replicated at home. The excitement of watching your favorite football stars perform in real-time, under the bright stadium lights, is both fulfilling and unforgettable.When you step into the stadium, the energy is palpable. The roar of the crowd, the chants of passionate fans, and the sight of your home team’s colors all around you create a sense of belonging and connection that television cannot offer. With approximately 40,000 other fans around you, your joys and disappointments during the match become collective experiences. You feel every goal, every near miss, and every referee's decision deeply, as the shared emotions amplify the intensity of the game.While it is true that purchasing tickets for a live match can be somewhat expensive, the entertainment value derived from the experience far outweighs the costs. The price of a ticket is not merely for a seat; it is an investment in memories that will last a lifetime. The adrenaline rush as the teams line up, the suspense as the crowd holds its breath during a penalty, and the ecstatic euphoria of a last-minute goal all contribute to a sense of fulfillment that viewing from home can hardly match.In contrast, watching a game alone on your couch can feel isolating. The intimate atmosphere of a packed stadium transforms the football experience into a communal celebration. Therefore, for true football lovers, being present at the stadium is an irreplaceable tradition, turning the act of watching a game into a shared adventure that resonates with the heart and soul of the sport."
184;Renewable resources of energy (Sun, wind, water) will soon replace fossils fuels such as gases, oil, and coal. Do you agree or disagree?;"Although renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy, as far as I'm concerned, these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal.Firstly, due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive. Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford. On the other hand, fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas. For example, it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms. Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming.Besides, although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think. Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards. For example, the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams. This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds. More importantly, the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations. Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think.Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions. For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain. These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy. With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable.In conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound, there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon.";Renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, hydro, and biomass, have become integral components of modern energy strategies aimed at achieving sustainability and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As the world grapples with the dire consequences of climate change, the shift towards renewable resources is seen as an essential step for both current and future energy policies. However, despite their potential benefits, it is my contention that these new forms of energy cannot quickly replace traditional fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal, primarily due to technological limitations and economic factors.One of the core challenges in transitioning to renewable energy is the current state of technology. While advancements have been made, many renewable energy systems, such as solar panels and wind turbines, still face efficiency hurdles. The technology to store energy generated from these sources, particularly during periods of low production, remains underdeveloped. For instance, battery storage solutions are improving, but they are not yet at a point where they can consistently and cost-effectively support large-scale energy demands. This intermittent energy supply makes it challenging to rely solely on renewables for base load power—an issue that can lead to instability in energy grids.Moreover, the cost associated with deploying renewable energy technologies is a significant barrier. While prices for solar and wind energy have decreased in recent years, the initial investment remains relatively high compared to the established infrastructure for fossil fuels. Many countries have heavy investments in oil, gas, and coal, which complicates the transition process. Furthermore, the economic implications for industries dependent on fossil fuels cannot be overlooked, as a rapid shift could lead to job losses and economic instability in regions reliant on traditional energy sources.In conclusion, while renewable energy resources are vital for the future and play a role in combating climate change, they currently cannot replace fossil fuels swiftly due to technological limitations and economic challenges. A balanced and gradual transition that incorporates both energy types may be the most pragmatic approach in resolving our energy needs while ensuring economic stability.
185;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree this point of view? Why or why not. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important. The reasons are based on the following aspects.First, land used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society. There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy, because they produce plenty of profits. What is more, the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry. It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate. Thus the needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.Second, farmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life. It is clearly understood that farming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live. Especially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing. In addition, highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life. Last I want to mention is that even though farmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals, it can do good to protect the endangered animals. According to the discuss above, agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy. With the economy development, we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals. For instant, we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct.All in all, protecting endangered animals is necessary, nevertheless, human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.;In contemporary discussions regarding land use, a prevailing opinion suggests that human needs for farmland, housing, and industrial development are prioritized over the preservation of land for endangered animals. Proponents of this view argue that the imperatives of supporting human life and societal growth outweigh the necessity of conserving natural habitats. This perspective is grounded in several key arguments.Firstly, the utilization of land for agriculture, housing, and industrial purposes is often seen as more beneficial to society as a whole. Agriculture is fundamental to feeding the burgeoning global population. By expanding farmland, we can ensure food security and meet the increasing demands of consumers. Additionally, real estate development can provide affordable housing solutions in urban areas, addressing the pressing issue of homelessness and improving living conditions for many. Industrial development, on the other hand, plays a crucial role in enhancing economic growth and infrastructure, which can ultimately elevate the standard of living for countless individuals.Secondly, expanding farmland and industries can create numerous job opportunities, directly impacting employment rates and, consequently, crime rates. As new agricultural projects are established and industries flourish, the demand for labor increases. This expansion allows for substantial employment growth, which can effectively diminish the unemployment rate. Lower unemployment often correlates with reduced crime rates, as individuals gain stability and purpose through gainful employment. This cycle of economic opportunity is critical in fostering safer communities and enhancing overall societal well-being.In conclusion, while the importance of preserving habitats for endangered animals is undeniable, the argument for prioritizing human needs reflects an immediate concern for societal development and welfare. Emphasizing land for agriculture, housing, and industry can lead to enhanced quality of life, job creation, and economic stability, which are essential for societal progress in an ever-evolving world.
186;Some people think that learning a foreign language in its original country is more beneficial than learning the language in a countr with another language. Do you agree or disagree?;Although there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country, I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries.Person 'A' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method. In other words, he is not jumping into the foreign country. Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language. Besides, all the learners are probably from the same country, so all these people most likely have learned the language, more or less, in the same way.On the other hand, when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken, he has the opportunity to communicate with natives. He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country. No doubt, it leads to better understanding of language essential skills. He also has access to the most up-to-date language. Thus he can learn most useful idioms, proverbs and so many other things which the former person, person 'A', does not have access to.On the whole, if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel, I would definitely make the second choice. There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language. When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language, you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible.In a word, although each of these methods have their pros and cons, I am pretty sure that advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language.;Learning a foreign language is an enriching experience that extends beyond mastering vocabulary and grammar rules. The context in which a language is learned significantly influences the learner's comprehension and proficiency. Individuals who immerse themselves in a language by learning it in the country where it is spoken often gain a deeper understanding of various language skills compared to those who study it in their native countries.One of the primary advantages of learning a language in its native environment is the opportunity for real-time practice and immersion. When learners, such as person 'A', study a non-native language in its country of origin, they are continuously exposed to the language in everyday settings—such as restaurants, shops, and community interactions. This dynamic practice helps in the acquisition of slang, idiomatic expressions, and cultural nuances that are often overlooked in traditional classroom settings. Such contextual learning not only aids in rapid vocabulary acquisition but also enhances listening skills as learners engage with native speakers.Conversely, while person 'A' might benefit from a structured, step-by-step teaching method in their own country, this approach can sometimes lack the spontaneity and authenticity that arise from immersion. Classrooms often utilize textbooks and audio-visual aids, which may not fully capture the living language's vibrancy. While systematic learning is essential for building foundational skills, it may result in a more mechanical understanding of the language, devoid of the emotional and cultural connections fostered in immersive environments.In conclusion, while structured language programs have their merits, the depth of understanding acquired through immersion in the native context is unparalleled. For learners eager to truly grasp a foreign language, experiencing it in its cultural habitat can lead to a more profound and holistic mastery of both the language and the culture it represents.
187;Some people say that physical exercise should be required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with?;"Although some people believe that students should spend the whole day on academic studies, I nevertheless believe that physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day. Exercise is good not only for having a good health body, but also for the mind. In addition, including exercise in children's daily routine, it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age.Physical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier. As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year, it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school. In addition, exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular, higher blood and cholesterol issues.Daily exercise will help also to develop children's brain function. It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better. When people exercise, the respiratory system's function is enhanced, helping all organs, including the brain, to get more oxygen in. Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners.Having children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine. Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity; however, they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice. Moreover, they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life. Including physical activity in children's school day should be strongly considered. It will meliorate not only mental and body health, but also will establish in children a habit of doing it, giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules.";"Exercise is a cornerstone of not only physical health but also mental wellness. The benefits of regular physical activity extend far beyond a fit body; it plays a crucial role in enhancing brain function, particularly in children. Engaging in daily exercise stimulates various cognitive processes, promoting improved concentration, better memory retention, and enhanced problem-solving skills. As children engage in physical activities, their brains release endorphins and other neurotransmitters that enhance their mood and reduce feelings of anxiety and depression, fostering a robust mental state.Incorporating exercise into children’s daily routines from an early age instills the important value of physical activity as a non-negotiable part of life. By establishing this habit early on, children develop a sense of discipline that can be beneficial in multiple aspects of their lives, including academics. Physical education, team sports, or simple outdoor play are essential components of their social and emotional development. These activities promote teamwork, communication, and cooperation, equipping children with skills that transcend the playground.Moreover, the impact of physical activity on children’s brain development cannot be overstated. Research suggests that regular exercise promotes neurogenesis, the process of forming new neurons in the brain, especially in the hippocampus, an area critical for learning and memory. Consequently, children who engage in regular physical activity may exhibit improved academic performance and better behavioral outcomes in school settings.In conclusion, fostering a culture of exercise among children is vital. It not only contributes to their physical well-being but also supports healthy brain development. By incorporating daily exercise into their routines, we empower children to embrace an active lifestyle that benefits both their bodies and minds, laying a solid foundation for a prosperous and fulfilling future."
188;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In my opinion, it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students. Although, many argue that it provide good working experience, but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways. Having jobs would affect the health of the student. It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life.A student has to do lots of studies in today's competitive world to prove himself. He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades. If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time, then it would cause an extra burden on them. Furthermore, jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on. This would result in stress, tension and tiredness. They won't be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep. Thus, would affect their mental and physical health.Another reason, jobs can divert students from their studies. If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money. They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money. This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies. Moreover, they drop out their studies so as to earn more money.In addition to this, the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time. He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends, clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others. They have whole life to do job and prove themselves, but the childhood phase will never return in their life. Therefore, they should take advantage of life as much possible they can.Thus, for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies. Having job would affect their health, divert them from studies and take away one of the important phase from their life.;In my opinion, it is not a good idea for teenagers to take on jobs while they are still students. The demands of a job can significantly interfere with their lives in various detrimental ways. Firstly, the health of the student is often compromised when they balance work and school. The pressures of maintaining a job can lead to stress, sleep deprivation, and even burnout. Teenagers are still in a crucial developmental phase, and the physical and mental repercussions of overworking can have long-lasting effects.Furthermore, working part-time can divert a teenager's focus and attention away from their studies. The time and energy expended at a job could be better allocated to academic pursuits and building essential skills. Engaging in extracurricular activities or study groups can enhance a student's educational experience, allowing them to explore their interests and develop their talents. In contrast, the responsibility of a job might lead to decreased academic performance, as fatigue and lack of time may hinder their ability to complete assignments or participate in classroom discussions. Additionally, taking on a job can encroach on what should be a vital period of life—childhood. Teenagers should be allowed to savor their youth, build friendships, and experience the joys of adolescence without the pressures of adult responsibilities. A job at a young age can skew their priorities, pushing them toward adult concerns prematurely and depriving them of the carefree moments that contribute to their personal growth.In conclusion, while the experience of working may offer certain benefits, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks. The interference with health, academic performance, and the essential joys of childhood make it a decision that should be approached with caution. Teenagers should focus on their education and personal development to lay a strong foundation for their futures, rather than succumbing to the pressures of balancing work and school.
189;Some people believe that zoos serve useful function. Other people believe that it's cruel & wrong to confine animals in zoos. Tell which point of view you are agree with.;It has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos. Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment. Over the time, there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals.Some people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos. First of all, zoos are fascinating places of entertainment. For this point, they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure. Another function that all zoos serve relates to education. Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world. Moreover, some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct.On the other hand, there are, however, people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals. Being confined, animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented. In their opinion, zoos are some kind of prisons and it's so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons.From my point of view, I agree with the first group. In modern life, zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers. Besides, recently, zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature, taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity.;Zoos have played a significant role in human culture across the globe for centuries, evolving from mere menageries to complex institutions dedicated to education and conservation. Many people view zoos as vital sources of entertainment and learning, offering the chance to observe wildlife up close and fostering a sense of wonder about the natural world. Educational programs and interactive exhibits in modern zoos provide invaluable opportunities for visitors, particularly children, to learn about animal behavior, biodiversity, and conservation efforts. This connection to wildlife can inspire a sense of responsibility towards the environment, potentially influencing future generations to advocate for and engage in conservation initiatives.On the contrary, there remains a growing body of critique against the existence of zoos. Opponents argue that it is morally indefensible to confine animals, who would otherwise roam vast habitats in the wild, into enclosures that can often be restrictive and unnatural. This perspective emphasizes the psychological and physical harm that captivity can cause, leading to stress and abnormal behaviors in animals. Advocates for animal rights argue that a life spent in a cage, regardless of the quality of care, is not a life worth living for many species.As society's understanding of animal welfare evolves, the debate over zoos becomes increasingly complex. While many zoos have made substantial improvements to ensure the well-being of their inhabitants, the ethical implications of keeping animals in captivity continue to spark intense discussions. The balance between the educational and conservation benefits that zoos provide versus the ethical considerations surrounding animal welfare is a delicate one, making it crucial for zoos to innovate and adapt in ways that align with both education and humane treatment of animals. Ultimately, the future of zoos may depend on their ability to prioritize the welfare of animals while serving as centers for learning and conservation.
190;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;When I found the chance of studying in a group with my classmates, I wished I can go back in time and took all my exams again. I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features, getting help from other students, improving my attitude for learning, managing my time in an effective way.When pupils make a group for studying, all member of group have the same chance to help each other. They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course. For example, when a group faces with complex math problem, they can share their opinions to solve it. In addition, such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group. Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying. In a group of student, the best of those always encourages others to study harder. Besides, pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group. Clearly, better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements. When the students study with their friends, they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner. Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time, inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time. Therefore, time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying. In conclusion, I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of some important opportunities gaining with this activity. I can receive some helps from other student as well as improving my learning skills, also managing of time is another achievements of group-studying. Now, it is time to start without any regret from my previous exams.;Studying in a group of friends is a practice I strongly prefer, as it presents numerous opportunities for academic growth and personal development. The collaborative nature of group study allows for a rich exchange of ideas, enabling each member to benefit from the diverse perspectives and knowledge of others. This not only aids comprehension but also makes the learning process more dynamic and engaging.One of the most significant advantages of studying in a group is the support it provides. When struggling with a particularly challenging concept, I can turn to my friends for help. Their explanations often illuminate areas I found confusing, allowing me to grasp material that might have remained elusive if I were studying alone. This collaborative approach fosters a sense of camaraderie and shared responsibility, as we all strive to ensure that no one is left behind. Moreover, teaching or explaining topics to peers can reinforce my own understanding, solidifying the knowledge in my memory.In addition to receiving help, group study enhances my learning skills. Engaging with friends encourages active participation and critical thinking, as we frequently debate viewpoints and tackle problems together. This interactive atmosphere accelerates my ability to analyze information critically and communicate more effectively. Furthermore, collaborating with others helps me develop essential soft skills, including teamwork, leadership, and time management, which are invaluable in both academic and professional settings.Ultimately, the benefits of studying in a group of friends are multifaceted. From gaining support in difficult subjects to improving my learning skills, this collaborative approach enriches my educational experience. By fostering an environment of shared knowledge and mutual encouragement, group study not only makes learning more enjoyable but also equips me with the tools necessary for future success.
191;Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Other choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Compare the advantages of each choice. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons to support your answers.;Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man's life, people might have different preferences: some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends, while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends. In my view, I prefer the second attitude.The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others' experiences. For instance, among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport, or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before. Of course, while differences give the opportunity to learn, they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement. This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends. In fact, in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same.Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded. For example, if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice, your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages.When you have just few close friends, on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more, but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours, adding less to your experience.In sum, although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points, I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life.;Friendship is undeniably one of the foundational values in a person's life. It enriches our experiences, shapes our identities, and provides a support system during life's challenges. However, the nature of friendships can vary significantly among individuals. While some prefer a small circle of close friends, others thrive in the company of a larger group. Personally, I align with the latter attitude, as the benefits of maintaining contact with a diverse array of friends far outweigh the limitations of a smaller, more intimate circle.Having a large network of friends opens up a multitude of perspectives and experiences. Each friend brings a unique background, set of values, and opinions, contributing to a rich tapestry of interactions. This diversity can enhance personal growth, as it exposes me to differing viewpoints and ideas. When discussing life events, challenges, or aspirations, hearing multiple perspectives can provide deeper insights and foster critical thinking. For example, when navigating a difficult decision, I can draw on the collective wisdom of my friends, who may have faced similar situations, and learn from their experiences.Moreover, maintaining a larger friend group encourages adaptability and social skills. Engaging with various personalities aids in developing communication abilities and conflict resolution skills. This can be beneficial not only in personal relationships but also in professional settings, where teamwork and collaboration are often paramount.In conclusion, while some may favor a select few close friendships for their depth, I believe that the breadth provided by a larger circle of friends is equally valuable. Through these relationships, I am granted the opportunity to learn, grow, and connect with a wide array of experiences, ultimately enriching my life in profound ways.
192;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways or should government spend more money on improving public transportation (Buses, trains,subways)?;The development of public transportation is the most essential thing for a developed society. Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources, the air pollution, the loss of a sense of community. So, I think the government have to spend more money on improving it.The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out. Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move. If people use too many private cars, the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly. Instead of using many private cars, people can use public transportation, such as bus, train, subway, each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person.The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution. Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide, heat and so on. They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer. The more cars are driven, the more pollution will be put into air. If we use the public transportation, less cars will be used and less pollution will be emitted. The atmosphere, surrounding us, will be protected and help us more healthy.The use of public transportation make us live more sociable. When we drive a private car, we are alone or only our family members that we already know and lost the opportunity to make friends with others or to see that we are a part of this society. When using public transportation, we have a chance to meet more people and more chances to discovery new aspects of life.Using public transportation has a lot of advantages for the modern society facing a lot of problems: the environmental population, the isolation in life, the depletion of natural resources. So, the government have to invest more for it and encourage people to use.;The use of public transportation stands as one of the most effective strategies for conserving natural resources, particularly as many of these resources continue to deplete. In a world where environmental urgency is paramount, shifting from reliance on private vehicles to public transportation systems—such as buses, trains, and subways—offers a sustainable solution. These systems are designed to accommodate larger numbers of people, significantly reducing the amount of oil and gasoline consumed per individual. When individuals choose private car travel, they inadvertently contribute to a vicious cycle of resource depletion. Each vehicle on the road not only consumes fossil fuels but also emits pollutants into the atmosphere. The cumulative effect of millions of cars contributes to air pollution and accelerates climate change, resulting in a warmer Earth. In contrast, public transportation serves as a greener alternative, as it can move many passengers simultaneously, thus lowering overall emissions and conserving fuel.Moreover, utilizing public transit encourages a more sociable lifestyle. Instead of isolation in individual vehicles, passengers share spaces, fostering interactions and community bonds. Whether it’s sharing stories with fellow commuters or engaging in conversations, public transportation creates opportunities for social connections that are often lost when individuals travel alone in their cars. In conclusion, the environmental and social benefits of public transportation cannot be overstated. By choosing buses, trains, or subways over private cars, we not only conserve dwindling natural resources but also work towards a cleaner, less polluted planet. Embracing public transportation is a vital step toward maintaining the health of our environment and enhancing social cohesion among communities. Thus, it emerges as a clear and practical choice for a sustainable future.
193;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals. Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention. In my opinion, we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment.Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals. Firstly, like we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts. Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas. When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts. Hence, when they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate. In addition to the previous point, various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care. For instance, I recall my first trip to a zoo, at age eight. I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated. I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo. They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals.In conclusion, I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible. Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals. Moreover, many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them.;The debate surrounding zoos often centers on their role in animal conservation versus the ethical implications of keeping animals in captivity. Proponents argue that zoos serve as safe havens for endangered species, providing them with protection, breeding programs, and education regarding their natural habitats. Through these efforts, zoos claim to contribute to the preservation of animal populations that face threats from habitat destruction and poaching. Additionally, zoos can foster a connection between humans and wildlife, inspiring visitors to care about conservation issues.However, critics argue that zoos inherently treat animals as inferior, as they confine them to artificial environments that fail to meet their complex needs. Many believe that animals ought to live freely in their natural habitats, where they can exercise their instincts and engage in natural behaviors. The stress of captivity can result in physical and psychological issues for the animals, leading to detrimental effects on their well-being.In my opinion, it is essential to prioritize animal welfare and advocate for the preservation of habitats instead of relying solely on zoos as a solution. Animals thrive in their ecosystems, and while zoos might provide temporary refuge for some species, they do not counter the fundamental problems caused by habitat destruction. Innovative approaches, such as wildlife sanctuaries and rehabilitation centers, can better support animals in need while promoting their return to the wild.Ultimately, we must strive to help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environments. This means not only boosting conservation efforts but also addressing broader environmental issues that impact wildlife. By safeguarding natural habitats and advocating for sustainable practices, we can ensure that animals are treated as deserving of our respect and attention in their own rightful places.
194;A university plans to develop a new research center in your country. Some people want a center for business research. Other people want a center for research in agriculture (farming). Which of these two kinds of research centers do you recommend for your country? Use specific reasons in your recommendation.;Most of the universities in the world seek to develop some research in some countries. These researches can be aimed for several fields such as business or agriculture. If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research, I would opt for the second one.First of all, my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture. Most of these lands are left without any treatment. The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land. This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land. Especially, if they have no knowledge or education in this field.Secondly, the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve. The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part. The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products. For example, the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country. The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product, how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms.Another reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs. Obviously, showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money. Some people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field. For me being a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business, but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction, and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that.My country need to focus more on the agriculture by establishing centers for research in this field, which will have some very positive consequences on agriculture people work, on the economy and on the employment.;When considering the establishment of a new research center in my country, I would advocate for the development of a center for agriculture research over a center for business research. The decision lies in agriculture's profound impact on the well-being of my country’s citizens and its potential to stimulate economic growth.Firstly, a center for agriculture research can significantly enhance our citizens' ability to optimize land use and improve farming practices. Many local farmers lack access to modern agricultural techniques, resources, and knowledge that can substantially increase crop yields. By establishing a research center focused on agriculture, we can provide valuable insights into sustainable farming practices, pest management, and soil health. These improvements would not only ensure higher productivity but also empower farmers to make informed decisions, consequently improving food security for our communities.Secondly, agriculture has the potential to play a vital role in revitalizing our economy. Currently, the agriculture sector represents only thirty percent of the market part in our country. This statistic illustrates the vast opportunity for growth and development that exists within this field. Investing in agriculture research can lead to innovations that improve efficiency, reduce waste, and create new markets. By fostering advancements in areas such as crop diversification, organic farming, and agro-technology, we can stimulate job creation and increase our export capacity, ultimately leading to a more robust economy.In conclusion, while both centers hold value, the establishment of an agriculture research center resonates more with the immediate needs and challenges faced by my fellow citizens. Through increased agricultural efficiency and significant economic impact, such a center could lay the groundwork for a sustainable and prosperous future for our nation.
195;People learn in different ways. Some people learn by doing things, other people learn by reading about things, others learn by listening to people talk about things. Which of these methods of learning is best for you? Use specific examples to support your choice.;People have a lot of things to learn in their lives. They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills. One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about. There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives.First of all, learning by doing things develops our maturity. When you do things by your self, you learn to depend on yourself. You will not be in need to refer to books or persons. The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity. For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader, they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group, or even a situation. We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading. Secondly, learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about. There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them. Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing. People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming. Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming.Another reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things. With the time, Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring. Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things. So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them.The history shows that learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things. People should not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn. They should try and keep trying until they learn what they want to learn.;Life is a continuous journey of learning, with countless opportunities to expand our knowledge and skills. People employ various methods to enhance their understanding, including reading, listening, and engaging in practical experiences. Among these, I have a strong preference for learning by doing, as it offers unique benefits that transcend traditional forms of education.Learning by doing allows individuals to immerse themselves in activities, fostering a deeper understanding of concepts. This hands-on approach is particularly effective because it involves active participation rather than passive reception of information. As we engage in tasks directly, we encounter challenges and make decisions that require critical thinking. This process enhances our problem-solving abilities and encourages creativity, as we often need to devise innovative solutions on the fly.Moreover, undertaking tasks independently cultivates a sense of self-reliance and maturity. When we take the initiative to learn a new skill or complete a project, we learn to trust ourselves. This growing dependence on our abilities instills confidence and reinforces the idea that we are capable of overcoming obstacles. The sense of accomplishment that comes from successfully navigating challenges deepens our resilience and prepares us for future endeavors.Additionally, learning by doing often leads to a more enjoyable experience. Engaging actively with the material makes the learning process feel less like a chore and more like an adventure. It allows us to explore our interests and discover our passions, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling life.In summary, while there are numerous ways to acquire knowledge, I firmly believe that learning by doing is the most impactful. It not only develops essential skills but also promotes independence and fosters a sense of maturity. Through practical experiences, we grow into well-rounded individuals, equipped to tackle the complexities of life with confidence.
196;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;The advent of cheap airfares has revolutionized travel, making it accessible to a broader audience, particularly among the lower-income groups. In the past, air travel was often seen as a luxury reserved for the affluent, but with the rise of budget airlines, countless individuals are now able to explore new cities and countries. This democratization of travel has not only enriched personal experiences but has also stimulated local economies through tourism. Families who once found travel financially prohibitive can now easily visit relatives or embark on vacations, expanding their horizons and fostering cultural exchange.However, the expansion of affordable flights is not without its drawbacks, particularly concerning environmental sustainability. The aviation industry is a significant contributor to carbon emissions, with burning fossil fuels releasing vast quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This phenomenon exacerbates climate change, leading to an increase in global temperatures and severe weather patterns. As demand for low-cost flights continues to rise, the environmental impact becomes increasingly concerning. The direct correlation between cheap air travel and ecological degradation highlights a critical dilemma: how to balance the social benefits of increased mobility with the urgent need for environmental preservation. While budget airlines have made travel possible for many, the environmental consequences cannot be ignored. The challenge lies in seeking alternatives that accommodate both the desire for exploration and the imperative to protect our planet. Sustainable aviation fuels, stricter emissions regulations, and innovative technologies may offer pathways to mitigate the environmental toll of air travel.In conclusion, while cheap airfares have opened the doors to travel for lower-income individuals, they also pose significant challenges to environmental integrity. As society moves forward, it is crucial to address these issues to ensure that the joys of travel do not come at the expense of our planet’s health.
197;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation(buses, trains, subways)? Why?Ê;Many people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation. In my opinion, governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating.First, the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation. Cars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up. In the contrary, if the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower. And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline.Second, public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems. Averagely, public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars. It means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes.Last but not least, using public transportation is much safer than private transportation. According to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care. Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting.In short, I can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in.;"Governments should indeed prioritize investment in public transportation systems as a viable solution to the myriad problems caused by the increasing prevalence of private cars. The surge in the number of private vehicles on the roads has been a major contributor to several pressing issues, including resource depletion, air pollution, and road safety concerns. By enhancing public transportation, governments can significantly alleviate these challenges.Firstly, utilizing public transportation effectively reduces the amount of resources consumed in the transportation sector. Private cars require substantial amounts of fuel and maintenance resources, while buses and trains can transport many passengers simultaneously. This collective approach means fewer vehicles on the road, leading to decreased fuel consumption and a more efficient use of energy. Consequently, governments can redirect resources saved from reduced fuel consumption into other essential services, benefitting society at large.Secondly, public transportation plays a crucial role in mitigating air pollution. The environmental impact of private vehicles is severe, as they contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions and other airborne pollutants. By encouraging the use of public transportation, we can promote cleaner alternatives and reduce the overall carbon footprint of the transportation sector. A transition to a more robust public transit system could mean a marked decrease in emissions, leading to improved air quality for urban populations.Moreover, safety is a critical advantage of public transportation. According to the National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than traveling by private car. This statistic underscores the reduced risk of accidents when more individuals opt for public transport. By investing in reliable and safe transit options, governments can enhance road safety and protect their citizens.In conclusion, investing in public transportation is not merely an option; it is a necessity for governments aiming to address the challenges posed by the rising number of private cars. By reducing resource consumption, combating air pollution, and improving safety, public transportation can lead to a healthier, more sustainable future."
198;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer?;Everyone has their method to success in life. At school or university, success depends on how we study. Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups. Yet, I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more, and it helps me to build my personality.Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons. For instance, I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone. I can prepare my schedules, guidelines, exercises and go over them all. Moreover, we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math, reading, and drawing. In my opinion, I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone.Additionally, we are building our personalities when we study alone. For example, answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent. Also, it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future. Personally, when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time, it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful. To conclude, there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group. In fact, I agree with the idea of studying a lone since it helps me to focus more and establish my personality. Success needs us to work hard and sacrifice more whether we choose to study alone or with group.;"The effectiveness of study methods can vary significantly from student to student. While some individuals thrive in group study settings, relying on the collaborative exchange of ideas and shared resources, I personally find that studying individually suits me best. The benefits of solitary study extend beyond mere concentration; they also foster personal growth and independence.Studying alone provides an environment free from distractions that often accompany group settings. In a group, conversations can veer off-topic, and the influence of peers can sometimes lead to a fragmented focus. When I study individually, I can immerse myself in the material at my own pace, allowing for deeper understanding and retention. This singular focus enables me to grasp complex concepts without interruption, ultimately leading to better academic performance.Moreover, solitary study promotes the development of essential life skills, particularly responsibility and independence. When faced with homework challenges, working through them without external assistance requires a proactive attitude. For instance, when I tackle difficult problems by myself, I learn to seek solutions through research and critical thinking rather than relying on others to provide answers. This process fosters a sense of achievement and confidence, reinforcing my ability to handle future challenges independently.Additionally, studying alone allows for self-reflection, enabling me to identify personal strengths and areas that require improvement. This introspective element is crucial for character development, as it encourages us to take ownership of our learning journey. By holding myself accountable for my studies, I am cultivating a disciplined approach that will serve me well throughout my academic and professional life.In conclusion, while group study sessions can be beneficial for some, I firmly believe that studying individually not only enhances concentration but also contributes significantly to personal responsibility and independence. This method strengthens my character and equips me with the skills needed for future success."
199;Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed (damaged) by human activity. Others feel that human activity makes the Earth a better place to live. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Whether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue. Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth. However, I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet, for human are polluting the Earth's environment, exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species.People are corrupting their ecosphere. In recent decades, concurrently with the increase of human consume, the waste discarded by human also multiplies. These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a ""new"" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage. Furthermore, the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air, causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain, global warming or climate change.Besides, people are draining the Earth's natural resources. These resources such as oil, coal are vital for human activity, therefore nowadays, the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people. Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after, the Earth's natural resources are totally exhausted. At that time, human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources.Also, people are endangering other species' live. Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food. Through million years of hunting, especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite, people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct. Moreover, people, suffering from the population pressure, are expanding their living area; consequently, the living area of other species narrowed. This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction.All in all, from discussed reasons, we can conclude that human activity are gradually destroy the Earth since it is polluting the Earth environment, depleting the resource and imperiling other species' lives.";The degradation of the Earth’s environment has become a pressing concern as human activities continue to threaten the delicate balance of nature. At the heart of this issue lies the relentless consumption of natural resources such as oil and coal, which are being depleted at alarming rates. These fossil fuels, while critical to global energy needs and economic development, are finite resources that are being exploited without consideration for future generations. The extraction and combustion of these resources not only contribute to the depletion of our planet's reserves but also release greenhouse gases, exacerbating climate change and creating an environment inhospitable for many species.Moreover, the pollution stemming from industrial processes, transportation, and waste disposal is directly jeopardizing the existence of countless other species. Habitats are being destroyed through deforestation and urban expansion, forcing many animals to lose their homes, food sources, and ultimately, their lives. For instance, the destruction of rainforests for logging and agriculture not only threatens biodiversity but also disrupts ecosystems that are vital for human survival, such as those that regulate climate and air quality.As pollution continues to rise, aquatic ecosystems are experiencing increased levels of toxins that harm marine life. The use of plastics and chemicals has turned oceans into dumping grounds, jeopardizing the health of numerous aquatic species. The alarming rates of extinction and the loss of biodiversity serve as evident indicators of the environmental crisis that humanity faces.In conclusion, the relentless pursuit of resources has led to pollution and the depletion of natural reserves, endangering not only human life but the existence of countless other species on Earth. It is imperative that we acknowledge our role and take action towards sustainable practices to safeguard our planet for future generations. Failure to do so may result in irrevocable damage to the environment, leading to a bleak future where both humans and wildlife are unable to thrive.
200;A company is going to give some money either to support the arts or protect the environment. Which do you think the company chooses? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"If I had the opportunity to help a company make a decision on spending money either on supporting the arts or helping the environment, I would choose the latter without hesitation for the reasons below. First, conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history. According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association, we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed, which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered. What's more, rising sea levels, caused by global warming, have reached a level that is threatening human's life in many countries. If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars, nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change, causing flooding, drought, and an increasing amount of damaging storms. In short, the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn't take harsh measures now, we never will.Furthermore, supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually. Nowadays, an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation; therefore, sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising. Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment, then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society.Finally, conservation leads us to a higher standard of living. I confess that art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings, but, with exhaust fumes and acid rain, we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs. Biodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art.To sum up, although supporting art will benefit the human beings and the company in short-term interest, I still hold the environment protection for long-term interest.";"The current state of our global ecosystem is dire, representing the most critical condition it has ever encountered. From rapidly increasing temperatures to unprecedented loss of biodiversity, the signs are unmistakable: immediate and harsh measures must be taken to avert an irreversible disaster. If we fail to act decisively now, the repercussions we face in the near future will be catastrophic, not only affecting wildlife but also undermining human well-being.One area often overlooked is the intersection of environmental protection and advertising. Supporting environment-friendly initiatives can serve as a powerful method of promotion. Consumers today are more conscious of their environmental footprint and are increasingly gravitating toward brands that reflect their values. By investing in sustainable practices and ecological mindfulness, companies can distinguish themselves in a crowded marketplace. This not only attracts conscientious consumers but also fosters loyalty, as individuals are more likely to support brands that contribute positively to the planet.Moreover, conservation efforts lead to a higher standard of living for everyone. Healthy ecosystems provide essential services—clean air, safe drinking water, pollination of crops, and natural resources—all vital to human survival. Investing in the preservation of these ecosystems supports not just environmental health but also our economic security. Sustainable practices enhance workforce productivity, reduce healthcare costs associated with pollution, and promote tourism in natural areas, ultimately boosting local economies.In conclusion, supporting environmental protection is not just an ethical responsibility; it presents a robust opportunity for innovative marketing while simultaneously propelling socio-economic advancement. If we choose to adopt an environmentally-focused approach now, we can create a sustainable future, fostering both ecological resilience and enhanced quality of life. The urgency of this mission cannot be overstated—our actions shape the world we leave for future generations."
201;We all work or will work in our jobs with many different kinds of people. In your opinion, what are some important characteristics of a co-worker (Someone you work closely with) ? Use reasons and specific examples to explain why these characteristics are important.Ê;At work, you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment. However, the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you, and in most instances you have to rely on him or her. Therefore in my view, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.The co-workers should be cooperative with one another. If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes. I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious. Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not. Most of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person. However, one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor. When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse. From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility. Therefore, I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment.The co-workers need to trust each other. They should not act on suspicion. This is a very important aspect in the work environment. I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me. To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him. However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me. But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department. Finally, the co-workers should believe in fellowship. This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships. After all, you spend most of your day at office. If you have a good company in office, it is certainly a blessing.;"In any workplace, the dynamics between co-workers significantly shape the overall environment and productivity. To foster a positive and effective working atmosphere, three critical characteristics stand out: cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship. These traits not only enhance interpersonal relationships but also drive collective success.Firstly, cooperation is fundamental in any collaborative effort. Effective teamwork relies on individuals who are willing to share responsibilities, communicate openly, and contribute to group goals. When a co-worker is uncooperative, it often leads to misunderstandings and disputes. For instance, if team members do not align on project objectives or fail to support one another, the potential for conflict rises. When cooperation is absent, the flow of work can become obstructed, resulting in missed deadlines and a decline in morale. Therefore, fostering a cooperative spirit among colleagues is vital for a harmonious workplace.Secondly, trustworthiness is another essential characteristic that cultivates a healthy work environment. A trustworthy co-worker is someone who can be relied upon to meet commitments and maintain confidentiality. When trust exists within a team, members feel secure in sharing ideas and feedback without the fear of betrayal or misrepresentation. This openness promotes innovation and encourages individuals to take initiative, knowing that their contributions will be valued and respected.Lastly, the trait of fellowship is crucial for building strong relationships among colleagues. Fellowship goes beyond mere acquaintance; it encompasses a sense of camaraderie and mutual support. Co-workers who engage in fellowship actively foster an inclusive atmosphere, where everyone feels valued and motivated. This strong relational foundation can greatly reduce workplace stress and improve job satisfaction.In conclusion, the characteristics of cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship are fundamental to the success of any team. Ensuring that these traits are present among co-workers not only minimizes disputes but also builds a resilient and thriving workplace culture."
203;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;During these digital age, the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society. Almost every school develops their online class systems. One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning. Although, online classes have many advantages, for me, I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons.First, the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying. Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class. Consequently, the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate's ideas. Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends.Second, classroom learning provides other activities than studying. During student's free time, they have a number of activities that they can join, such as playing sports, going to lab, or going to library. These activities lead to more interact with their friends. Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities, furthermore, they have a chance to learn about their societies. While the online course keeps the children at their home only.Lastly, in school, there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice. The professor provides good answers to you. They do not mind helping you, and they never leave you alone when you got a problem. In contrast, in distance learning, these aspects of the professor had reduced their important. The professor has been assigned to teach only. Moreover, there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question.In conclusion, traditional learning still has many benefits to the students. But in the future, it seems that the distance learning become more popular and ordinary in schools.;"In the digital age we live in today, the advent of online classes has revolutionized the educational landscape, making learning more accessible and flexible than ever before. With technology becoming an integral part of our lives, particularly after the recent global pandemic, many institutions have turned to online platforms to deliver education. This transformation raises an essential question: Should online computer classes replace traditional classroom learning?Proponents of online learning argue that it offers numerous advantages. Firstly, accessibility is a significant benefit; students can learn from anywhere in the world, breaking the geographical barriers that often limit educational opportunities. Furthermore, online classes are generally more flexible, allowing students to learn at their own pace, revisit lectures, and manage their study schedules around personal commitments. This adaptability can enhance the learning experience, particularly for those who may struggle with the rigidity of traditional classroom settings.On the other hand, classroom learning provides unique advantages that virtual environments cannot easily replicate. The social interaction in a physical classroom fosters collaboration, motivation, and a sense of community among students and teachers. Face-to-face communication aids in developing interpersonal skills and allows for immediate feedback and support. Additionally, some students benefit profoundly from structured environments that traditional classrooms provide, as well as from hands-on activities that can be harder to replicate online.Ultimately, the best educational approach may not be to completely replace traditional classroom learning with online classes but to blend both methods through a hybrid model. This approach encapsulates the flexibility and accessibility of online learning while preserving the vital social interactions and hands-on experiences offered by physical classrooms. By harmonizing both modalities, we can create a more comprehensive and effective educational framework that caters to the diverse needs of students in today’s rapidly evolving world."
204;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;The issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes. This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide. Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic. An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students. However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.Firstly, a liberal policy is very feasible. Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy. Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend. So an optional attendance saves time and money.Secondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook. This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic. By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching. Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.In addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life. Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning. With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency. Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.Finally, psychology knows two types of motivation. There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset. And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people. Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being. However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims. By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves. These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.To conclude, it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students. I hold this belief due to the improvement of students' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards.;The traditional educational model typically mandates student attendance, often leading to a routine that focuses more on compliance than genuine learning. However, allowing students the freedom to decide whether to attend classes can significantly enhance their overall quality of life and academic performance. This flexibility proves beneficial not only by improving student motivation but also by teaching essential life skills.Firstly, autonomy in attendance fosters a sense of responsibility and accountability among students. When individuals have the liberty to choose whether to attend a class, they must assess their priorities, manage their time effectively, and make decisions that positively impact their academic journeys. This self-directed approach nurtures critical life skills, such as time management, self-discipline, and prioritization, which are vital in both professional and personal contexts.Furthermore, flexibility in class attendance can lead to a more motivated and engaged student body. When students have the option to stay away from classes, they are more likely to attend when they feel genuinely ready and inspired. This selective attendance can promote deeper engagement with the course material, resulting in more profound learning experiences. Students can allocate their time to studying, working on projects, or exploring interests that ignite their passion for learning.Additionally, the improvement of student life quality is an essential consideration. The pressures of mandatory attendance can leave students feeling stifled and burned out. Allowing students the choice to opt out of class when necessary can lead to better mental health outcomes, more time for extracurricular activities, and a greater overall sense of balance in their lives.In conclusion, granting students the freedom to decide their class attendance can improve motivation, foster critical life skills, and enhance their overall quality of life. By fostering a culture of flexibility, educational institutions can help cultivate empowered, self-motivated learners prepared for the challenges of the future.
205;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Place of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors. Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas, whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town. I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages, such as good weather, a healthy life and better facilities.Firstly, the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items. One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town. Also, in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic. Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness. Moreover, in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits. Regardless of some exceptions, it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities.Secondly, another advantage of small towns is living costs. Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then, in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities. Therefore, in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes, also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services. Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money.In conclusion, I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress, because of better weather conditions and also, better relationship within a town. In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities therefore on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities. However it is an obvious fact that people in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress.;Living in a small town has always appealed to me for various reasons, particularly when considering aspects like good weather, a healthier lifestyle, and enhanced community facilities. Small towns often enjoy milder climates, with less pollution and green spaces that contribute to one’s overall well-being. The slower pace of life found in these towns encourages outdoor activities and fosters a connection to nature, both of which are crucial for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. In addition to a favorable climate, small towns typically have lower living costs, which is a significant concern for individuals and families. Housing, groceries, and general expenses are often more affordable in smaller communities, allowing residents to have a higher quality of life without the financial strain often experienced in larger urban areas. The cost-effective nature of small towns enables families and individuals to allocate their resources more effectively, which can lead to better living standards and stress reduction.Moreover, the tight-knit communities found in small towns create a sense of belonging that is often missing in bustling cities. In smaller locales, neighbors know each other and share common experiences, fostering a supportive environment where residents are more likely to engage in social activities. This contrasts sharply with the anonymity that can pervade larger cities, where people may feel isolated despite the crowds they navigate daily. Ultimately, the advantages of living in a small town—such as better weather, affordability, and close-knit communities—underscore why I prefer such an environment. In a world where loneliness and stress are prevalent, the simplicity and interconnectedness found in small towns provide a peaceful refuge that enhances quality of life.
206;In many countries, young people leave rural areas to study or work in cities. What do you think are reason of this? Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;These days, there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities. Personally, I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this.To begin with, the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas. Obviously, many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career. Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living. For example, if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time. However, this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences. There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities. As a result, cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation. Additionally, it might put strain on the environment. If there are more people in the cities, there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road, which causes air pollution.In conclusion, young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials. In my opinion, however, I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment.;In recent years, there has been a significant trend of young people migrating from rural areas to urban centers, largely in pursuit of job opportunities and enhanced educational prospects. While this transition may appear favorable at first glance, I argue that it has detrimental effects on both the quality of life for individuals and the environment as a whole.One of the primary concerns regarding this migration is the decline in quality of life experienced by many young urban dwellers. Cities often struggle to accommodate an influx of residents, leading to overcrowding, high living costs, and increased competition for jobs. Young individuals may find themselves living in inadequate housing conditions, far from their places of employment or study, and faced with long commutes that exacerbate stress and diminish their overall well-being. Furthermore, the urban lifestyle can bring about feelings of isolation and disconnection, especially for those who grew up in close-knit rural communities.Additionally, the environmental impact of urban migration cannot be ignored. As cities expand to accommodate growing populations, green spaces are often sacrificed for the sake of infrastructure development and housing projects. This not only contributes to air pollution and a loss of biodiversity but also exacerbates climate change impacts. The increased demand for transportation, resources, and energy in urban areas amplifies ecological footprints and leads to unsustainable consumption patterns, threatening the planet's future.In conclusion, while the pursuit of job opportunities and education is essential for personal and professional growth, the trend of young people migrating from the countryside to cities comes at a cost. The detrimental effects on quality of life and environmental sustainability highlight the need for a more balanced approach to development—one that preserves rural life while providing equitable opportunities in both urban and rural contexts. It is imperative to address these concerns to foster healthier living environments and a more sustainable future for all.
207;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement. High school students should take a course on basic economics;In today's community, economy becomes the order of the day. Getting to know the theory in this area seems really important for our students. Then, the earlier we jump into this area, the more skillful we will be. Thus, in my point of view, although it will take some time on it, high school students should take a course on basic economics. Let me explain it in detail.For the primary concern, it can provide students a sense of direction in academy. Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field, let them to know what this subject mainly discuss. That will help the students cultivate their own interest and a sense of career orientation. Finally, students may study harder for their economic dreams. On the other hand, economy is always correlate with politics, students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status, which may open their vision toward the nation and don't get limited in the textbooks. Besides, there is also an intimate connection between economy and enterprises, students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid.In addition, the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college. They may feel more readily to learn the knowledge in this field and save much time, with that they are able to study more efficiently and more deeply than other students. That as well would provide the students with more confidence and let them become more compatible.Considering all those factors above, I suggest the basic course of economic is necessary.;"In today's fast-paced and ever-evolving community, the economy has emerged as a pivotal force shaping our lives and aspirations. Economics is no longer confined to the realms of academia or government policy; it has infiltrated every facet of our daily existence. With the increasing complexity and interconnectivity of global markets, understanding economic principles has become essential. The earlier individuals delve into this field, the more adept they will become in navigating and responding to economic changes.Jumping into the study of economics at an early age equips students with a valuable skill set that will serve them in various aspects of life. The knowledge gained will enable them to make informed decisions, whether they are considering investments, understanding consumer behavior, or analyzing market trends. It cultivates critical thinking and analytical skills, allowing individuals to dissect economic issues and their impact on society. In a world where financial literacy is paramount, being well-versed in economic concepts sets a foundation for future success.Moreover, a basic economics course is immensely beneficial for students transitioning to college. Many college programs, regardless of the major, will touch on economic principles in some capacity. Familiarity with concepts such as supply and demand, market equilibrium, and opportunity cost can demystify more advanced topics encountered in higher education. For students pursuing fields like business, social sciences, or even healthcare, a grounding in economics can foster a deeper understanding of industry dynamics and facilitate better decision-making.In conclusion, as the economy increasingly dominates our community landscape, it is imperative that students engage with economic education early on. Not only does this knowledge enhance their skill set, but it also prepares them for academic success and informed citizenship in an interconnected world."
208;University education should be restricted to the very best academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;"In today's competitive world, outstanding academic students often find themselves at the forefront of university admissions, primarily due to their intellectual advantages. Academic excellence typically demonstrates a student’s ability to engage with complex ideas, conduct research, and critically analyze information. These skills are undoubtedly valuable in a university setting where rigorous academic demands shape the student experience. However, university education extends beyond mere intellectual achievement; it is also a vital incubator for nurturing artistic talent and developing essential soft skills.Universities provide a unique environment where creativity can flourish. Through various programs in the arts, students are encouraged to explore their creative potential, participate in performances, exhibitions, and workshops. This artistic engagement fosters innovation and personalized expression, which are equally crucial in today’s multifaceted workforce. Furthermore, soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving are cultivated through collaborations and interdisciplinary projects. These skills empower students to adapt and thrive in diverse environments, ensuring they are not just equipped with knowledge but also the interpersonal abilities necessary for success.However, the restriction of university access primarily to high-achieving academic students raises important considerations. On one hand, prioritizing intellectual rigor may ensure a high standard of learning and contribute to producing future leaders in various fields. On the other hand, this exclusive focus risks neglecting talented individuals who may possess exceptional artistic gifts or critical soft skills without high academic grades. This limitation could mean that diverse voices and ideas are overlooked, reducing the richness and vibrancy of the university experience.In conclusion, while the eligibility criteria based on academic prowess have their merits, they also come with drawbacks. A more inclusive approach that recognizes and nurtures diverse talents could create a more holistic educational environment, fostering not only scholars but also well-rounded individuals ready to take on the complexities of the modern world."
209;Prevention is better than cure. Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state has evolved to encompass a comprehensive approach to healthcare that goes beyond mere treatment of illnesses. Governments are increasingly recognizing the imperative of providing sustainable healthcare systems that not only address immediate health needs but also prioritize health education and prevention. This shift is crucial for fostering a healthier population and reducing the long-term economic burden of healthcare expenditures.Sustainable healthcare entails the integration of preventative measures, public health initiatives, and community education into the broader health system. By focusing on prevention, governments can significantly reduce the incidence of chronic diseases that dominate modern health challenges, such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Health education plays a pivotal role in this regard, empowering individuals with the knowledge and resources they need to make healthier lifestyle choices. By instilling awareness about nutrition, exercise, and mental well-being, citizens become active participants in their health journey, leading to a more informed society that prioritizes well-being over reactive treatment.Moreover, allocating a greater proportion of budgetary resources to education and prevention initiatives can yield substantial savings in the long run. When individuals are educated about health risks and encouraged to engage in prevention strategies, the healthcare system sees a decrease in treatment costs, emergency interventions, and hospitalizations. This proactive approach not only enhances the quality of life for citizens but also alleviates financial strain on government healthcare budgets.In conclusion, the welfare state must evolve to prioritize sustainable healthcare by significantly increasing investments in health education and preventive strategies. By doing so, governments can foster healthier populations, reduce healthcare costs, and build a society that values proactive health measures. In an era of rising healthcare challenges, the call for heightened focus on prevention over treatment is not only necessary but also a moral imperative for any responsible welfare state.
210;With the pressures on todayÕs young people to succeed academically, some people believe that non-academic subjects at school (eg: physical education and cookery should be removed from the syllabus so that children can concentrate wholly on academic subjects. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Students have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success. While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that.To begin with, from the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects. If physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students’ health. For instance, after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes. Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people’s health, it will also decrease their learning capability.In addition, schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people. It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically. Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit. Thus, school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life.Some people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents. However, I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents. Moreover, parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills.In conclusion, I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student’s development. Therefore, schools should not remove these subjects.;"The importance of a well-rounded education that incorporates both academic and non-academic subjects cannot be overstated. While academic subjects like mathematics and literature are crucial for cognitive development, non-academic subjects, especially physical education, play an equally critical role in shaping students into well-balanced individuals.Physical education is essential for a student's holistic development. The removal of physical education from the curriculum could have dire consequences for students' health. With rising rates of childhood obesity and associated health issues, regular physical activity is vital in promoting healthy lifestyles. Participation in physical education not only helps students develop physical fitness and coordination but also teaches them essential life skills, such as teamwork, discipline, and resilience. These experiences foster a sense of achievement and a positive attitude towards health, which students carry into their adult lives.Moreover, schools have a responsibility to nurture well-rounded individuals. Success in life is not determined solely by academic knowledge; practical life skills are equally vital. Non-academic subjects encourage creativity, critical thinking, and interpersonal communication, which are essential in the modern workforce. For instance, activities such as art, music, and physical education can enhance students' confidence and creativity, allowing them to express themselves better and adapt to various situations in life.Incorporating non-academic subjects into the educational syllabus is crucial for preparing students for the complexities and challenges of the real world. While academic studies lay a foundation for intellectual growth, non-academic disciplines enrich students' experiences and contribute significantly to their personal and social development. Thus, a balanced curriculum that includes both academic and non-academic subjects is imperative for cultivating well-rounded individuals capable of thriving in all aspects of life."
211;When people move to another country, some of them decide to follow the customs of the new country. Others prefer to keep their own customs. Compare these two choices. Which one do you prefer? Support your answer with specific details.;When people move to another country, most likely, they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one. Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture, while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted. As for me, I would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country.On one hand, it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs. When people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures. The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture. For example, if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture. As a result, people understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country.On the other hand, keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination. When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country. The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society. One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969. They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it. While the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working. Although being much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination. Their houses and private cars were buried by local people, because the locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs. If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated.All in all, the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country, which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner, and assimilate to a new culture.;When individuals relocate to a new country, they often encounter the pivotal choice of either embracing the customs and traditions of their new environment or adhering to the ones of their homeland. This decision can significantly impact their integration and overall experience in the new society.On one hand, adopting the customs of the new country allows for smoother assimilation. Embracing local traditions and norms can foster a sense of belonging and facilitate connections with the locals. When individuals participate in their new culture—be it through language, festivals, or daily rituals—they are likely to create alliances and friendships that can ease the challenges of transition. This engagement can lead to opportunities in various aspects of life, including employment, education, and community involvement. Ultimately, following the new customs may enhance one’s experience, making it easier to navigate through the complexities of a foreign land.Conversely, maintaining one’s original customs and refusing to accept the new ones can produce a sense of identity and community among those who share similar backgrounds. This inclination to uphold familiar traditions can be comforting, especially in the face of the unknown. However, it often results in a self-imposed isolation that could hinder integration. When individuals insist on retaining their cultural practices, they may inadvertently establish themselves as a distinct group, potentially leading to misunderstandings or a lack of acceptance from the broader society. Such an attitude can create cultural rifts and may perpetuate stereotypes, causing both the immigrants and the locals to miss out on rich shared experiences.In conclusion, the choice between following new customs or holding onto one’s original traditions is pivotal for immigrants. While assimilating into a new culture can ease acceptance and foster connections, maintaining one’s cultural identity can also be a significant source of support. Ultimately, the best approach may lie in finding a balance that respects both heritage and new beginnings, fostering a more enriched experience in a diverse world.
212;Is it more important to be able to ework with a group of people on ta tem or to work independently? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, as the world is getting smaller, we need to be able to cooperate. Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success. Despite the importance of working in team, I still believe that the capability of working independly is more significant.Of course, effective cooperation can make things easier and faster, but in many important cases when team-working is not possible, the ability to work alone will help. The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working. Let's imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people, but you have no experience of working alone, standardized tests such as SAT, TOEFL may be your nightmares. Testing is a very important aspect of life, and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team. Therefore, if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college, acing your school's final tests, you should consider learning to work on your own.Moreover, the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people. Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas. Everybody in a team must have his/her own opinion first, then discuss them with other members. When we work in team, we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate. When everyone in a team can come up with his/her own ideas, working in team will definitely more effective.In conclusion, working with a group a people and working individually are all important. Both skills are necessary for a successful life. Nevertheless, the capablity of working alone is the foundation for the skill to work in team and plays a significant role in a lot of situations.;In today’s increasingly collaborative world, the emphasis on teamwork is often highlighted as a crucial skill for success. While it is undeniable that collaborating with others can lead to innovative ideas and solutions, I believe that the ability to work independently is even more significant, especially when it comes to personal achievements in academic settings. One primary reason for this perspective stems from the nature of certain assessments. Many educational systems employ standardized tests and final examinations that require students to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding individually. In these instances, the ability to concentrate, analyze information, and articulate thoughts without the aid of peers is vital. A student who has honed their independent study skills is far more likely to excel in these high-stakes situations, ultimately paving the way for exceptional academic achievements.Furthermore, the process of self-directed learning fosters a deeper understanding of the material. When students engage with content independently, they are forced to confront their weaknesses and strengths, making the learning process more meaningful. This introspective journey encourages critical thinking and problem-solving skills that cannot always be fully developed in a group setting, where distractions and varying paces can impede progress. Moreover, independence cultivates resilience. The challenges and obstacles faced during solo study sessions build a student’s confidence and problem-solving aptitude, equipping them with critical skills that extend beyond academics. In preparation for college, where students must navigate unstructured environments and deadlines without peer support, these skills become paramount.In conclusion, while teamwork plays an essential role in various contexts, the capability to work alone is a fundamental skill that leads to outstanding individual achievements. As students prepare for future challenges, they should prioritize developing their independent working abilities to ensure success in both their academic and personal endeavors.
214;Do you agree that people should have hobbies and do physical activities that are very different from one's work?;"Whether or not people should have hobbies and do physical activities has been a controversial question. Different people have different ideas. Some people think we should focus on our jobs, but I don't agree with them. Having one's own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits.First, having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit. Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze, so doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted. My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company. He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise. When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend, he made up his mind to loose weight. He started to jog every morning. After a moth, he is thinner and finds a girlfriend.Also, doing something for a long time can be boring, having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind. For example, at school, students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class. Humans are not robots; we can't keep working for twenty-four hours. Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries.Last, we should develop at least one personal hobby, not to show off, but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured. Playing musical instrument is a good way, I can play classical guitar. When I meet difficulties in studies, I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves. It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence.Although it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies, but doing so can bring us a healthy body, a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness. Hence, I think it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work.";In today’s fast-paced world, many individuals prioritize their jobs as the cornerstone of their lives, often neglecting the significance of having hobbies and engaging in physical activities. I firmly believe that dedicating time to hobbies and recreational pursuits is crucial for maintaining overall well-being and achieving a balanced life.First and foremost, physical activities are essential for keeping fit and healthy. Engaging in sports or outdoor activities not only helps in maintaining physical health but also contributes to mental clarity, reducing stress levels. A sedentary lifestyle, often dominated by work, can lead to a myriad of health issues. Therefore, incorporating physical activity into one’s routine is vital for both physical and mental wellness.Moreover, focusing solely on a job for extended periods can lead to boredom and burnout. Humans are inherently diverse beings, and engaging in various activities can refresh the mind and rejuvenate creativity. Hobbies provide an essential escape from the monotonous grind of work, offering new challenges and experiences that can inspire and motivate us to excel in our professional pursuits.Additionally, pursuing hobbies like playing a musical instrument can serve as an excellent outlet for emotional expression, particularly during times of stress or sadness. Music has a profound ability to convey feelings that words often cannot. When faced with challenges at work or personal life, turning to an instrument can provide therapeutic relief, allowing individuals to channel their emotions constructively.In conclusion, while having a strong work ethic is essential, it is equally important to carve out time for hobbies and physical activities. They not only contribute to our physical fitness but also refresh our minds and help us manage our emotions. A balanced approach to life that embraces both work and leisure ultimately leads to a richer, more fulfilling existence.
215;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.;The population explosion results in the high demands of transportation. Many countries have suffered from pollution, noisy and casualty for a long time. From my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons.First and foremost, we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents. The buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia. Moreover, the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing. Most importantly, there are many accidents happening on the roads. For example, in my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents. Each year, Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan.Secondly, investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work. Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads. For instance, I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home. It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour. In contrast, if the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions. Last but not least, spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality. All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes. Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried. We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities. What's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier.In a nutshell, the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable. I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing.;Pollution, noise, and casualties have plagued many countries for decades, resulting in significant health and environmental concerns. Among the various approaches to tackle these challenges, I believe that improving roads and highways stands out as the most effective solution for three crucial reasons: enhancing traffic flow, reducing emissions, and increasing safety.First and foremost, better-designed roads and highways can significantly improve traffic flow. Traffic congestion is a major contributor to both air pollution and noise. When vehicles are stuck in traffic, they consume more fuel and produce higher levels of emissions. By investing in road infrastructure that reduces bottlenecks and optimizes traffic management, cities can ensure smoother flow and less idling, thereby decreasing the overall pollution levels in urban areas. Secondly, improved road infrastructure can lead to a decrease in vehicle emissions. Upgrading roads with modern materials and designs can make them more efficient for vehicles. For example, dedicated lanes for public transportation can encourage commuters to opt for buses or trains over single-occupancy cars, thus reducing the number of vehicles on the road. Furthermore, incorporating green technologies, such as electric vehicle charging stations and smart traffic lights, can facilitate cleaner transportation options and further mitigate air pollution.Lastly, enhancing road safety is paramount in reducing casualties on our streets. Poorly maintained roads often contribute to accidents, injuries, and fatalities. By implementing better signage, improved lighting, and pedestrian-friendly designs, we can foster a safer environment for all road users. Additionally, the construction of more bike lanes and walking paths encourages healthier, alternative modes of transport, further reducing the risk of accidents.In conclusion, improving roads and highways is a multifaceted solution that can yield significant benefits in combating pollution, minimizing noise, and reducing casualties. By prioritizing investments in infrastructure, countries can create safer and healthier environments for their citizens while addressing the pressing issues of pollution and urban life.
216;Some people believe that the best way of learning life is by listening to the advice of family and friends. Other people believe that the best way of learning about life is through personal experience. Compare the advantages of these two different ways of learning about life. Which do you think is preferable?;Life is full of challenges, difficulties and unexpected obstacles. Therefore, learning about life, which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed. Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience. Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages.On one hand, the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter. Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life. And friends, people who are the same generation with you, they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you, which is not. By listening to your family and friends advice, you can definitely avoid many unexpected things.On the other hand, finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature. For one thing, there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don't experience it by yourself. For example, a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous. If you did as he told, you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely. In addition, family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time. You will grow to be dependent and reliant. In contrast, free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose.According to myself, both ways are good, but I prefer the latter. It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable. I believe that experiencing the real life by myself, I could learn more than just obey the advice. Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves, why don't the younger try to do the same?In summary, each way learning life has its own benefits. But to me, learning about life through personal experience seems more appropriate.;Life presents us with a myriad of experiences and lessons that shape who we are. Two main avenues through which we learn about life include listening to the advice of family and friends, and learning through personal experience. Each of these approaches has its own distinct advantages, and in my opinion, both are valuable in their own right.Listening to the advice of family and friends offers a realistic perspective on life’s challenges. Those close to us often have insights gained from their own experiences, and their advice can serve as a guiding light. They may point out potential pitfalls, offer solutions, or simply provide reassurance during difficult times. For instance, hearing my parents’ stories about their failures and successes has equipped me with wisdom that I would not have easily discerned on my own. This collective knowledge helps to frame real-life situations, allowing me to make informed decisions.On the other hand, personal experience is unparalleled in its ability to teach profound lessons. When we venture out into the world, making decisions and erred along the way, we encounter situations that mold our character and worldview. This form of learning fosters resilience, independence, and a deeper understanding of ourselves. I find that the lessons learned through my own mistakes stick with me far more than those simply recounted by others. By actively engaging with life, I feel a sense of authenticity that listening alone cannot provide.In conclusion, both listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience have their merits. While the former offers valuable insights and a realistic framework, the latter cultivates personal growth and resilience. For me, a balanced approach that incorporates both methods enriches my understanding of life and ultimately shapes a more holistic perspective.
217;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.;Everyone has happy moments during their life. These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood. In my opinion, childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.First, in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood. They do not have to worry about bills, jobs, how would their life be in the future. They just worry about two things: to have fun, learn and be happy. A child's daily life is school, playing and sleeping. For example, when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood. Moreover, I did not have to worry about costs and other things, I just had fun and learned. Also, people are most creative when they were children, children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy.Second, childhood is the period where people go to school and learn. Therefore, school memories are one of the best memories in a person's life. There you learn, to find your first love, to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun. For example, my father's best moments in his life are in his school years. Moreover, he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories.In other words, childhood is, indeed, the most happiest moments in a person's life. There is only one life and one childhood and people should live their childhood thoroughly.;In my opinion, childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. This sentiment resonates deeply with many, as the experiences and emotions tied to our early years often reflect a sense of uncomplicated joy and innocence. During childhood, individuals generally experience a level of happiness that can be difficult to replicate in adulthood. Adult life often comes with responsibilities, stress, and the pressures of daily life, which can overshadow the carefree spirit that characterizes childhood.A child's daily routine typically revolves around three fundamental activities: school, play, and sleep. These activities create a balanced structure that fosters both learning and creativity. School introduces children to new ideas and knowledge, laying the groundwork for intellectual development, while play offers opportunities to explore their imagination and form social connections. The simplicity of these activities—learning, laughing, and resting—provides an environment where joy is naturally derived from exploration rather than achievement.Moreover, children are arguably the most creative during their formative years. Their imaginative capacity knows no bounds, a stark contrast to the often rigid, structured thinking that can develop in adulthood. Children invent games, tell fantastical stories, and create entire worlds from simple objects. This unfiltered creativity is essential for their emotional and intellectual growth and is often stifled in later years due to societal expectations and responsibilities.In conclusion, childhood stands out as a time of unparalleled happiness and creativity. The innocence of youth, characterized by playful discovery and a vibrant imagination, offers a unique form of joy that often eludes adults. As we grow older, it is crucial to hold onto those memories and aspects of childhood that remind us of the simple pleasures in life, allowing ourselves moments of playfulness and creativity amidst our grown-up responsibilities.
218;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;With technology advances, food has become easier to prepare in modern days. People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before. Also, instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals. These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent.First of all, people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming. For instance, such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job. On the other hand, more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts.At the second point, since food preparation has become easier and more convenient, it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home. People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like. More men, on the other hand, are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before. This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases.In conclusion, the time-saving, simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities, more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals. Of course, there may be some other perspectives that I neglected to fully consider. Nevertheless, for the reasons that I have presented above, I would assert that this change has improved our life significantly.;"In the contemporary world, the advances in technology have significantly transformed the way we prepare food, making it easier and more convenient than ever before. Kitchen appliances like microwaves and toasters have revolutionized meal preparation, allowing individuals to cook their meals with minimal effort and time. This shift in cooking methods has had a profound impact on daily life, particularly for housewives who traditionally managed all aspects of meal preparation.Historically, cooking often involved lengthy and tedious processes, requiring hours of preparation and hands-on time. Chopping, boiling, and baking demanded not only skill but also significant mental and physical energy. However, the advent of modern kitchen appliances has streamlined these tasks. For instance, a microwave can reheat leftovers in a matter of minutes, while a toaster can quickly crisp bread to perfection. These appliances have effectively eliminated the need for prolonged cooking sessions, liberating many from the constraints of traditional culinary practices.This newfound efficiency brings about more than just convenience; it provides individuals, particularly housewives, with invaluable time that they can devote to other meaningful pursuits. With the pressure of meal preparation eased, housewives are now able to engage in activities that promote personal growth, such as education, creative hobbies, or even professional opportunities. As a result, technology has not only made cooking simpler but has also enriched the lives of many by allowing them to explore passions that might have otherwise been sidelined due to the demands of household responsibilities.In conclusion, technological advancements in kitchen appliances have revolutionized food preparation, making it more accessible and efficient. This change has liberated many from the monotonous routines of cooking, providing them with precious time to pursue other interests and endeavors, thereby enhancing overall quality of life."
219;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Learning to be independent is essential for young adults. However, how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue. In my point of view, staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult. My opinion is based on creating memories with parents, saving money, and taking advice from parents.First of all, one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents. The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age. When having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown. If he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together. All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by. Thus, I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile.Furthermore, living at home costs less than living outside. Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home. Therefore, he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents. Moreover, another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings. Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be. In a word, the parents can save money, if their children live with them longer.The third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother's suggestions. When in dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand. They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way. If the parents do not help him immediately, he would have to suffer more pain. Hence, taking advice from parents, the young adult can go through obstacles easily.To sum up, living with parents longer brings about memories with parents, less cost, and advice from parents. Hence, staying longer with parents is a better choice.;Living with parents longer has become a common trend among young adults, and this phenomenon brings with it an array of benefits that extend beyond mere financial savings. One of the most significant advantages is the opportunity to create lasting memories with parents. Living under the same roof enables daily interactions, shared meals, and participation in family traditions, which fosters stronger bonds. These moments—whether it’s cooking together, watching movies, or simply having conversations—become cherished memories that enrich family life and deepen relationships.In addition to emotional benefits, living at home provides substantial financial advantages. Young adults often face rising costs of living, particularly in urban areas where housing prices are prohibitive. By residing with their parents, they can significantly decrease their expenses, allowing them to save money for future endeavors such as education, buying a home, or starting a business. This financial cushion eases the burden of student loans and monthly rent payments, promoting a more stable financial future. Many young adults also choose to contribute to household expenses, which encourages financial literacy and responsibility without the overwhelming pressure of managing their own household.Moreover, living with parents can provide invaluable advice and guidance. Parents often possess a wealth of life experience and knowledge that can help their children navigate the complexities of adulthood. Whether it's career advice, financial planning, or relational insights, having parents nearby means access to a support system that can guide young adults in making informed decisions. This relationship not only fortifies the family dynamic but also equips the younger generation with the necessary tools to thrive independently.In conclusion, living with parents longer cultivates meaningful memories, facilitates substantial savings, and offers essential guidance. Ultimately, this arrangement benefits both parents and children, creating a harmonious environment where financial, emotional, and practical support is readily available.
220;Do you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and example to explain your answer.;Some people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization, which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily. However, I do not agree with them. I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings. It is very crucial for learning. It helps animals out of extinction. Also, it is a interesting travel location.First of all, the zoo gives humans new knowledge. When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals, what should you do if there were no zoo? Inevitably, the zoo is the important place for innate learning. The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically. They are able to observe animals' behaviors and features. Moreover, practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class. Besides, researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals.Secondly, the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats. In the zoo, there is not so harmful as a forest. They, fed by zookeepers, do not need to find food themselves. Furthermore, we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife.Last but not least, because of all weird, acute, and beautiful animals in the zoo, it can be a great tourist attraction. There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely. If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists, it will receive a great deal of money. That also make money flow, and then economics become better. It benefits to a certain country. In conclusion, the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction, but also helps people around the world have better lives. I firmly believe that the zoo is so useful for the earth.;"The role of zoos in modern society extends far beyond mere entertainment; they serve as crucial educational resources, conservation hubs, and significant tourist attractions. One of the primary functions of a zoo is to facilitate learning about diverse animal species and their habitats. Zoos provide a unique opportunity for individuals of all ages to observe animals up close, fostering a connection that textbooks often cannot replicate. Through guided tours, educational programs, and interactive exhibits, visitors gain invaluable insights into animal behavior, biology, and the environmental challenges that many species face today. This hands-on learning experience can inspire future generations to advocate for wildlife conservation and environmental stewardship.Moreover, zoos play a pivotal role in preventing animal extinction. Many species are at risk due to habitat loss, poaching, and climate change. By participating in breeding programs, zoos work to maintain genetic diversity and create stable populations of endangered species. For example, successful initiatives for animals such as the California condor and the black-footed ferret have led to their reintroduction into the wild, illustrating the vital role zoos play in conservation efforts. In addition to research and breeding, zoos also engage in global efforts to protect natural habitats and educate the public about the importance of biodiversity.Lastly, zoos are significant tourist attractions, drawing millions of visitors each year. This influx of tourists not only supports the local economy but also raises awareness about important conservation issues. By merging entertainment with education and conservation, zoos create a memorable experience for visitors while promoting a deeper understanding of the natural world.In summary, zoos are indispensable institutions that enhance learning, support animal conservation, and contribute to economic growth through tourism. Their role in educating the public about wildlife and fostering a sense of responsibility for the planet's biodiversity cannot be overstated."
221;Parents are the best teacher for young children. To what extend do you argee or disagree?;It is obvious that parents are the first teachers who teach babies how to walk and speak and make children to become a good person. Moreover, parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children's future life.First, children are taught basic things, which influence their whole life, by their parents. As a baby, they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents. Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that. Consequently, parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby's little mind.Second, parents train their child how to become a good person. They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way. On the one hand, it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person. On the other hand, children are shown how to behave well with others. This seems to be easy but this can influence positively their future children and makes children's behavior better before they face the real world.Third, it is clear that parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children. Thus, they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children. Unlike a professional, parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life. In fact, parents' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life.In conclusion, parents are really the best teachers who give us much knowledge and advice. Based on love, they always try their best to make good condition for their children development in order to prepare children's future life.;"Parents are undeniably the first teachers in a child's life, embodying the roles of educators, mentors, and role models. From the moment a baby enters the world, it is the parents who initiate the learning process. They teach their children fundamental skills—how to walk, speak, and navigate the intricacies of social interaction. These lessons are not merely about physical abilities; they serve as the foundation for a child’s emotional and social development. Through love and nurturing, parents instill important values that shape their children's character and guide them on the path to becoming good individuals.The influence of parents extends far beyond physical milestones. The practice of speaking to a child, reading stories, and engaging in conversation fosters language skills and intellectual curiosity. As children listen to their parents’ voices, they begin to understand the power of communication, learning both words and the meaning behind them. This early exposure to language creates a springboard for future learning and enhances cognitive abilities.Moreover, parents strive to create an environment conducive to their children’s development. They make sacrifices and effortfully arrange their schedules to ensure that their offspring have access to educational resources, extracurricular activities, and emotional support. This deliberate commitment stems from a profound love that parents hold for their children—they wish for them to thrive and succeed in the future. In conclusion, parents play a pivotal role in shaping their children's lives from infancy through early childhood. By teaching them basic life skills and instilling essential values, they lay the groundwork for a future filled with opportunities and ethical decision-making. The unyielding love and dedication of parents create a nurturing atmosphere, empowering children to grow into compassionate and responsible adults, fully prepared to tackle the challenges of life."
222;Some people say that television has a bad influence to young children. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we have undergone many technology innovations such as Tv. Many people say that television has negative effects on children, since it can be violent or inappropriate for children. However, I strongly believe that television has more positive effects than negative effects. There are two reasons to support my idea.First of all, television has useful and educational programs. Not only the up-to-date news, but also there are many programs which has educational purposes. If children can use those programs wisely, they can learn many information from it. For example, in Korea, there's program called EBS. It is targeted for children to teenager. We can study subjects through EBS lecture. Also, there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea. Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects. In addition, Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses. There are many Tv programs such as sports programs. Many children have a lot of stresses recently, since they have so much pressure about study. When they are watching sports programs, it's easy to relieve those stresses. As an example, I got too much stress from the school. So, I was quite aggressive, however. After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan, the stress was gone. Instead, this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school, since it helped me to relieve my stress.In conclusion, of course, the television can have violent programs, however, if children can use Tv programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects. Now that, it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children. For these reasons, I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children.;Television has long been a focal point of debate when it comes to its influence on children. Critics often highlight the negative effects, particularly citing that many programs contain violence or inappropriate content that can adversely impact young minds. Indeed, concerns about desensitization to violence, poor behavior modeling, and exposure to unsuitable themes are valid. However, it is essential to recognize that television, when approached wisely, can serve as a powerful educational and developmental tool, yielding more positive effects than negative ones.When children engage with TV programs thoughtfully, they can access a treasure trove of educational content. Channels dedicated to learning, such as PBS Kids or National Geographic, not only entertain but also impart valuable lessons about science, history, and culture. Documentaries and nature programs can nurture a sense of curiosity about the world, fostering a desire to learn and explore beyond the screen. Furthermore, well-crafted children's shows can enhance literacy skills, teaching vocabulary and comprehension through engaging narratives.In addition, television can facilitate family bonding. Programs designed for multi-generational viewership allow families to come together, stimulating discussions about themes and messages in the shows. This shared experience can forge stronger family ties, as it encourages communication and collaboration on interpretations of what they watch.Additionally, in an increasingly digital world, television can serve as a bridge to socialization. Children can engage in conversations with peers about popular shows, thus developing their social skills and cultural literacy. In conclusion, while it is undeniable that television can present risks for children, the key lies in mindful consumption. With appropriate guidance from parents and caregivers, children can harness the positive aspects of television as an educational resource and a means of social engagement, ultimately resulting in a more enriching experience than one filled with negativity.
223;Businesses should hire employees for their entire lives. Do you agree or disagree. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;Many entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working. From my perspective, those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date. I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons. First and foremost, various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish. The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job, but regularly give out creative and novel ideas. What's more, the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge. Therefore, the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards. More importantly, they have activeness, inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly. These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not.Secondly, the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time. At a certain time, they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life. Thereafter, the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also. Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones. The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed, so this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise. Last but not least, the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment. In my opinion, the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue. It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living. Furthermore, the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas. In a nutshell, varied characteristics of various people, feeling tired of having the same occupation and solving the unemployed problem drive me to agree with the statement that the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life. I believe that the brilliant bosses are conscious of the need for giving opportunities to diverse employees.;In today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, the notion that hiring employees for their entire lives guarantees productivity and efficiency is increasingly seen as conservative and outdated. From my perspective, businesses ought to reconsider this assumption and adopt more flexible employment strategies. There are three key reasons supporting this view: adaptability, diverse talent acquisition, and employee motivation.Firstly, adaptability is vital in a world where market dynamics and technological advancements change at an unprecedented rate. Businesses that rely on lifelong employment risk stagnation and an inability to pivot in response to new trends or challenges. By embracing a more dynamic workforce—one that includes freelancers, part-time workers, and contractual employees—companies can quickly adjust their staffing needs to align with current market demands. This flexibility enables organizations to remain competitive and innovative.Secondly, hiring for the long term can stifle diversity in talent acquisition. When businesses commit to lifetime employment, they may overlook the importance of bringing in new perspectives and skills. A rotating workforce allows companies to access a broader range of ideas, expertise, and experiences, nurturing creativity and fostering a culture of innovation. This influx of fresh talent can lead to enhanced problem-solving and improved overall performance within teams.Lastly, the motivational aspects of employment cannot be ignored. Employees who know they are not tied to their roles for life may feel more empowered and engaged. The prospect of career growth or change fosters an environment where individuals strive to improve their skills and contribute meaningfully to the organization. In contrast, the notion of lifetime employment can breed complacency, hindering both personal and professional development.In conclusion, the idea that lifelong employment ensures productivity and efficiency is an outdated mindset. Embracing flexibility, promoting diversity, and enhancing employee motivation are essential for businesses striving to thrive in an increasingly unpredictable world. Companies that adapt to modern workforce trends will ultimately secure their success and sustainability in the future.
224;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.;"I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one's life. It's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think.Starting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives. We are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave. Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community. But during our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to. Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult. Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day. Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you. There are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see. Therefore, childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most.Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child. Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination. In adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination.Childhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives. It's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults. In an ideal world with less boundaries, social judgement and more freedom of thought, things could be different; but since this is not the case, it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days.";"Childhood is often regarded as the happiest period of one's life, and for good reason. This stage, typically characterized by innocence and curiosity, is filled with moments of joy, surprise, and boundless imagination. Unlike the responsibilities and pressures that come with adulthood, children experience life with a sense of wonder that allows them to truly appreciate the simplest of pleasures.One of the most distinguishing features of childhood is the propensity for surprise. Every new experience offers a chance to learn and grow, whether it be the discovery of a new animal, the excitement of a birthday party, or the joy of the first snowfall. Such moments are marked by genuine excitement that often fades with age. This ability to be amazed by the world around them enriches children's lives and creates lasting memories that they carry with them into adulthood.Additionally, childhood offers a unique freedom to imagine and express oneself freely. Children are not bound by societal expectations or the need to conform; they can wander through the realms of their thoughts and fantasies without restriction. This imaginative capacity allows them to create elaborate stories, play pretend, and envision possibilities that often defy reality. It is in these moments of pure creativity and self-expression that children find a profound sense of joy and fulfillment.In conclusion, childhood is a remarkable phase that serves as a foundation for happiness, rich with surprise and freedom of thought. The ability to experience the world with awe and to express oneself without fear solidifies this period as a highlight in one’s life. While adulthood brings its own set of joys and achievements, the imaginative spirit and carefree essence of childhood remain unparalleled, often leaving one longing for the simplicity and happiness of those early years."
225;Learning about the past has no value on for those of us living the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Many people think that ""Past has nothing to do with present, as time never stops, the next generations are completely different from the predecessors"". Although it is true that life changes rapidly, there are many things in the past that we can learn about, such as mistakes, success and knowledge in many fields of study. First of all, the predecessors' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past. As everyone's life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare, we all should learn about other's mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones. Each mistake, from the smallest to the bigger one, is a treasure of experience, which, if we can make full use of, will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life. Therefore, past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times.Secondly, people's success in the past is as significant as those mistakes. If the predecessors' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals, others' accomplishment can be served as the direct way. By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets, we have the chance to make those mine, put them into practice and, of course, be successful like them. For instance, Edison's statement ""Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration"" is still helpful for everyone today, and probably in the future. Last but not least, the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge, inventions. If it had not been for those knowledge in the past, we could never be as modern as today. How can America be the world's leading country if Columbus did not accidentally discover it in his search for India. How can the comtemporary scientists study the earth's gravity without the apple which fall on Newton's head. They are only some of many precious knowledge that the past presents us. We cannot ignore them in any way.All in all, the past's mistakes, success and knowledge all have crucial impact on people's lives today. We should make full use of the past, instead of ignoring it, for a better and brighter future.";The concept of time as an unstoppable force often leads many to believe that the past holds no relevance to the present. However, this perception is a shortsighted one, for the past serves as a profound reservoir of lessons, insights, and experiences that can significantly shape our present and future. Ignoring it would be a grave error, as history is replete with examples of beyond value, whether they be mistakes, successes, or knowledge gained across various fields of study.First and foremost, our past actions, both personal and collective, are rich in lessons that can inform our decision-making processes. For instance, history teaches us about the consequences of policies implemented by governments, such as those that led to economic turmoil or social injustice. By examining these occurrences, we can avoid making similar errors, fostering a society that learns and evolves rather than repeats its mistakes.Similarly, past successes offer templates for achievement. Innovations driven by the intellectual breakthroughs of thinkers, scientists, and artists throughout history continue to inspire current and future generations. The Renaissance, for example, exemplified a burst of creativity and rediscovery that reshaped art, science, and philosophy. Learning from the successes and failures of the past equips us with the knowledge necessary to navigate contemporary challenges with greater confidence and creativity.Furthermore, the accumulation of knowledge across various fields—be it science, literature, or social studies—anchors us in understanding where we came from, thus fostering a sense of identity and continuity. By honoring and utilizing this wealth of information, we not only pay homage to the past but also empower ourselves to create a brighter future.In conclusion, while time may never stop, our engagement with the past can provide us with invaluable tools for progress. Embracing and learning from our history is essential for making informed choices and building a future that benefits from the wisdom of experiences that have come before us. Rather than dismissing the past as irrelevant, we should harness its lessons to enlighten our way forward.
226;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;Space exploration, for discovery of out of space, has been possible for human in the 20th century. The United state and Russia are the important countries that spend large budgets for the research of this subject. In my opinion, spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future. Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget, while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living. In 20th century, although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets, but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now. In during history, our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity. Therefore, it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets. Space exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war. In the future, many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles. In the past, the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union. Both countries tried to send man to the moon and show their power to each other. As a result, space exploration will use as a military power for many countries.In summary, spending budget for space exploring is not the waste budget, because it may helps to save civilization of humanity. Although exploring space used for discovery of other planets, nowadays most of governments have used many rockets for military purposes and therefore the purposes of exploring space has altered.;Space exploration has been a significant milestone in human history, especially in the 20th century when technological advancements enabled us to reach beyond our planet. This era marked the beginning of humanity's quest to understand the vast universe. From the launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union in 1957 to the Apollo moon missions, strides in space exploration have not only expanded our knowledge of the cosmos but also transformed our understanding of Earth and its environment.In my opinion, allocating budget for space exploration is a crucial investment for the future of humanity. As we confront challenges such as climate change, resource depletion, and overpopulation, exploring outer space holds the potential for crucial discoveries. For instance, the study of other planets and celestial bodies could unveil new resources or provide insights into sustainable living practices. Additionally, the development of technology for space missions often leads to innovations that can be applied to solve problems on Earth, from communication technologies to advancements in materials science.However, it is essential not to overlook the historical context of space exploration, particularly its militarization during the Cold War. The competition between the United States and the Soviet Union in space was as much about demonstrating technological superiority and military power as it was about peaceful exploration. Space became a theater for showcasing national strength, with developments in rocket technology directly influencing military capabilities.Despite this militaristic backdrop, the benefits of continued space exploration are undeniable. It can serve as a unifying force for humanity, fostering international cooperation in the pursuit of knowledge. As we look towards the future, investing in space exploration is not merely about reaching new worlds but rather about ensuring the survival and advancement of life on our own planet. By exploring the cosmos, we not only seek answers to existential questions but also work to secure a sustainable future for generations to come.
227;Do you agree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.Ê;"Television is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day. Besides, watching television has some cons and at the same time has very good pros. However, while some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families, I believe it has done the opposite. I think TV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering. In addition Modern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people.First, it's true watching TV take a lot of your day, nevertheless it makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs.Second, people like having meals while they are watching TV. Families usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends. For example my friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights. It was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema. Third, TV can be one of communication ways. Moreover, TV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV, WDTV using Skype, tango and other apps. In addition Teenagers can play games online with their friends; therefore we can communicate with each other through TV. To sum up, TV may take some of your time away from your family and friends but it can also make family get together and help to get in conversation. As well as it's one way of recent communications, based on that I think TV helps you to get connected with people.";"Television is one of the greatest innovations of modern technology, profoundly influencing our daily lives. It serves not only as a source of entertainment but also as a medium that informs, educates, and connects us with the world. While some critics argue that television has devastated communication among friends and families, I firmly believe that it has, in fact, enhanced these interactions.Television acts as a catalyst for conversation, providing common ground for family and friends to engage with one another. Viewing programs, whether they are dramas, documentaries, or news, often leads to discussions that might not occur otherwise. Imagine a family sitting together to watch a gripping documentary on climate change; this experience could spark meaningful conversations about environmental responsibility, personal actions, and community involvement. Thus, television not only provides material for discussion but also creates shared experiences that can strengthen bonds.Moreover, TV shows and films often depict a wide array of cultures, ideologies, and lifestyles that encourage viewers to understand and empathize with others. Through storytelling, television has the power to bridge gaps and foster dialogues among diverse groups of people. It can become a platform for discussing pressing societal issues, thereby encouraging a more informed and vibrant discourse within families and communities.In addition, many families use television as a tool for quality time. Family members may gather to watch a favorite show or film, creating moments of joy and laughter that can enhance emotional connections. This shared activity can serve as an alternative to more traditional modes of communication, where face-to-face interactions may sometimes be hindered by busy lifestyles.In conclusion, television should not be viewed merely as a distraction. Rather, it is a vital source of interaction and understanding that fosters deeper communication among friends and families. By facilitating discussions and shared experiences, television enriches our collective relationships and promotes a more connected society."
228;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship.Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship. It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result. However, I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend, although mistake is terrible. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my opinion. First of all, a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever. Anybody does not remember mistakes. If someone remembers mistake, he or she has a closed mind. I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly. For example, my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift. However, I forgot about it just after two days, and I felt at peace with him. Some people might say I am silly, but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship. Second, Everybody makes mistake. However, if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake, there will be no friends around you. I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake, we will need to end a friendship. However, when the mistake friend made was not a big problem, we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life. According to a research, 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend.I think that a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big because friendship is forever and gift our life.;"The debate over whether it is preferable to let a friend make a mistake rather than intervene and risk damaging the friendship is a nuanced topic. In my opinion, allowing a friend to err can ultimately be more beneficial for both individuals involved. This stance is supported by two key reasons: the value of personal growth and the importance of maintaining autonomy in relationships.Firstly, allowing a friend to make mistakes is essential for their personal growth and development. Mistakes are often powerful teachers; they offer invaluable lessons that can shape one's character and decision-making skills. When friends face the consequences of their decisions, they gain insights that may not be possible through mere advice or suggestions. By stepping back, we empower our friends to confront challenges on their own, fostering resilience, self-reflection, and maturity. Supporting them from a distance can also enhance their problem-solving abilities and help them navigate similar situations in the future, ultimately contributing to their personal development.Secondly, intervening in a friend's choices can create an imbalance in the relationship by undermining their autonomy. Each person has their own set of values and beliefs, and it is vital to respect these, even if we think our perspective is better. Taking action to prevent a mistake may result in resentment, as it can come across as patronizing or controlling. Allowing a friend the freedom to make their own choices reinforces respect within the friendship, promoting a healthy dynamic where both parties feel valued and trusted. In conclusion, while it is tempting to intervene in a friend’s potentially misguided choices, allowing them to make mistakes can be more beneficial. By fostering personal growth and respecting autonomy, we contribute to stronger and more mature friendships that are rooted in mutual trust and understanding. Ultimately, these relationships thrive on the lessons learned through experience, rather than the avoidance of conflict."
229;One of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;Nowadays, the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before, parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them, just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods. Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that, for example, asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves. In my views, I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons.First of all, when children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents. Thus, it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money. Take me as an example, when I was 16, I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own. At the beginning of the semester, I was told to buy a text book. Unfortunately, I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend. Therefore, I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money, and that did influence me in my life now.Secondly, by taking a part-time job, they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done. For instance, if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him. To compare with the school life, they might suffer only a small punishment at school. Under the circumstances, he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work.In conclusion, to help their children to adapt adult life, parents should let them experience it as much as they can. Due to the reasons given above, to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life.;In my view, encouraging teenage children to take part-time jobs is one of the best ways to prepare them for adult life. First and foremost, working allows adolescents to earn their own money instead of relying solely on pocket money from their parents. This transition is significant as it fosters a sense of independence and financial literacy. By managing their own finances, teenagers can learn the value of money, budgeting, and prioritizing their spending, which are essential skills for adulthood.Moreover, a part-time job instills a sense of responsibility and accountability. Unlike the relaxed environment of home, the workplace has its own set of rules and expectations that must be followed. If a student frequently arrives late or fails to meet deadlines, they may face consequences such as reduced pay or even termination. These real-world repercussions emphasize the importance of punctuality and reliability, qualities that are vital in any professional setting.

230;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay.;It’s certainly better for children to grow up in a big city. Of course you need to choose a good neighborhood. I hold this belief because of two main reasons, academic and social reasons.Some people thinks that if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video-game, but this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did. My friends and I used to play soccer, bike, climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day. We did play video-games, but that wasn't our main activity. In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do.I have a friend that grew up in the countryside. He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university. This is another downside of growing up in the countryside. In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology.Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience, you won’t know a lot of people, there are gossips everywhere, and your life will be really limited. If someday I have children, I’m absolutely sure that they will grow up in a good neighborhood of a big city and they will be very happy about it.;Living in a big city offers a diverse array of experiences that shapes individuals and broadens their perspectives. The urban landscape is a melting pot of various cultures, ideas, and lifestyles. In a city, one can find endless activities, from attending concerts, art exhibitions, and sporting events to exploring a wide range of international cuisines. The rich tapestry of city life not only provides entertainment, but also fosters creativity and innovation as people from different backgrounds come together and share their ideas.In contrast, life in the countryside can be markedly different. While the tranquility and natural beauty of rural areas are appealing, they often come with limitations. Educational opportunities may be scarce, requiring students to study rigorously to pass entrance exams for universities. This competitive environment can be daunting, especially when compared to the more accessible and diverse educational pathways available in cities. Additionally, the pervasive nature of gossip in smaller communities can stifle individuality and foster an atmosphere of conformity. Such environments may restrict personal growth and exploration, leading to a more predictable and less dynamic lifestyle.As someone who values diversity and the multitude of experiences that come with city life, I envision a different upbringing for my future children. I believe that growing up in a city will provide them with the opportunities to meet various people, engage in stimulating activities, and cultivate a broad perspective on life. The exposure to different cultures, ideas, and lifestyles can immensely enrich their understanding of the world, making them more adaptable and open-minded individuals. In conclusion, while both city and countryside have their unique charms, I am resolute in my belief that my children will thrive in the vibrant and multifaceted environment that a big city has to offer. Their growth will be fostered through the endless possibilities that an urban setting presents.
231;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I completely agree that parents are the best teacher. Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children’s lives.Firstly, the things that parents say have great power to their child. More power than any friend or other adult could have. For example, if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn't do it, but his father told him/her that it was right, the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person, even if his father is wrong.Secondly, a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people, so their parents have more time to teach him/her than anybody else. They have more contact and more intimacy with their children. Lastly, children usually mirror themselves on their parents. That’s as important thing because even if the parents don’t intend to teach their children something, they are always observing and learning by themselves. So, if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad, his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad.All in all, I agree that parents are the greatest teachers and I think that they should be very careful with what they say and do in front of their child, because it can define who he is going to be.;"The influence of parents on a child's development is profound and far-reaching. From the earliest stages of life, children absorb and internalize the messages imparted by their parents. These messages often shape their perceptions of self-worth, relationships, and the world around them. The words of parents echo in their children’s minds, often holding more power than the opinions of friends or other adults.One of the primary reasons for this influence is the time spent together. Parents typically invest more hours of direct interaction with their children than any other influential figures in their lives. During formative years, this consistent presence fosters a strong bond, establishing trust and a secure space for learning. As a result, parents have the unique opportunity to teach their children essential life lessons, instilling values and beliefs through everyday conversations and experiences.Moreover, children are prone to mimicry; they often model their behavior and attitudes after those of their parents. This mirroring effect showcases the natural inclination of children to look up to their parents as role models. Whether it's language, habits, or emotional responses, children absorb these traits like sponges. When parents express confidence, kindness, or resilience, they inadvertently teach their children to adopt these qualities in their own lives. Conversely, negative messages or criticism can lead to deep-seated insecurities.In conclusion, the power of parental words should not be underestimated. The lessons embedded in their daily interactions create a foundation upon which children build their identities. A nurturing and supportive dialogue from parents can foster a child's self-esteem and emotional intelligence, leading to healthier relationships and successful futures. The lasting impression made by parents is more enduring than any external influence, highlighting the invaluable role they play in a child's life."
232;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;The Technology has developed a lot. With that development, food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to. With that change, people’s lives are a lot better for several reasons. Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook.Firstly, people normally have lots of things to do. Because of that, they don’t have much time to spend in the kitchen. But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome. For example, if an engineer needs to make a project, but he needs to deliver it tomorrow, he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch.Secondly, when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason, some time ago he/she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food, but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food. For example, if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions. Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time.All in all, that ease to prepare food has improved people’s lives. And that happened mainly because of the development of the technology. But people should be careful with what they eat, because some industrial foods are very bad for their health, so they should buy only food from well known brands.;The evolution of food preparation and consumption has significantly transformed the culinary landscape. With advancements in technology and food science, making meals has become easier and more efficient than ever before. Appliances like air fryers, pressure cookers, and sous-vide machines allow individuals to prepare a variety of dishes in a fraction of the time it once took. Moreover, the introduction of pre-packaged ingredients and meal kits has alleviated the burdens of grocery shopping and meal planning, enabling both novice cooks and busy professionals to enjoy delicious, homemade dishes with minimal effort.The flavor profiles of modern food have also experienced a remarkable enhancement. Advances in seasoning, marinades, and flavoring techniques allow even the simplest of ingredients to be transformed into gourmet meals. Commercial chefs and home cooks alike now have access to a wider array of exotic herbs and spices, allowing them to experiment with international cuisines and elevate their culinary creations. As a result, dining experiences are often more enjoyable, catering not only to the nutritional needs of individuals but also to their palate preferences.However, this new convenience comes with a caveat. While many industrial foods promise quick and tasty solutions, some of them pose significant health risks. Processed foods can be high in unhealthy fats, added sugars, and artificial preservatives, leading to a myriad of health concerns including obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. It is crucial for consumers to be discerning about their food choices and to prioritize whole, nutritious ingredients whenever possible. In conclusion, while the development of food preparation methods has made cooking easier and tastier, individuals must remain vigilant about their dietary choices. Emphasizing a balanced diet rich in natural foods will ensure that the pleasures of modern cooking do not come at the expense of one’s health. Thus, embracing both convenience and wellness is key in navigating today’s food landscape.
233;Students should be required to take regular standardized tests to prove that they are learning;The issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams. This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it. However, I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge.Firstly, standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students. For example some students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue. Therefore, exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students. In addition, many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them.Additionally, standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice. Since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, so they will never try to solve problems on their own. However, standardized tests offer them such chance. Thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides.Finally, I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students. In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively. I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don’t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them.Ultimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right. I belive this, due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students.;The debate over whether schools should require students to take regular standardized exams has proliferated in educational discourse, with proponents arguing for the multitude of benefits such assessments offer. Standardized exams provide a uniform framework, allowing teachers to fairly grade students based on a consistent set of criteria. Unlike subjective evaluation methods, which may be influenced by bias or differing grading philosophies, standardized tests present an objective metric that reflects a student’s knowledge and skills in a particular subject area. This objective measurement is crucial for ensuring equitable assessment across diverse classroom settings.Moreover, many teachers depend heavily on standardized exam results to formulate their grading systems. The reliance on these exams is often rooted in the desire to maintain a fair and quantifiable method for evaluating student performance. Standardized tests can help identify areas of strength and weakness, not only for individual students but also for entire classes. This approach aids educators in tailoring their instructional strategies to address gaps in understanding and learning outcomes, ultimately enhancing the overall educational experience.Critics of standardized testing may argue that these assessments can induce undue stress among students or fail to capture the full spectrum of a student's abilities. However, when utilized effectively, standardized exams should complement, not dominate, the assessment landscape. They can serve as valuable tools in conjunction with other evaluative measures, such as class participation, projects, and presentations. In conclusion, requiring students to take regular standardized exams is a substantial approach that benefits both educators and learners. It provides a fair, objective standard for assessment and informs teaching strategies. Thus, embracing standardized testing as part of a comprehensive evaluation system is essential to fostering an equitable and effective educational environment.
234;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars;"A famous proverb “Knowledge is power” has demonstrated the value of education. I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability. I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies, and this left them with only one choice, which is work.University is more likely to become a money making business, the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students. In today’s world education is getting expensive, and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission. Whereas, the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education, they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation, food, traveling, clothing, etc.Moreover, it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance, working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars, they need to concentrate on their studies. MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work, which takes their full concentration and surveys. The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities.Therefore, universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars; their message should be spread education, not making money, and motivate those scholars who want to get education. Their notion should be inspirational in such a way which makes our society educative and increase our literacy rate.";In today’s increasingly competitive world, the cost of education has skyrocketed, making it a significant financial burden for many students and their families. Rising tuition fees, coupled with the escalating costs of living, have marginalized access to traditional forms of education for a considerable portion of the population. As a result, a growing number of students are opting for self-financed education, a trend that reflects both the high demand for qualifications and the limited availability of scholarships and financial aid. Self-financed education can empower students by allowing them the flexibility to choose the course and institution that best fits their career goals. However, it also poses substantial risks, as students might embark on significant financial commitments without guaranteed outcomes in terms of employment or income. This dilemma underscores the urgent need for affordable education models.In response to these challenges, the notion of free education is gaining traction. The idea that education should be accessible to all, regardless of socioeconomic status, fosters inclusivity and equality. Scholars who may not have the financial means to afford tuition fees are particularly inspired by the possibility of free education. This immense privilege allows dedicated learners to focus entirely on their studies, thus maximizing their potential and contributing meaningfully to society. Moreover, free education promotes the concept of knowledge as a public good rather than a commodity. It can lead to a more educated workforce, reduced poverty levels, and increased innovation. In an era where education can determine one’s future, the inspiration and motivation derived from the prospect of free education can drive passionate students to unleash their capabilities and effect positive change in their communities. In conclusion, while self-financed education is an option today, the enduring dream of equitable, free education continues to inspire those who strive for a brighter future.
235;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?Ê;Although professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing, teaching, we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with, doing research. In my opinion, a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following.A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject. He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him/herself forward all the time. And then he or she can do better in teaching works. For instance, the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr. Yang who keeps in researching and reading. He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves. All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA, the excellent teacher.As for students, we can get what we want to know from textbooks, webs or teachers. But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted. If a professor doesn't get any researching works, he cannot give us the opportunity. In addition, a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time. He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions. That is good for both of the professor and students.Finally, all professors in the university are fortune of the society. They are the leaders almost in every fields of science, arts, culture and so on. Without their research, there will be no new technologies come out quickly. Without their research, there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing. Without their research, there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth.In conclusion, a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university. And it's worth to spend more time on it than on teaching.;Professors at universities are primarily recognized as educators, playing a crucial role in shaping the minds of students. However, one cannot overlook the equally significant responsibility of research that defines their professional lives. The balance between teaching and research is a contentious topic, but there are compelling reasons to argue that professors should devote more time to research activities than to classroom instruction.Firstly, engaging in research allows professors to remain at the forefront of their academic disciplines. Through active research, they contribute to the body of knowledge in their field, exploring new theories, methodologies, and applications. This continual engagement with cutting-edge insights not only enriches their understanding but also enhances the quality of education they provide. When professors incorporate their research findings into their teaching, students receive a nuanced perspective that extends beyond textbooks, fostering a deeper comprehension of the subject matter.Secondly, research endeavors are instrumental in promoting critical thinking and innovation among students. When professors conduct research, they model inquiry-based learning, demonstrating how to address complex problems and ask insightful questions. Students benefit tremendously from being exposed to the processes of scientific exploration and problem-solving, which encourages them to pursue their own research interests and develop their intellectual capabilities.Moreover, research activities often lead to opportunities for collaboration, funding, and professional development, ultimately benefiting the academic institution as a whole. Universities that prioritize research typically enhance their reputations and attract better resources, which can indirectly improve the educational experience for students.In conclusion, while teaching remains a fundamental aspect of a professor's role, dedicating more time to research enriches the educational environment and fosters a culture of inquiry. By focusing on research, professors not only advance their fields but also inspire and equip students to become lifelong learners and contributors to society. This balance between teaching and research is essential for the growth and dynamism of higher education.
236;How do television or movies influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to explain your answer.;There is no doubt that television or movies influence people’s behavior and they influence us in both bad ways and good ways. But I think in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways. They make people to eat more rubbish food, spend less time with their friends and family, and be someone that are not themselves. There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television. Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas. It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people’s health. Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods. In turn, people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases.Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends, especially children. They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies. When people are watching television or movies together, they also talk less to each other, compare to when playing social games, such as parlor games, together.Television and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements. These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images. When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements, they think that they are ugly. Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body. When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him, then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don’t prefer it.I think television and movies are entertaining but most of the time they influence people’s behavior in bad ways. If you want to stay healthy, be yourself and spend time with your family and friends, then you should spend less time watching these media.;The impact of television and movies on people's behavior has been a topic of ongoing debate. It is undeniable that these forms of media wield considerable influence over individuals, shaping their attitudes, values, and habits. However, the general consensus is that the effects of television and movies skew negative more often than positive. This pervasive influence can lead to unhealthy lifestyle choices, diminished social interactions, and a distortion of personal identity.One glaring example of this negative impact is the promotion of unhealthy eating habits. Television commercials and movie scenes often glorify junk food, portraying it as a source of pleasure and satisfaction. Viewers, particularly impressionable children and adolescents, may find themselves gravitating towards sugary snacks, fast food, and high-calorie meals. As a result, this tendency towards unhealthy eating can contribute to rising obesity rates and other diet-related health issues, ultimately compromising individuals’ well-being.In addition to dietary concerns, television and movies frequently shape social behavior by encouraging individuals to spend less time with their friends and family. With the lure of binge-watching popular shows or immersing oneself in cinematic worlds, individuals may prioritize screen time over personal relationships. This choice not only isolates them from genuine human connections but can also lead to feelings of loneliness and dissatisfaction in their lives. As face-to-face interactions dwindle, the fabric of familial and social bonds weakens, creating an environment where people feel disconnected from their communities.Moreover, individuals often find themselves striving to emulate idealized characters portrayed in films and television series. This quest for a self that aligns with these portrayals can lead to a loss of authenticity. Many people adopt behaviors and lifestyles far removed from their own personalities, leading to confusion and insecurity about their identity. Instead of fostering self-acceptance and individuality, the media often compels individuals to conform to unrealistic standards.In conclusion, while television and movies can serve as valuable sources of entertainment and cultural reflection, they predominantly exert a detrimental influence on individuals’ behavior, encouraging unhealthy eating, diminishing interpersonal relationships, and prompting an inauthentic self-presentation. Recognizing these negative influences is crucial for fostering healthier habits, nurturing genuine connections, and promoting self-acceptance in a world overly saturated with curated digital representations.
237;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people like to visit museums when they travel to new places, other people don't like to visit museums. I personaly tend to visit museums when I'm in a new place because it's good for me know about the culture, tradition and history of other places.The first reason why people are willing to visit museums when they travel to a new territory is that museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place, as I said back. And also taking the chance for making friends. Visit museums can bring you the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge to participate in conversations. And that kind of knowledge speaks very highly of you.However, other people visit museums are the most boring expirience of a trip. My cousin Pedro literaly hates to visit museums but he really enjoyed his visit to the famous London - Madame Tussaud museum, it was kind of art entertainment but also that visit helped him to understand the artist works, and in addition he started to respect and admire other types of arts that offers in other museums.In coclusion, the museums are a visual source to know the history, tradition and culture of any place in the world. I think it's fun and educational.;"Museums serve as valuable repositories of history and culture, offering insights into the diverse narratives that shape our understanding of the world. These institutions are not just collections of artifacts; they also illuminate the cultural evolution of a place through exhibitions, programs, and educational resources. Each artifact in a museum tells a story, providing a tangible connection to the past and fostering an appreciation for the art, customs, and traditions that define a community. By exploring these exhibits, visitors can gain a multifaceted perspective on historical events, societal changes, and artistic movements that might otherwise remain obscure.In addition to enhancing our understanding of history and culture, museums also serve as social spaces where individuals can forge meaningful connections. Visiting a museum is often a communal experience, where visitors encounter others who share an interest in art, history, or science. This shared curiosity creates a natural environment for conversation, allowing individuals to exchange ideas, insights, and interpretations of the exhibits. For those who are shy or new to a place, these settings can provide invaluable opportunities for social interaction, fostering friendships that might extend beyond the visit itself.Participating in museum programs, such as workshops, lectures, or guided tours, further enhances this potential for social engagement. These activities not only deepen one’s knowledge but also create platforms for dialogue, encouraging participants to share their perspectives on the topics presented. As visitors connect over their shared interests, they can build relationships grounded in mutual learning and exploration.In conclusion, museums play a pivotal role in enriching our comprehension of history and culture while simultaneously serving as venues for social interaction. Whether seeking to expand one’s knowledge or make new friends, visits to museums can lead to rewarding experiences, making them essential spaces in our communities."
238;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: In a busy and crowded world, we should not expect people to be polite to others.;Once a celebrity said: A man's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues. Recently, the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners. They are being rude towards others. Due to this phenomenon, someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other. Obviously, I do not agree with such kind of altitudes, the explanations I explored would be stated as following.First of all, a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression. Through those impressions, a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible. For example, I worked in a new company, if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well, my new colleagues will accept me, even then I will be approved by the employers. In opposite situation if I am being rude, I can not get along well with each other. Finally, I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job.Secondly, people will get respect from politeness within each other. Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need. A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure. There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed, because from their behaviors, they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity.Finally, the society needs a civilized environment and orders. And a degree of social civilization depend on its people's qualities. In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings, our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners. Benefit from those effective measures, there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate.All in all, I suppose that people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world.;"A man's manner is often described as a mirror that reflects his virtues, and this assertion holds profound significance in interpersonal relationships. The way an individual presents himself through etiquette, body language, and speech often reveals his core values and principles. A person who embodies good manners not only contributes positively to social interactions but also leaves an indelible impression on those around him. Manners extend beyond mere politeness; they encapsulate the essence of respect, kindness, and consideration for others.Politeness plays a pivotal role in shaping public perception. When a person interacts with others using courteous language and respectful gestures, they create an atmosphere that fosters goodwill and understanding. This not only enhances the speaker's reputation, making them more likable and trustworthy, but also uplifts those who are being addressed. Tender words and thoughtful actions can serve as a balm for individuals facing challenges, providing encouragement and demonstrating that they are valued and heard.The ripple effect of good manners is undeniable. A simple act of kindness or a polite remark can alleviate stress, instill hope, and inspire confidence in others. Someone in distress may find solace in a kind word or encouragement from a well-mannered individual, reinforcing the idea that human connections are vital to emotional well-being.In conclusion, a man's manner indeed serves as a mirror reflecting his virtues. Good manners not only enhance personal reputations but also cultivate compassionate environments where individuals feel respected and motivated. In a world often marked by haste and insensitivity, cultivating politeness and kindness can bridge divides and foster a community grounded in mutual respect and understanding. Thus, by embracing good manners, we not only uplift ourselves but also empower those around us, creating a more harmonious society."
239;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;There is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success. For that reason, some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives. However, some people think it isn't supposed to be that case. From my point of view, I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path.To start with, hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as, a shining weather, a delicious breakfast and etc. People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end. As a result, experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time.What's more, people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles. Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties, they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens. Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way.So, to sum it up, both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people's life path will be a priceless treasure to them. Remember if you are afraid of encountering difficulties, then you will be in the troubles all the time.;In life, challenges and hardships are often perceived as obstacles that impede progress and happiness. However, many believe that these difficulties encountered during early ages can serve as invaluable assets in one’s future. I wholeheartedly support the perspective that hardships faced in youth are not only beneficial but essential for personal growth and resilience.To begin with, experiencing difficulties teaches individuals to appreciate the simple, yet beautiful aspects of life. When faced with adversities, people learn to cherish the moments of joy and tranquility that might otherwise be taken for granted. For instance, a child who has faced financial struggles may come to value the warmth of family gatherings or the comfort of a home-cooked meal far more than someone who has never experienced such challenges. This realization fosters gratitude, leading to a more fulfilled and contented life.Moreover, individuals who have navigated through challenging circumstances often develop a calm demeanor when confronted with new troubles. Having already faced and overcome obstacles, they possess a confidence that comes from knowing they can endure difficult situations. Such individuals are likely to be more resilient and resourceful, drawing on their past experiences to strategize and tackle current issues. This calmness can also positively influence those around them, as they serve as pillars of support for others in distress.In conclusion, the difficulties faced in early life stages are not mere burdens but formidable teachers. They instill a deep appreciation for the small joys of life and empower individuals with the resilience needed to navigate future challenges. Embracing these experiences allows people to cultivate strength, ultimately contributing to their personal and emotional development. Thus, difficulties can indeed become invaluable fortunes on the path to a fulfilling life.
240;Life in a city is much better than life in the countryside;As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement that life in a city is much better than life in the countryside.Firstly, in the city there is much better education system. This means, that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places.In addition, I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside. There are not only more jobs, but they are also well-paid. Of course living in a city is more expensive, but incomes are higher too.Moreover, in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means, that the culture diversity is huge. Meeting and knowing new people's tradition is an unforgettable experience, which could influence on one's previous habits.Furthermore, the city has well-organised lines of transport. The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside, so the city provides better communication.However, in the countryside there are many places to rest, because of its location. Moreover, peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness.Taking all into account, I think that living in the city is much better nowadays, because of the opportunities it gives. Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle, which for me is without perspective. If I could decide I would chose living in the city for sure.;The comparison between urban and rural living has been a subject of discussion for many years, particularly concerning education, employment opportunities, cultural diversity, and overall quality of life. One of the most significant advantages of city life is its robust education system and plethora of work opportunities. Urban areas tend to host a higher concentration of schools, colleges, and universities that offer a variety of programs, contributing to better educational outcomes for students. The possibility of internships, mentorships, and employment in various industries further enhances the professional prospects available to graduates.Moreover, urban centers boast a rich cultural diversity, as they attract populations from different backgrounds, ethnicities, and lifestyles. This diversity not only enriches the local culture but also encourages social interaction among various communities, fostering a sense of inclusivity and global awareness. The vibrant city life is reflected in its festivals, culinary scenes, and social events, providing residents with a unique tapestry of experiences that can broaden their horizons.Another advantage of city life is the efficient public transportation system. Buses and trains operate with greater frequency and coverage, facilitating easier and more convenient communication within the city. This accessibility allows residents to navigate urban environments with relative ease, promoting mobility and reducing the reliance on personal vehicles.However, the countryside offers its distinct charm and benefits that can often outweigh those found in urban settings. The abundance of open spaces, greenery, and natural landscapes provides individuals with peaceful retreats, ideal for relaxation and rejuvenation. Rural areas offer a slower pace of life, allowing residents to connect deeply with nature and enjoy tranquility that is often lost in the hustle and bustle of the city.In conclusion, while urban environments thrive on educational opportunities, cultural diversity, and efficient transportation, rural areas present a cherished escape of natural beauty and serene living. Ultimately, the choice between the two depends on individual preferences and lifestyle aspirations.
241;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does.;With the development of the economy, people become more and more rich. They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness. While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people, I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us.Admittedly, job can bring us happiness. People can receive a sense of values and respected from job. If people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence. In addition, job can provide money to us. However, people should concern more about their living environment than job. First, for most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives. Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years. For example, Workers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day. These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work. Second, beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people. Without beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety. Nowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly. Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil. In order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests. In China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people. Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories, they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases.In conclusion, it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers.;As individuals accumulate wealth and experience the comforts of financial stability, they often begin to shift their focus toward their mental well-being and happiness. While it is true that a fulfilling job can provide a significant source of happiness for some, I firmly believe that the living environment plays a more critical role in determining overall contentment for most people.A high-paying job can offer numerous benefits, including social status, self-esteem, and a sense of achievement. For some, the intrinsic rewards of a challenging career can lead to increased satisfaction and fulfillment. However, this scenario does not universally apply to everyone. Many individuals may find that their jobs, despite being well-compensated, can also be sources of stress, burnout, and dissatisfaction. In contrast, a positive living environment can serve as a continuous source of support and stability, which is essential for mental well-being.The living environment encompasses various factors, including community, family connections, social networks, and access to recreational areas. A nurturing environment fosters meaningful relationships and provides emotional support, which are fundamental components of happiness. Moreover, living in a place that offers natural beauty, safety, and a sense of belonging can significantly enhance one's mood and outlook on life. Additionally, the benefits of a supportive living environment can have lasting effects on mental health. Quality interactions with neighbors and a sense of community can buffer against stress and anxiety, creating a sense of contentment that often outweighs the ephemeral joys derived from a high-paying job. In conclusion, while a rewarding job can contribute to happiness, the importance of a positive living environment cannot be overstated. For many individuals, a supportive and nurturing home and community play a fundamental role in fostering long-term mental well-being and happiness. As society becomes wealthier, it is essential to prioritize and invest in the quality of our living environments to enhance overall happiness and life satisfaction.
242;Some people like to communicate by e-mail and voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer?;Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day. Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much. Voice mail, e-mail, telephone or just traditional way: face-to-face. However, I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating.Everyone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication. You can talk to others from thousands mile. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact. We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address. If the address is wrong, then you will know right away. Moreover, e-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click.In addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly. Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid. Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect. For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do. Therefore, e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out. She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed. I don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive.Last but not least, every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time. Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident. For example, when I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively. They may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say. Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation. E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive. On the whole, to compare to all ways of communication, I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use. Its convenience saves our time. Additionally, honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can't be missing for a persuasive expression.;"In today's fast-paced world, communication largely depends on technology. With the advent of various digital tools, such as voicemail, email, and telephones, alongside traditional methods like face-to-face interaction, people can now connect more efficiently than ever before. However, among these options, I find email to be the most effective means of communication for three compelling reasons: convenience, honest expression, and fluency in conveying thoughts.First and foremost, the convenience of email makes it a preferred choice for many. Unlike a phone call or an in-person discussion, emails can be sent and received at any time of day, allowing for greater flexibility in managing communication. This asynchronous nature allows individuals to organize their thoughts without the pressure of an immediate response, enabling them to communicate when it suits them best. Furthermore, emails do not require the involvement of both parties simultaneously, making multitasking easier.Secondly, emails provide an excellent platform for honest expression. When crafting an email, individuals have the opportunity to carefully consider their words and emotions before hitting ""send."" This is particularly beneficial in sensitive situations where an immediate response could lead to miscommunication or misunderstanding. Emails allow for truthful and thoughtful expression without the influence of spontaneous reactions that might occur during live conversations.Lastly, email contributes to fluency in communication. Writing in a structured format allows me to articulate my ideas in a coherent manner. I can organize my thoughts logically and ensure that my message is clear. This is particularly important in complex or nuanced discussions where clarity is paramount. Additionally, email allows for drafting and editing, which further enhances the quality of the communication.In conclusion, while various forms of communication are available in today's technology-driven society, I prefer email. Its convenience, potential for honest expression, and facilitation of fluency in communication make it an invaluable tool for effective interaction in a globalized world."
243;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"There are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost. Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium, it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences. However, from my point of view, television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other.To begin with, television shows make people forget what is really important. One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air. Thus, they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives. One of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show ""Infinete Challenges"". This is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other. That is, watching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us.Moreover, even when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television. Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone. Thus, it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness. To illustrate my point, it is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together. It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don't require any participation.In conclusion, I firmly believe that it is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward. It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close.";Television has long been a staple of modern entertainment, weaving its way into the fabric of daily life. However, an argument can be made that the societal implications of television are more detrimental than beneficial, particularly in its effect on human interaction and prioritization of values. One of the most pressing issues is how television contributes to a decline in meaningful conversations among individuals.As television shows encompass audiences with engaging narratives and characters, people often find themselves more captivated by what is happening on-screen than by the people sitting next to them. Family dinners, once a time for sharing stories and experiences, are now frequently interrupted by the glow of a television screen. Viewers become passive consumers of entertainment rather than active participants in their own lives. This shift has resulted in a significant loss of connection, as people prioritize fictional characters over real-life relationships, compromising personal interactions and emotional bonds.Furthermore, the allure of favorite programs can lead to an unhealthy obsession. When individuals become overly invested in their preferred shows, they risk neglecting their responsibilities and relationships. It becomes common for viewers to schedule their lives around television air times, further isolating themselves from the people around them. This obsession can detract from engaging in hobbies, nurturing friendships, or even participating in simple, yet fulfilling conversations. The stories portrayed may mask the essence of reality, leading individuals to forget what is truly important in their lives.In conclusion, while television can offer moments of entertainment and inspiration, the adverse effects it has on human connection and focus on essential aspects of life cannot be overlooked. By fostering inactive lifestyles and diminishing genuine communication, television places a greater emphasis on screen time over real-time interactions, ultimately leading to a society that may be more engrossed in fiction than in tangible relationships.
244;Some people like to communicate by e-mail or voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer and why?;Although many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face, personally I believe that communicating by e-mails or voice mails is better. There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay.Firstly, communicating by e-mail is easy. Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with. In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident.Secondly, you can write an e-mail at any time of the day. As for me, I work and study at the university and I don't have spare time during the day. I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems. I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail.Thirdly, when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself. For example, you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite. When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail.And finally, there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail. You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business.To sum up, I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible, but if this is an important and not urgent question I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail.;communication is essential, but the method of communication greatly influences its effectiveness and convenience. While many individuals favor traditional methods such as telephone calls or face-to-face conversations, I firmly believe that communicating via emails or voicemails offers distinct advantages. There are several reasons supporting this perspective, which I would like to elaborate on.Firstly, the convenience factor is significant. Many people experience anxiety when it comes to making a phone call, especially to someone they are not familiar with. The pressure to respond immediately in real-time conversations can be overwhelming, leading to miscommunication or missed points. Conversely, leaving a voicemail allows individuals to express their thoughts clearly without the fear of instant judgment. Similarly, emails provide an opportunity to construct well-thought-out messages at one’s own pace, ensuring clarity and comprehension.Secondly, the flexibility associated with email communication is unparalleled. Unlike phone calls that require both parties to be available simultaneously, emails can be sent and received at any time of the day. This flexibility is invaluable for people with busy schedules or those in different time zones. Personally, I appreciate being able to send an email whenever inspiration strikes or a thought emerges, rather than being confined to the limited hours of phone availability. This allows for reflection and ensures that the sender’s message is properly articulated before it is transmitted.Furthermore, written communication leaves a record for future reference. Emails and voicemails can be revisited, making it easier to track conversations, agreements, or shared information. This aspect is particularly beneficial in professional environments, where clarity and documentation are crucial.In conclusion, while telephone and face-to-face communication have their merits, I advocate for the superiority of emails and voicemails. Their ease of use, flexibility, and permanence make them more efficient in today’s fast-paced world. Embracing these methods can enhance our communication experiences significantly.
245;"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement ""haste makes waste"" use specific reasons and examples.";This saying is stating that every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one. In my opinion, this statement is completely true, for these few reasons:For one thing, making a quick decision means that it's not very thought out, and that it hasn't been checked from all its aspects. Consequently, making quick decisions leads to probable bad results. For example: if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative, or a plan B, he could end up being unemployed, because of his speedy decision.In addition, making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity. In another word, if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn't have missed out on the job opening in the same firm, but at a different position. Hence, he wouldn't have been unemployed.Not to mention, that hasty decisions, not only goes to waste, but also, could affect the entire life of the person. To put it differently, is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed, he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs, thus, his life had taken a turn to the worst.As can be seen from this, is that a hurried decision is almost never a good one. That's why one should always study his decision carefully and slowly, to ensure that the decision that the person is making is the best for him.;"In the fast-paced world we live in today, the urgency to make swift decisions often overshadows the necessity for careful consideration. The reality is that every hasty and poorly thought-out decision is essentially a wasted one. Quick judgments, while seemingly efficient, frequently lead to regrettable outcomes that may alter the course of an individual’s life. The consequences of hurried choices extend beyond mere dissatisfaction; they can result in irreversible changes that impact personal relationships, career paths, and overall well-being.The allure of rapid decision-making stems from a desire to seize immediate opportunities or avoid prolonged indecision. However, such impulsivity can cloud judgment, leading to choices made without fully weighing the pros and cons. For instance, a rushed career change may promise excitement but could push someone into an unsatisfactory job, wasting both time and potential. Similarly, decisions about relationships made in the heat of the moment can lead to heartache and broken ties that might have been avoided with clearer reflection.Moreover, the implications of these fast decisions often ripple outward, affecting not only the individual but also those around them. A quick decision made in a professional setting might compromise teamwork or ethics, leading to a toxic atmosphere and diminished productivity. On a personal level, impulsive choices can strain family bonds and friendships, as trust and understanding take a backseat to momentary impulses.In conclusion, while quick decisions may seem advantageous, they are rarely well-founded. The ramifications of such actions can be profound and lasting, reinforcing the importance of thoughtful deliberation before making choices. Ultimately, taking the time to evaluate options leads to more meaningful decisions that contribute positively to one’s life and the lives of others."
246;Some people think that the automobile has improved modern life. Others think that the automobile has caused serious problems. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life. Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are. Generally speaking, I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life, for several reasons.Firstly, people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages. For example in relationships. Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle. From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city. I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away. Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today. Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship.In addition, cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home. Furthermore, they are more flexible. My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money. He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend. If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms.Finally, the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world. If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life. They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas. There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car. As a result, people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world.In conclusion, the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life. Travelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car.;The automobile stands as one of the most significant advancements in the realm of transportation, profoundly impacting the way we live, work, and interact with the world around us. In contemporary society, many individuals own cars, and this widespread ownership emphasizes the importance of automobiles in everyday life. The convenience and accessibility they provide are unparalleled, enabling people to navigate vast distances with ease, which fundamentally enhances their mobility.One of the primary benefits of automobiles is the freedom they afford individuals. Unlike public transportation, which often operates on strict schedules and limited routes, cars enable users to travel at their own pace, exploring new places whenever they desire. This increased flexibility allows for spontaneous road trips, daily commutes, and quick errands. Moreover, cars can facilitate access to remote areas that public transport might overlook, opening up a plethora of opportunities for adventure and exploration. As a result, the automobile encourages individuals to travel more frequently, fostering a deeper understanding of diverse cultures and landscapes.Additionally, the automobile plays a crucial role in the economy by connecting people to job opportunities and essential services. It serves as a vital link between urban and rural areas, ensuring that everyone has access to resources like healthcare, education, and employment. Without the automobile, many individuals would face significant barriers to accessing these necessities, underscoring its importance not only as a mode of transport but as a lifeline for many communities.In conclusion, the automobile is an indispensable part of modern life that enables enhanced mobility, fosters exploration, and connects individuals to vital resources. As we continue to rely on automobiles, their impact on our daily lives and the intricate tapestry of human experience only promises to grow. The automobile indeed revolutionizes the way we traverse the world, making it a significant aspect of society today.
247;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: It is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents job than to choose jobs that are very different from their parents jobs.;When choosing a job, one need to consider it thoroughly. Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents' job or not, different people may hold different opinions. As far as I am concerned, I think choosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career. First of all, as parents are involved in the same environment, they could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information. For example, my father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge. Whenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting. Because he has many experiences, I could save enormous time in finding solution. This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues. If I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now.Nevertheless, since parents have worked in tens of years, they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry. They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children. For instance, they know which company has better welfare or provides better education. Moreover, their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies. It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society. When others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process. Some may argue that as time is different, the condition of job market is completely different. Therefore, choosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision. I agree with this opinion to some extent, but when it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly. The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash, so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more.In considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents', I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry. I believe parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path.;Choosing a career path that mirrors the professions of one's parents can offer significant advantages, primarily due to the extensive support and resources parents can provide. When children pursue careers similar to their parents, they benefit from the wealth of domain knowledge, industry-related information, and professional networks their parents have cultivated over the years. This familial connection often translates into a smoother transition into the workforce, as parents can offer mentorship, guidance, and insights that might otherwise be inaccessible to their children.Parents are often immersed in their professional environments, which allows them to relay essential information about industry trends, job expectations, and necessary skills. As children contemplate their career options, the firsthand experiences shared by their parents can clarify their understanding of various roles and the education required to succeed in them. For instance, a child of a doctor may gain a clearer perspective on the demands of the medical field through the stories and advice imparted by their parent, which can shape their academic and career choices from a young age.Critics argue that the job market is constantly evolving, and that conditions differ vastly from those that existed during parents’ careers. While it is true that technological advancements and shifting economic landscapes can alter job prospects, foundational skills and values such as work ethic, adaptability, and professionalism remain relevant across generations. Rather than hindering a child’s career exploration, parental guidance can help them navigate the complexities of a changing job market.In conclusion, while the job landscape may differ with time, the support, experience, and insights that parents can provide remain invaluable. Aligning career choices with parental professions can foster smoother trajectories and equip children with the tools they need to thrive in an ever-evolving world.
249;Should we pay professional athletes (entertainers) a high salary? (Do professional athletes deserve their high salary?)Ê;Professional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine. Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this. This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question-do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money? From my prospect, I believe that they do deserve this high payment.First of all, a worker's salary can properly reflect his/her competence and value on his/her career. Therefore, those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways. They are not paid for no reason. As we are now live in a competent world, we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment. It's all the same in every profession. That's why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields, namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods.Second, such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete's great performances. Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they've gone through and how much cost they've thrown into investing themselves. They shall reap within their high salaries. In other words, if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances, there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed. Some people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair. However, in my opinion, as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his/her dreams and careers, that would be fair. Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone, but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment.In conclusion, high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances. It is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment, giving us awesome performances to enjoy.;"The vast earnings of professional athletes and entertainers often spark debate regarding fairness in income distribution. While it is true that these individuals earn amounts that can be hard for the average person to comprehend, the question arises: Do they deserve such high salaries? From my perspective, yes, they do. Their extraordinary compensation is not only reflective of their rare skills and hard work but also essential for maintaining the high level of performance expected in their fields.Firstly, a worker's salary can serve as a direct reflection of their competence and the unique value they bring to their profession. Athletes and entertainers possess skills that are honed over years, often starting from a young age. This level of dedication, talent, and resilience is not commonplace; it requires immense sacrifices, including time, physical demands, and mental fortitude. The competition in professional sports and entertainment is fierce, with only a few reaching the pinnacle of success. Their high salaries are a reward for their exceptional abilities and the entertainment they provide, which captivates millions and brings joy to their fans.Secondly, the substantial income that these professionals earn plays a vital role in supporting their performances. High salaries allow athletes to invest in top-notch training facilities, nutrition, recovery, and coaching. These elements are crucial for maintaining peak performance and prolonging their careers. Additionally, many athletes use their platform for philanthropy, giving back to communities and causes, which further emphasizes the positive impact of their earning potential.In conclusion, while the income gap between athletes and ordinary workers may seem unjust, it is essential to consider the unique talents, dedication, and societal contributions these individuals make. Their high payments reflect their competence and support the performances that engage and inspire many around the world."
251;Should we require our young children (aged 5-10) to learn music and art in addition to math, science, history and language?;Every parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful. In order to achieve this, they start cultivating their children when they are very young. In addition to basic knowledge like language or science, music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents. In my opinion, I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them. First, it's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young. Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination. Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules. They are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched. Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances. Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination.Second, music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing. They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way. They are essential to our spiritual life. Therefore, even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure.However, some people might argue that parents shouldn't put so much stress on children, since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them. In my opinion, it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like. If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much. In a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills. In this way, it will not be such pressure on children. In conclusion, young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage. Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his/her life.;"Music and art have long been integral components of childhood education, frequently featured on the must-learn lists compiled by enthusiastic parents. In my opinion, these creative disciplines serve as more than mere extracurricular activities; they are vital avenues through which children can develop their senses and emotional intelligence from a young age. Engaging in music and art cultivates a child's ability to perceive their surroundings, enhancing sensory experiences that are crucial during formative years. For instance, learning to play an instrument or to paint can sharpen auditory and visual skills, respectively. These activities encourage children to observe nuances in sound, color, and form, providing a foundation for greater sensitivity to the world around them. Moreover, these creative pursuits foster critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as children navigate the challenges of creating and expressing their ideas through various mediums.Furthermore, the benefits of music and art extend far beyond childhood. They are life-long cultivations worthy of investment, opening doors to numerous opportunities in personal and professional realms. Studies have suggested that individuals who engage with the arts tend to have higher levels of creativity and adaptability, characteristics that are invaluable in an ever-evolving job market. Additionally, these disciplines provide a healthy outlet for self-expression, helping individuals navigate the complexities of emotions throughout their lives.Lastly, participation in music and art can nourish one’s temperament, instilling qualities like patience, discipline, and resilience. The process of honing a skill requires dedication and perseverance, traits that not only contribute to artistic growth but can also positively influence other areas of life. In conclusion, prioritizing music and art education for children is an investment that reaps rewards far beyond the classroom, nurturing well-rounded individuals capable of contributing richly to society."
252;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is explaining how that subject will help in their lives outside school.;There are many ways of teaching. Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching, while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing. In my opinion, I agree with the second idea that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school.First of all, by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject. Take chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class. While I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas. This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good. I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore.Second, by bridging the theories with daily life events, students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving. This will address students' interests because it's the assignment that needs real life participation. For example, in law class, students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them. When any one of the situations occurs, they can think independently and figure out how to react.In conclusion, using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students' attention and keep them eager on learning, not only because it reinforces students' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own.;In my opinion, one of the most effective strategies teachers can use to engage students in a subject is to demonstrate its relevance to their lives outside of the classroom. When educators connect course content to real-world applications, students are more likely to see the value of what they are learning, which can spark their interest and motivation. This approach fosters a deeper understanding of the subject, making it more relatable and less abstract.For example, consider mathematics, often viewed as a dry and difficult subject. When teachers illustrate the importance of math in everyday scenarios—such as budgeting for groceries, measuring ingredients for a recipe, or analyzing sports statistics—students can appreciate its practical implications. By seeing math as a tool that they can use in their own lives, students develop a vivid impression of the subject, transforming their attitude from indifference to curiosity.Similarly, subjects like history can take on new life when educators draw connections between historical events and contemporary societal issues. Understanding the impact of past events on present-day politics, culture, and social movements can inspire students to engage more fully with the material. This approach encourages students to think critically about their own lives and the world around them.Furthermore, when teachers actively involve students in discussions about how specific subjects apply to their passions or future career aspirations, it can empower them to take ownership of their learning. This connection not only heightens their interest but also fosters a sense of relevance and urgency in acquiring knowledge.In conclusion, by framing academic subjects within the context of everyday life and personal aspirations, teachers can cultivate a more engaging and dynamic learning environment. In doing so, students are more likely to become enthusiastic learners, thereby paving the way for lifelong education and a deeper appreciation of the subjects they study.
253;Governments should focus its budget more on environmental protection than on economic developments.;Environmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century. They are both important because they are vital to human's future and welfare. However, since the budget and the recourse are limited, governments must choose between these two issues. In my opinion, I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments. The following are reasons why. First, environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments. All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one. Without Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she's gone. Just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well. Second, the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues. Environmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems. Take global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together. The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator, since the rising sea water could drown them. Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth.Some people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside. They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away. However, the truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now. It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages.In conclusion, environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence. As mentioned in the second paragraph, how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy? Similarly, how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by, ironically, by ourselves?;"In the 21st century, the dual challenges of environmental protection and economic development stand as pivotal issues that will shape the future of humanity. As our global population grows, so too does the demand for natural resources and economic stability. Both issues are intertwined; economic development often drives environmental degradation, while environmental sustainability can foster new economic opportunities. Nevertheless, in my opinion, prioritizing environmental protection is crucial for ensuring the welfare of future generations.The degradation of our planet's ecosystems poses an existential threat that transcends economic considerations. Climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution are not just environmental concerns; they are immediate crises affecting food security, health, and livelihoods worldwide. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), failing to address these challenges could lead to catastrophic outcomes, including extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and the disruption of vital natural resources. These threats undermine economic development by destabilizing communities and increasing vulnerability, particularly in poorer regions.Moreover, a healthy environment is the foundation on which sustainable economics must be built. The natural world provides essential services—clean air, water, and fertile land—that are prerequisites for any economic activity. Investing in renewable energy, sustainable agricultural practices, and conservation not only safeguards these resources but also stimulates economic growth by fostering innovation and creating jobs. Therefore, while economic development is important, it should not come at the expense of the environment. The pursuit of economic goals must be aligned with ecological sustainability. Addressing environmental issues should be viewed as a priority, as they hold the key to our survival and the prosperity of future generations. Ultimately, a balanced approach that emphasizes environmental protection will yield long-term benefits for both people and the planet. In this rapidly evolving century, the time for transformative change is now."
254;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not. Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen, the car use will decrease. While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. But as far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea, which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future. The following reasons will present my points.First of all, since the public transportation has improved, it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus. For example, I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars. So, with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own. Second, a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world. So, with the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not. For example, instead of driving each one's car, if we put forty people in a bus, it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city.Although, I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can't meet every place. Of course, it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places. However, no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet. It not only helps you to reduce the car use, but also good to your health. In this way, this won't be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared, the best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years.;"The rise in environmental concerns has prompted many discussions about the future of car usage. While some individuals argue that personal vehicles are indispensable for daily life, I firmly believe that we will witness a decrease in car usage in the years to come. This shift is primarily driven by growing awareness of environmental issues, advancements in public transportation, and the emergence of sustainable alternatives.The increasing urgency surrounding climate change has made people more conscious of their carbon footprint. As the detrimental effects of pollution become more evident, society is more inclined to seek eco-friendly transportation options. Governments worldwide are taking decisive action to reduce emissions; cities are enhancing their infrastructure to promote cycling, walking, and the use of public transit. This places pressure on car-centric lifestyles and encourages individuals to adopt greener modes of transportation.Moreover, technologically advanced public transportation systems are becoming more affordable, efficient, and user-friendly. With the development of smart city initiatives, cities are integrating real-time tracking, mobile payments, and increased service frequency into public transport. These improvements significantly augment the appeal of using buses and trains over personal vehicles. For instance, ride-sharing services and electric scooters are becoming popular options that cater to the need for efficient and sustainable travel.In addition, innovations such as car-sharing and subscription-based vehicle services present viable solutions for those who occasionally require a car without the financial burden of ownership. As more people recognize these available options, the traditional notion that a personal vehicle is essential for day-to-day life will increasingly be challenged.In conclusion, while personal cars currently play a significant role in individuals' daily routines, the confluence of environmental awareness, improved public transport, and innovative alternatives strongly suggests that car usage will decline in the future. Embracing sustainable practices not only benefits the planet but also encourages a more connected and healthier society."
255;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? ItÕs not necessary for university students to attend class as long as they can pass their examinations.;In university education, students are given much independence in the ways of learning. Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses, while some students don't feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams. These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations. In my opinion, I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is. First, in terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams. Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students. Professors not only have the knowledge, but also equip with experiences, knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements. Second, it's students' basic responsibility to attend class. Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves. Many professors grade their students with class attendances. In other words, class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances. Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn't show up in the classes.Some people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own. Why wasting time going to classes? Doesn't self-study more efficient? However, in my opinion, this is a rather immodest way of thinking. I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors. Besides, even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors, they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates. In conclusion, students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes. It's an essential learning process. Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning. The learning process itself, however, is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student.;In the realm of university education, students are often afforded a significant degree of independence in their learning methods. This autonomy allows them to tailor their educational experiences according to their personal needs, preferences, and schedules. However, this freedom comes with its own set of challenges, particularly in the context of class attendance. A portion of the student body may choose to skip lectures, believing that if they can adequately prepare for exams through self-study, attending class is unnecessary. While some may achieve short-term success in this approach, it is important to recognize that attending class serves as a vital component of a well-rounded education.Attending classes provides students with numerous benefits that self-study alone cannot replicate. Classroom environments facilitate direct interaction with professors and peers, promoting a richer understanding of the material. Lectures often include discussions, group activities, and immediate feedback that enhance comprehension and retention. Moreover, professors may share insights, contextual information, or real-world applications that are not readily available in textbooks or online resources. These elements combined create an engaging learning atmosphere that fosters critical thinking and collaboration, skills essential for future careers.Furthermore, it is crucial to acknowledge that attending class is a fundamental responsibility for students. University is not solely about acquiring knowledge but also about developing habits, discipline, and accountability. By making the conscious choice to participate in lectures, students show respect not only for their education but also for their instructors and classmates. This commitment lays the groundwork for professional conduct in the future, shaping students into responsible individuals who understand the importance of engagement in any collaborative effort.In conclusion, while independence in learning is a hallmark of university education, attending classes significantly enhances the learning experience. It is the students' fundamental responsibility to actively participate in their educational journeys, ensuring not only personal success but also contributing to a dynamic academic community.
256;"When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success."" Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above?";What do you think when you see a beautiful building? And also when you see an airport? Do you think they have built by chance? Of course don't. Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google, Yahoo etc. created by chance. Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success, but to be frank I cannot agree with them. I would explore my primary reasons here. To begin with, famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people. Hard work make you a professional man/woman which are powerful in his or her job. I mean, when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success. For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal. Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty. But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me. It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me. Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me. He do a lot of exercise in football field every day, so it is not for which he is luckier than me.Moreover, we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful. I don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us. So, for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question. You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky. If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam. Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam.Finally, you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way. The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance. These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his/her work. Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works.In the end, I think any great success need great work not great luck, even though luck is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans.;"Title: The Role of Diligence Over Luck in Achieving SuccessIn any discussion surrounding success, the concept of luck often emerges as a significant factor. However, I firmly believe that attributing success primarily to luck undermines the hard work and dedication that countless individuals invest in their pursuits. While a stroke of good fortune might provide temporary advantages, it is the relentless effort and perseverance of individuals that truly pave the way to lasting success.To begin with, the paths of famous personalities often illustrate that diligence plays a more pivotal role than mere luck. Take, for instance, well-known figures such as Thomas Edison or J.K. Rowling. Edison famously stated that ""genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration,"" emphasizing the importance of hard work in achieving innovative breakthroughs. Rowling faced numerous rejections before her Harry Potter series became a global phenomenon, showcasing how persistence and resilience can yield extraordinary results. These examples highlight that behind every successful individual lies an unwavering commitment to their goals rather than mere happenstance.Moreover, relying on luck as a foundation for success is impractical and often misleading. Luck is inherently unpredictable; it can favor individuals on one occasion and abandon them the next. By depending solely on luck, one risks stagnation, as this belief can lead to complacency. True success is built on consistent effort, learning from failures, and adapting to challenges. It involves cultivating skills, building networks, and seizing opportunities that arise through dedicated work, rather than waiting passively for serendipitous moments.In conclusion, while luck may play a minor role in certain instances, it is diligence that serves as the true cornerstone of success. History teaches us that hard work, determination, and an unyielding pursuit of dreams are what ultimately lead to significant achievements. Therefore, striving for excellence through consistent effort is far more beneficial than merely hoping for luck to shine upon us."
257;Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than a teacher. Others think that it is better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.;Different people prefer different styles of learning. I think both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful. Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning. Another important point is that for practical subjects you have to have a teacher. On the other hand, sometimes I would rather learning on my own.A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier. Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available, I get discouraged after spending a lot of time. In this situation, I'll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her. And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won't get discouraged and confused.There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor. For example, if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming, you'll have to find a teacher. It's almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own. By the way, if you are going to learn some things by yourself, you may learn and understand them incorrectly! For example, from my own experiences, after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher, I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo, but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits, I was able to play properly.There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won't have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes. In today's world there are many great and useful sources available like books, electronic books, the internet and TV and satellite. I can utilize them as tutorials for many things. For instance, I can learn English or other languages by a lot of helpful books and many online websites. In sum, sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own. In my view, both can help and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages.;Learning is a multifaceted journey, and the method by which we engage with new information can significantly shape our understanding and retention. One of the most effective modes of learning is through a teacher, particularly an experienced one. A knowledgeable teacher can clarify complex concepts, provide structured learning pathways, and offer immediate feedback. This can prevent confusion that often arises when tackling challenging subjects independently. A teacher’s guided approach can lead to a more efficient learning process, increasing both the rate and speed at which a student acquires new knowledge.When a teacher presents material, they can highlight key points, present real-world applications, and encourage questions that stimulate critical thinking. Moreover, they can tailor their teaching style to suit individual learning preferences, whether auditory, visual, or kinesthetic. This personalized attention can significantly enhance comprehension and retention, making the learning experience smoother and more enjoyable.However, there are situations where self-directed learning proves beneficial. Independent study encourages personal responsibility and fosters critical thinking skills, as I often find myself exploring topics of interest at my own pace. This autonomy allows me to delve deeper into subjects that fascinate me and to pursue lines of inquiry that may not be covered in a conventional classroom setting. Moreover, the process of self-discovery can boost confidence and instill a deeper sense of mastery over the material.Ultimately, both methods have their unique advantages. While a competent teacher can simplify the learning process and provide essential support, self-directed learning can cultivate independence and foster a passion for knowledge. Striking a balance between the two approaches can lead to a more enriched and comprehensive educational experience, equipping students with the skills necessary to thrive in diverse learning environments.
258;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Working at home with a computer and a phone is better than working at a companyÕs office using the same equipment.;Due to the convenience of current technology, people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them. People are no longer restricted in the office. This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it's better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company's office. In my opinion, I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office.First of all, while working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly. They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together. Think about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he/she can assemble his/her colleges right away and discuss. It's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone. For another example, if one’s computer or Internet has any breakdown, he/she can call the MIS staff to fix.Second, working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works. For example, people are easily distracted while working at home. It's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away. In addition, while people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing. Moreover, people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss.In conclusion, working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency. It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home.;In today’s fast-paced world, technology has enabled individuals to perform their jobs from virtually anywhere, provided they have the right tools and equipment. The allure of working from home has gained traction over recent years, especially during the global pandemic. While remote work offers flexibility and comfort, I contend that working in an office setting is generally more effective and beneficial for both employees and organizations.One of the key disadvantages of remote work is the potential for disconnection from the workplace culture and critical events. In an office environment, employees are more likely to be informed of important announcements and developments directly from their supervisors and colleagues. These spontaneous interactions often serve as a catalyst for collaboration and innovation. When working from home, employees may miss essential briefings, updates, or informal discussions that are crucial for staying informed and engaged.Moreover, the absence of a structured work environment can hinder productivity. The office setting fosters a sense of discipline and a clear demarcation between work and personal life. At home, individuals may face distractions that disrupt concentration and productivity, such as household chores, family members, or the temptation to relax. This lack of a dedicated workspace often leads to a decline in work efficiency.Additionally, remote workers may experience feelings of isolation, which can adversely affect their mental well-being. The camaraderie built through face-to-face interactions fosters support and motivation, making it easier for employees to collaborate and problem-solve. In contrast, working from home can lead to a sense of disconnect, which may ultimately diminish job satisfaction.In conclusion, while the possibility of working from anywhere offers undeniable convenience, I believe that office work remains superior for effective communication, productivity, and employee well-being. Businesses should consider integrating hybrid models that allow for both flexibility and the invaluable benefits of in-person collaboration.
259;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In order to succeed, you should be more like others than be different from everyone else.;Achieving success is everybody's goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success. Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances, while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else. Which one is the promising way to succeed? In my opinion, I believe that once you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success.First, being positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others. As living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game. Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive. If you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you. Take myself for example, when I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently.Second, being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others. In other words, once you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you. Take the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example. The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors. It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers. It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value.In conclusion, being different and unique is the better way to achieve success. It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards success.;"In today’s world, being different from the crowd is often a hallmark of achievement and innovation. Embracing uniqueness allows individuals and companies to carve out their own niche, creating value that stands independently and cannot be easily replicated. The most popular and prestigious technology company, Apple Inc., exemplifies this principle through its distinctive product design, branding, and consumer engagement strategies. Apple has consistently differentiated itself from competitors by prioritizing aesthetics, user experience, and groundbreaking technology. From the initial launch of the Macintosh in 1984 to the revolutionary iPhone, each product embodies a unique blend of simplicity and sophistication that appeals to consumers worldwide. Apple’s commitment to innovative design and functionality has not only set its products apart but also established an enviable brand loyalty, which is a testament to the value of being different.Moreover, the uniqueness that Apple possesses creates intrinsic value that cannot be diluted or replicated by others. This is evidenced by the iconic status of the Apple logo, which transcends geographical and cultural boundaries. Consumers don’t merely purchase Apple products; they invest in a lifestyle that symbolizes creativity and excellence. The company's ability to foster a strong brand identity rooted in uniqueness has cultivated a community of discerning users who identify themselves with the brand’s core values.In conclusion, being different is not merely about standing out; it is about achieving superiority through innovation and creating an unparalleled value that others cannot replicate. Apple Inc. serves as a powerful illustration of how embracing uniqueness can lead to extraordinary success, reinforcing the notion that individual distinctions can pave the way to greatness in an increasingly competitive world. By championing originality, one can inspire others and leave an indelible mark on the landscape of innovation."
261;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The personal and work-related challenges that young people are facing are not different with their parents and grandparents faced when they were young.;While debating about generation issues, people always have different opinions. Some people believe that little things changed through generation, while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way. In my opinion, I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation.First, under globalization and industrial integration, the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging. The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world. In the past, focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage. However, as those industries expand and become internationalized, people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges. For example, now there are more chances to do business with people around the world, so besides one's own profession, language ability is essential as well. For another example, financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century, thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management. Second, this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation. The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them. In contrast, young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually. They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want. It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them. They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences. In conclusion, challenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation, whether in career or in self-identification. It is hard to judge which generation's problems are more difficult but it is no doubt that until the next generation, there will be whole new challenges waiting for the next youngsters.;"The challenges faced by the current generation are markedly different from those experienced by their predecessors. One of the most significant changes has come from globalization and industrial integration, which have transformed the workplace landscape profoundly. Today’s workforce operates in an interconnected world where competition is not limited to local or national boundaries; it extends across the globe. This shift has resulted in increased complexity in work-related challenges. For instance, employees must now navigate diverse cultural climates, digital communication tools, and remote working environments. Moreover, there is a heightened expectation for continuous learning and adaptability, as industries rapidly evolve with technological advancements. This complexity often leads to stress and anxiety, as young professionals strive to remain relevant and competitive.In addition to work-related challenges, the current generation is grappling with self-recognition issues that were less prevalent for the previous generation. Today’s youth are inundated with social media and a constant barrage of information, which can create a distorted sense of identity. The pressure to present a curated and idealized version of oneself online can significantly affect self-esteem and personal fulfillment. Unlike previous generations, who perhaps had fewer external comparisons and cultural narratives to contend with, today’s individuals are challenged to establish their identity amidst a cacophony of conflicting messages about success, beauty, and lifestyle. This struggle for self-recognition often leads to existential crises and a sense of inadequacy that can hinder personal and professional growth.In conclusion, while every generation faces its unique challenges, the current generation's dilemmas—shaped by globalization and the quest for self-identity—represent an unprecedented complexity. Addressing these challenges necessitates not only resilience and adaptability but also a deeper understanding of the socio-cultural dynamics that influence personal and professional lives in today's world."
263;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are. In my opinion, one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things. The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks.There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things. For example, if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people, you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places. By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future. These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can’t be always found in books. I do believe that great success requires taking great risks. If you want to gain very high profits in investments, you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money. If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam, you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies. The more you take risks, the greater your successes will be. If you don’t take any risks, you will have an ordinary life with average successes. That’s why it is important to take risks.In sum, I believe that success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them.;The characteristics of successful people have long been a subject of debate, with numerous perspectives emerging from various disciplines, including psychology, business, and sociology. While some attribute success to innate talent or exceptional intelligence, I contend that a significant factor in achieving success lies in the willingness to embrace new experiences and take calculated risks. This perspective underscores the importance of adaptability and continuous learning as critical components of success.One of the most valuable lessons successful individuals learn is from stepping outside their comfort zones. By trying new things—whether that involves adopting innovative strategies in business, pursuing education in unfamiliar fields, or exploring creative outlets—they position themselves to gather insights that remain unattainable to those who play it safe. These experiences foster resilience and flexibility, traits that are invaluable in navigating the unpredictable terrain of life’s challenges.Moreover, great success often demands taking great risks. This concept is vividly illustrated in the narratives of numerous entrepreneurs and leaders who have achieved remarkable feats. For instance, individuals like Elon Musk have taken monumental risks by investing in groundbreaking technologies, from electric vehicles to space travel. These ventures carry inherent uncertainties but lead to profound advancements and opportunities for growth. The willingness to risk failure fosters a culture of innovation, allowing successful individuals to learn from their missteps and refine their approaches.In conclusion, while traits such as dedication, hard work, and talent undoubtedly contribute to success, the willingness to explore uncharted territories and take risks plays a pivotal role in this equation. By embracing new challenges, successful people acquire a wealth of experience and insight, ultimately setting themselves apart in their respective fields. In a world that is constantly evolving, those who dare to experiment and learn from their pursuits are often the ones who carve a path to lasting success.
264;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations. We should consider many factors and choose the best of them. I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons:We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job. This can be done in school. In school, we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them. If we study them hard, we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future. For example, if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer, he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job. As you can see, studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job.One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation. By relating well to people, we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication. Commuincation can bring many benefits. For example, if you need help with getting a job, by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well, you can achieve your goal. Or, if you are a salesman in a store or any other place, by relating well to your customers, you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers. So, relating well to people is also another important factor. In sum, though some people may disagree with me, as I explained my reasons and examples above, none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits.;Success in the modern workforce hinges on a variety of skills and attributes, among which the ability to relate well to people and diligent study habits are paramount. As we navigate through education and into our careers, it becomes evident that these two factors work in tandem to enhance our overall effectiveness and fulfillment in our professional lives.First, the ability to relate well to others fosters strong interpersonal relationships. In any job, whether in a corporate setting, a healthcare facility, or an educational institution, effective collaboration with colleagues is essential. By developing strong relationships, we not only create a supportive work environment but also build a wide network of communication. This network is invaluable, as it opens doors to new opportunities, promotes the sharing of ideas, and enhances a team's problem-solving capabilities. The more adept we become at relating to a diverse range of individuals, the more likely we are to succeed in collaborative environments.On the other hand, the importance of studying hard and acquiring knowledge cannot be underestimated. Education equips us with the skills and understanding needed to excel in our chosen fields. A strong academic foundation provides the technical proficiency required to perform our jobs effectively. However, this knowledge must be complemented by soft skills such as empathy and communication, which are cultivated through genuine interactions with others. Moreover, effective communication is an integral part of both relating well to others and academic success. It is through clear and articulate communication that we can share ideas, motivate team members, and drive projects forward. When combined, these abilities create a dynamic professional who is not only knowledgeable but also capable of influencing and inspiring others.In conclusion, success in the workplace is a multifaceted endeavor. By balancing our academic pursuits with the art of relating well to people, we position ourselves to thrive in an interconnected world, where effective communication and collaboration are key drivers of success.
265;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.;Advertising is becoming part of our modern society. They penetrate into people's life, affecting people's choices in different things. Therefore, it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people's life. Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits, while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people's judgments. In my opinion, the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.First of all, advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit. The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people's concept of wholesome diets and self-control. It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting, regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body. However, advertising is not the only information source for people. People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources, like news or magazines. As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits, they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations. It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors. Second, in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle, some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods. In other words, advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people. Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added. These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good. In these cases, the advertising industry bolsters people's awareness of having a healthy lifestyle. In conclusion, advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits. There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter. Besides, advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle. It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away. We will always be able to decide our own lifestyles.;"Advertising has undeniably woven itself into the fabric of modern society, influencing various aspects of our daily lives, particularly consumer choices. With the constant bombardment of advertisements through different media platforms, many attribute unhealthy eating habits to this pervasive marketing strategy. However, in my opinion, advertising is not the primary cause of the unhealthy eating patterns observed in many individuals. The formation of healthy eating habits is fundamentally rooted in the concept of wholesome diets and self-control. While advertisements often highlight convenience and indulgence, it is ultimately the individual who has the responsibility to make informed choices. A person’s diet is influenced by multiple factors, including personal values, nutritional knowledge, and societal norms. Education about nutrition and the recognition of the importance of balanced meals should take precedence over the impact of advertising. Self-control plays a pivotal role; individuals who understand the significance of moderation and healthy choices are less likely to fall prey to misleading advertising.Moreover, advertising can also serve a positive purpose by promoting healthier food options and lifestyles. As society becomes more aware of the implications of unhealthy eating, there has been a noticeable shift in the types of food products being advertised. Many campaigns now focus on the benefits of eating fruits, vegetables, and whole foods, encouraging consumers to adopt better dietary practices. This emerging trend suggests that advertising can be utilized as a tool to foster healthier eating habits, rather than solely a vehicle for promoting unhealthy options.In conclusion, while advertising does influence consumer behavior, it is not the main driver of unhealthy eating habits. The foundation of a healthy diet lies in education, personal responsibility, and self-regulation. As advertising evolves, it has the potential to support healthier choices, promoting a culture of well-being and conscious consumption."
266;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Nowdays there are different resources to entertain, educate and inform people. One of this resource is television; however television has some negative effects among some people. Therefore, I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Some People spend a lot of time watching television, others even eat watching television, and some others make of this media a priority.First of all, some people spend a lot of time watching television. Instead of spend time with family and friends, they like to seat on a chair for hours. I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on, he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours. Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work, but he only let her talk during commercials. So, she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email. Time with the family is gold, some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them.Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family. This is the time, when if they have children, they can share everything about school, a project and even concerns. Also, when there is a dinner with friends, some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them. When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking, this is not the reality in some cases.Finally, some people make the television a priority. I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night. Honestly, I was in shock! How she could say that to me?. As I have said, television is a great tool to learn, entertain and inform what is happening, but I agree that television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority, spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television.";Television has long been revered as a potent medium for learning, entertainment, and information dissemination. With its diverse programming, ranging from educational documentaries and news broadcasts to captivating dramas and comedies, television serves as an invaluable resource for people of all ages. Educational channels introduce viewers to new cultures, scientific concepts, and historical events, making learning engaging and accessible. News programs keep the public informed about local and global happenings, fostering an informed citizenry. Furthermore, the sheer variety of entertainment options available allows viewers to unwind and escape into different narratives, promoting relaxation and creativity.However, the advantages of television come with certain drawbacks that can negatively impact individuals and society at large. One primary concern is the excessive amount of time many people spend in front of the screen. With binge-watching culture on the rise, individuals may find themselves sacrificing other productive activities — such as reading, exercising, or engaging in social interactions — in favor of prolonged television viewing. This sedentary lifestyle can lead to various health issues, such as obesity and cardiovascular disease, as viewers neglect physical activity.Moreover, the phenomenon of eating while watching television has become increasingly common. Many people find it more enjoyable to munch on snacks while engrossed in their favorite shows. While this may seem harmless, it can often lead to unhealthy eating habits, as viewers may consume larger quantities of food without being mindful of portion sizes or nutritional value. This mindless consumption can contribute to weight gain and other related health problems.In conclusion, while television undoubtedly serves as an effective tool for learning, entertainment, and information, it is essential to be aware of its potential negative effects. Maintaining a balanced approach to television consumption is crucial for fostering a healthy lifestyle, ensuring that we reap its benefits without succumbing to its pitfalls.
267;Do you agree or disagree with the folowing statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support;University students can be divided into two groups, one group with less interest to study and the other which include hard working students. Usually the second group's members do not have enough time to do exercise. We all know doing exercise for at least 30 minutes form the basis of the healthy and happy life. But I don't think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities.First, in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports. For example, my roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory. When she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day. As you see, she is doing exercise without spending a cent. What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health.In addition, students choose their major based on their interests. The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students. Because their major in completely involved in physical activities. In contrast, for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories, because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field.Finally, spending money on social activities looks like wasting money. For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose. For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people. In conclusion, I do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students, but I think both sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories.;University students often fall into one of two distinct categories: those who display a lack of interest in their studies and those who are dedicated and hardworking. This division can significantly influence their academic performance and overall university experience. While it is essential to foster a dynamic academic environment filled with resources like libraries and laboratories, the importance of physical and social activities should not be underestimated.Engaging in physical exercise for at least 30 minutes a day is recognized as a cornerstone of a healthy and happy life. Regular physical activity helps to reduce stress, enhance mood, and improve overall well-being. Students who partake in sports or other physical activities often find they are more productive in their studies and better able to cope with academic pressures. Moreover, social interactions during these activities can foster a sense of community and belonging, which is crucial for student mental health.However, I contend that the allocation of financial resources at universities should reflect the varying needs and aspirations of students. It is essential to invest in academic facilities like libraries and laboratories, but I argue that an equal distribution of funds to physical and social activities might not be justifiable. Instead, universities should evaluate the interests and needs of students and prioritize funding based on these assessments. Some institutions might benefit from robust academic resources due to a predominantly studious population, while others may need to enhance their recreational facilities to encourage a more balanced lifestyle among students less inclined to study.In conclusion, while both academic and physical/social activities are vital for the well-rounded development of university students, the financial investments should be tailored to the unique demands of each student body, promoting an environment conducive to growth, learning, and personal well-being.
270;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Nowadays, it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities (options) as well. On the contrary to this popular belief, there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money. However, I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option.First and foremost, I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college. Also, they can help each other for learning materials better. However, if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems. Another significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points. In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study. Finally yet importantly, appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class’s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments. However, the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times. Through this way, they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study. On the basis of the points mentioned above, I convinced that communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials. Moreover, teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it. Also, attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success.;Attending classes is an integral aspect of a student's educational experience, offering numerous benefits and a variety of learning opportunities. While some may argue that self-study or online learning can suffice, being physically present in the classroom proves to be a wiser choice for several compelling reasons.Firstly, attending classes allows students to engage in face-to-face communication with instructors and peers. This interaction can enhance understanding of the material as students are given the chance to ask questions, voice their concerns, and participate in discussions. For instance, when complex subjects arise, a student may feel more comfortable seeking clarification directly from the teacher or engaging with classmates during breaks. This collaborative environment fosters a deeper comprehension of challenging concepts, as discussions can lead to new insights and different perspectives.Additionally, being present in class helps build a support network among students. Collaborating with fellow learners can be invaluable when tackling difficult problems, as they can share diverse strategies and approaches. Forming study groups and engaging in peer-led discussions not only reinforces the learning material but also encourages students to take responsibility for their education by helping one another.Furthermore, the structured environment of a classroom can significantly enhance a student’s discipline and time management skills. Regular attendance instills a sense of routine, allowing students to better allocate their time for studying and completing assignments. This disciplined approach can lead to improved academic performance, as students are more likely to stay organized and prepared for assessments.In conclusion, while there are alternative methods of learning, attending classes offers uniquely beneficial opportunities that self-directed study often lacks. The chance to communicate with instructors and peers, seek assistance, and develop time management skills makes being present in class a crucial element of a comprehensive educational experience.
271;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Telephones and email have made communication between people less personal. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There are many advantage of these invention, telephones and email. Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier. I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication, telephones and email, made people less personal. I will give several reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, telephones and email help people, who live far away from other people, to connect each other. Unlike email, send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address. I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with. For example, right now, I am in the U.S. It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents, who live in my country. Consequently, I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want. Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents.Second, using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication. For instant, sometime when I argue with my friends, I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment. So, when I have a time to realize what had happened, I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion. Thus, these types of communications make me feel personal.Telephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love. Beside, I could express my personal thought through telephones and email. As a result, I believe that telephones and email do not make communication between people less personal.;"Communication in today's fast-paced world has been revolutionized by the advent of telephones and email, making life significantly easier and more efficient. These tools allow for quick and direct connections with others, which can be particularly beneficial in both personal and professional contexts.First and foremost, the convenience of being able to talk or write directly to people I wish to connect with is invaluable. With just a call or an email, I can reach out to friends, family, colleagues, or acquaintances regardless of their geographical location. This instant access transcends time and space, enabling discussions that might have been impossible before the digital age. For instance, I can maintain relationships with friends living miles away, or I can collaborate with colleagues across different time zones without the impediment of travel or extensive waiting times. This immediacy fosters a sense of connectivity that strengthens relationships and enhances productivity.Moreover, I find that I can express important thoughts and feelings more effectively through written communication than in face-to-face conversations. Writing allows me to take the time to craft my message carefully, ensuring clarity and precision. This is particularly useful when discussing sensitive topics that may evoke strong emotions; having the opportunity to formulate my words reduces the chances of misunderstandings that can occur in direct dialogue. Additionally, emails provide a written record of communication, which can be referred back to if needed, lending an extra layer of assurance and accountability.In conclusion, communication via telephones and email has transformed how I interact with others, allowing for greater convenience and clarity in expression. The ability to connect directly, coupled with the precision that written communication affords, has made my life significantly easier in navigating both personal and professional relationships."
272;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;I highly prefer living in a big city to living in countryside. The big cities have lots of advantages and facilities over the small towns. Where a person lives and grow up is very important to his future life, because the environment that a person grow up, build the personality and his/her culture.There are lots of social places in big cities like restaurants, museums, bars, sporting clubs, cinemas, theatre and etc. People in big cities have many options to enjoy their life and spend their times with their friends in social places in contrary to people living in small towns who have few choices and at most cases one bar or one cinema to socialize with their friends.In big cities educational facilities is quite better than small towns with more experienced and profession teachers. It’s undisputed that in this modern world education has a very important role in the human kind future life. Better education results better career and been well paid. So persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns. Also lots of companies placed in big cities and there are more job positions in there than small towns.But by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation, because distances in big cities often are too far to pass quickly. Every technology has it’s good and bad effects but I prefer having the technologies with their disadvantages to living like 16 century without any of modern facilities of technology. In addition to what mentioned, medical technologies is completely better in big cities and in my view this profit overcomes all the bad influences of technologies on human kind.In conclusion, in my view living in big cities is quite funnier and better and more exciting than living in small towns because of many more social places, technologies facilities, better education and medical services.;In the modern world, urbanization has transformed the landscape of social interactions and access to amenities. Big cities are vibrant hubs teeming with an array of social places, offering diverse options for their residents to engage in leisure activities. From restaurants serving international cuisine to museums showcasing cultural heritage, cities provide countless opportunities for socialization. Bars and sporting clubs serve as popular gathering spots for friends, while cinemas and theaters cater to a variety of entertainment preferences, making urban life richly dynamic and socially engaging.In stark contrast, individuals living in small towns often grapple with limited choices when it comes to social venues. Typically, these towns might boast just one bar or a single cinema, which can restrict social interactions and lead to a repetitive experience. This limited availability can stifle community engagement, making it challenging for residents to find novel ways to connect with one another. While small towns offer close-knit communities, the lack of variety can sometimes hinder social growth and exploration.Moreover, one cannot overlook the advancements in medical technology that are prevalent in larger cities. Urban centers usually host state-of-the-art medical facilities equipped with the latest technologies, offering residents better healthcare services and specialized treatments. This aspect is particularly crucial, as access to quality healthcare can significantly impact overall well-being. In my view, the benefits of advanced medical facilities in cities far outweigh the negative aspects of technology, such as increased screen time or urban stress. The assurance of receiving timely and effective medical treatment is a substantial advantage for city dwellers, enhancing their quality of life and providing peace of mind.In conclusion, while the social landscape is vastly different between big cities and small towns, the advantages offered in urban environments—ranging from ample social opportunities to superior medical care—make city life more appealing in many respects. These factors contribute significantly to the overall well-being of their residents, highlighting the profound impact of urbanization on social and healthcare experiences.
273;Some people like to do only what they already do well. Other people prefer to try new things and take risks. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;You may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren't good at the things. That may help you expand experiences, look for your personalities and find your new talents. This ideal, however, doesn't necessarily be accomplished. If not, you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things. So, I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at.Focusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal. Without doubt, the more time you spend on what you do well, the more likely to achieve something great you will be. For instance, Albert Einstein, one of the most competent physicians in history, devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity. Instead, he hardly cared about something else. It is said that, surprisingly, he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because, at least for him, using two different soups properly was quite annoying. As the example above indicates, you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well.If you keep doing what you already do well, you can be better good at it. When you're doing something well, you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it. Then, you will motivate yourself to do more. To give an example, I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school. Because I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably, I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems. As a result, I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems. Thus, by doing what you are good at, you will be better at it.In summary, doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better.;Embracing new experiences and taking risks can be a delightful and enriching part of life. Trying new things, whether they be hobbies, career opportunities, or social activities, opens up pathways for personal growth and self-discovery. However, it is essential to recognize that not every endeavor will result in success or demonstrate our inherent talents. In fact, diving into unfamiliar waters often leads us to realize our limitations and the areas where we may not excel. This acknowledgment should not deter us but rather motivate us to prioritize our strengths.Focusing on what we are good at is a strategic approach to achieving our goals. When individuals dedicate their time and energy to hone their existing skills, they set themselves up for greater success. Mastery often comes from deliberate practice, and the more time invested in cultivating our talents, the better we become. For instance, a budding artist may find joy in experimenting with different mediums but will ultimately flourish by concentrating on their preferred style or techniques. This commitment allows for the development of a unique voice, setting them apart in a competitive field.Moreover, centering our efforts on our strengths leads to increased confidence and motivation. When we experience progress—however small—via our dedicated practice, it reinforces our belief in our abilities. This, in turn, propels us toward achieving something great. The journey might still involve experimentation and occasional forays into the unknown, but the foundation built upon our strengths serves as a sturdy base from which to explore.In sum, while the thrill of trying new things and taking risks is invaluable, we should not overlook the power of focusing on our strengths. By channeling our energies towards what we excel at, we maximize our potential and pave the way towards remarkable achievements in our lives.
274;In order to become financially responsible adults, children should learn to manage their own money at a young age. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?;One of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility, specially in financially matters. Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility? many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood. I am a kind of person who believes to children should learn to manage their own money at a young age, due to reasons that I stated below.The first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life, even though when we are not borne. So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues. To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood, when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked. First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished. I asked my father for extra money, but he refuse to give it to me. I found that I should manage the way that I spend money. From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted.Another aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family. If parents get the children all they wanted, they would be run out of their money for their essential needs. Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money, when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity. As a case in point, I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family, his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood. He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money. His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life, but unfortunately it was useless. Finally one night, having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car, he crashed a truck and died. Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property, but also bring sorry to his family.Although some people argue that children should be free to spend money to they what they want, In my opinion it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons, because our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood.;The debate over when children should learn financial responsibility is a poignant one. While some argue that financial education should be reserved for adulthood, I firmly believe that teaching children to manage their own money from a young age is crucial for their long-term success and independence.Firstly, instilling financial literacy in children early on equips them with essential life skills that are vital in today’s complex economy. By managing small amounts of money, children learn about budgeting, saving, and making informed spending decisions. This hands-on experience fosters a sense of responsibility and encourages critical thinking about financial choices. For instance, children can enjoy practical lessons by saving their allowance for a desired toy or snack, which teaches them the value of patience and delayed gratification.Moreover, early exposure to money management can pave the way for healthier financial habits later in life. Research supports that individuals who learn financial responsibility as children are more likely to budget effectively, avoid excessive debt, and save for emergencies. By the time they reach adulthood, these lessons can reduce the likelihood of financial stress and contribute to overall well-being. Children who grasp concepts such as compound interest and the significance of a savings account will find themselves better prepared for real-world financial challenges, from managing student loans to understanding mortgages.Finally, fostering financial independence in children promotes self-confidence and decision-making skills. When children learn how to manage their own funds, they gain a sense of control over their lives, which can lead to increased autonomy and empowerment. This confidence can extend beyond finances into other areas of their personal and professional lives.In conclusion, teaching children to manage their money at a young age sets the foundation for responsible financial practices. As they develop these skills, they prepare themselves for a future where financial stability and independence are attainable goals, ultimately contributing to their success as adults.
275;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Dancing plays an important role in a culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;In every country, people do dance for fun, for entertrain, and for decrease a stress. Dancing is also one of important parts of culture that represent to something that people believe. Many cultures do dance to show a great prosperous of its culture. And also dancing to entertain people. I will give reasons to support my opinion.First, dancing are significant part of culture that could show to something that people believe. For example, some culture people believe that they dance in order to sacrifice to their god so they will be get a happy life. Or some part of the world that are in arid area believe that if they danced, the rain would come. Consequently, dancing are the part of people belief.Secondly, dancing can represent to civilization of that culture. For instance, I have seen many western movies that when a kingdom have visitor from another kingdom, king or queen would dance to show a splendid of their kingdom culture. The way of movement, the way that they costume and also a music while they dance. All this is a civilization of their culture.Thirdly, many culture, people have many ways to entertain themselves. And dancing is one of that ways. Both people who see and dance also have a good time. For example, many event, such as christmas, last christmas I went to mall to buy gifts, and I was entertained by group of people in santa custom dancing in christmas song. I felt that people around me happy and group of santas also happy to see people happy.In conclusion, I strongly agree with notion that dancing is an important part of culture because dancing are represent to believe of people. Besides, dancing could show how civilization of that culture is. Moreover, people use dancing to entertain themselves. So dancing is important in every culture.;Dancing is a universal form of expression that transcends geographical boundaries and cultural differences. In every country, people engage in dance not only for fun but also as a means of entertainment and a method to alleviate stress. Whether it is at celebrations, social gatherings, or leisure activities, dancing provides a platform where individuals can connect, enjoy themselves, and express their emotions.Moreover, dancing plays a significant role in the cultural identity of a society. Each dance style embodies the values, traditions, and beliefs of a particular culture. For instance, traditional dances often narrate historical events or celebrate the natural world, serving as a reflection of the civilization's heritage. In many cultures, dance is tied to rituals, ceremonies, and celebrations that mark important life events such as weddings, birth, or harvests. Thus, through dance, people preserve and transmit their cultural narratives to future generations.Additionally, dance is an essential tool for self-entertainment. In our fast-paced world, where stress often accumulates, dancing offers a release—an opportunity to let loose and be free. It allows individuals to disconnect from their worries, boost their mood, and promote physical well-being. The joy of dancing, whether in a group or solo, can foster community spirit and create lasting memories.In conclusion, dancing serves multiple purposes in societies across the globe. It is not only a delightful pastime that alleviates stress and entertains but also a vital expression of cultural heritage that represents the beliefs and civilizations of its people. As we continue to dance, we honor our past while simultaneously celebrating the joyful act of movement, community, and connection.
276;Do you agree or disagree with following statement? It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.;There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not. Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students, I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives. In the following, I will state my reasons for this choice.First, when students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations. As a case in point, more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts. As a result, they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better. Second, it would improve students' social behavior. If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well. They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well. Thus, if they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life. Moreover, these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts. As a matter of fact, when a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently. In my viewpoint, concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life. It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position. All in all, I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons. Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc.;"The debate over whether understanding ideas and concepts holds more significance for students than rote learning of facts is a contentious one. However, I firmly believe that learning factual information provides invaluable advantages that better equip students for their future lives. By emphasizing the acquisition of facts in education, we prepare students to confront real-world challenges effectively and enhance their social behavior.First and foremost, knowledge of factual information allows students to develop problem-solving skills that are crucial for navigating life’s complexities. When students are armed with a wealth of facts, they can draw upon this knowledge to analyze situations, make informed decisions, and devise practical solutions. For instance, a student knowledgeable in historical events may better understand current societal issues and engage in discussions about potential resolutions. This grounding in factual knowledge empowers students not just to tackle academic challenges, but also to address everyday life problems with confidence and efficacy.Moreover, an understanding of facts enriches students' social interactions. Knowledge serves as a tool for communication; individuals who possess substantial information are often more engaging conversationalists, which can foster better relationships. When students learn interesting facts, whether about science, history, or current events, they enhance their ability to contribute to discussions, connect with peers, and participate in community activities. This, in turn, promotes social cohesion and cultivates a sense of belonging. In conclusion, while grasping concepts and ideas is undeniably important, prioritizing the memorization and application of factual information delivers immediate and practical benefits for students. It prepares them to face life’s challenges and fosters stronger social interactions, ultimately setting the foundation for a successful and fulfilling future."
277;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;There are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes. It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities. Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges, I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students' lives. In the following, I will state my reason for this choice.First, besides the good body shape, sports have very vital effects on human's healthfulness. In my viewpoint, our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly. As a case in point, last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back. After that exam, I felt depressed and exhausted. Therefore, I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well! As a result, sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health.Second, besides the academic knowledge, the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human's life. As a practical epitome, students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation. Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other's mind and different environment. In my opinion, social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment. So, social activities have same rights to receive monetary support.Moreover, they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments. If we follow just one wing of my life i.e., studying as a student, after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn't have any motivation. Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends. In my perspective, more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me.All in all, I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above-mentioned reasons. They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way.;The debate surrounding the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with traditional academic classes has garnered significant attention. In my viewpoint, sports and social engagements play crucial roles in fostering a well-rounded education, particularly concerning students' health and well-being. Firstly, the benefits of engaging in sports are multifaceted. Regular physical activity significantly enhances overall health, promoting cardiovascular fitness, strength, and flexibility. For students, who are often burdened with academic pressures, participating in sports provides a necessary outlet for energy. It not only helps in maintaining a good body shape but also contributes to improved mental health. Physical activity releases endorphins, which are essential for combating stress and anxiety—common issues among students. Additionally, being on a sports team teaches valuable life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and leadership, which are essential both in and out of the classroom.Furthermore, social activities are indispensable in building interpersonal skills. They provide opportunities for students to interact with peers, understand different perspectives, and adapt to diverse environments. Engaging in social activities cultivates empathy and enhances communication skills, which are vital in today’s interconnected world. Beyond the educational benefits, these activities also foster a sense of belonging and community, allowing students to have fun and develop friendships that can last a lifetime.In conclusion, while main academic classes are undeniably important for intellectual development, sports and social activities should not be overlooked. They are essential for cultivating a balanced and healthy lifestyle, enhancing mental well-being, and equipping students with critical social skills. By embracing a holistic approach to education that integrates sports and social activities, we set the stage for students to thrive both in academics and in their personal lives.
278;Some people say that the internet provides people with a lot of valuable information. Others think access to so much information creates problems. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In the modern society, internet is considered as one of the most important inventions over the past century. Some people believe that several problems occur from an information on the internet. However, some say that the internet provides a lot of valuable information. In my opinion, I agree with the latter because the internet gives daily necessary information, people can gain knowledge and they can explore the world.First of all, everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives. Sometimes, they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people. For example, a businessman who has no time to watch a television or read a newspaper can receive news and check stock markets easily via the internet.In addition, people can gain more knowledge by using the internet, the most useful technology in the world. Many people such as students can take online courses to study at home or they can watch beneficial videos which also teach them knowledge. Not only students but also everyone could get more information and knowledge. For instance, people who have problems with their health can search for more information about it.Last but not least, The internet makes the world becomes smaller which is a good thing. This is because people who have no time or have financial problems could travel around the world by using the internet. They can see lots of picture and videos of many interesting places. Moreover, people can learn other countries's culture and tradition which makes them have more knowledge about that nations.To conclude, people are satisfied with the internet and sometimes even thanks it because it helps us in studying, doing business and exploring the world. With valuable information it provides, people can enjoy their lives much more.;The internet stands as one of the most significant inventions of the past century, revolutionizing the way we communicate, learn, and interact. This vast network of information has made it possible for individuals to access knowledge and resources with the click of a button, facilitating global connections and fostering innovation. While some may argue that the internet has given rise to various problems, I firmly believe that its benefits far outweigh the drawbacks, as it offers daily necessary information, enhances our knowledge, and allows us to explore the world like never before.First and foremost, the internet is a treasure trove of essential daily information. From news updates to weather forecasts and educational content, individuals can stay informed about local and global events instantly. This connectivity empowers people to make informed decisions in their daily lives, ultimately fostering a more aware and engaged society. For instance, during emergencies or natural disasters, timely information disseminated online can be crucial for public safety and preparedness.Moreover, the internet serves as a platform for vast knowledge dissemination. Online courses, tutorials, and academic resources enable individuals to learn at their own pace, breaking geographical and financial barriers. This democratization of education allows anyone with an internet connection to acquire new skills, whether for personal development or professional advancement. Platforms such as MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) exemplify this trend, offering courses from prestigious institutions to learners worldwide.Lastly, the internet provides an unprecedented opportunity to explore the world beyond one's immediate surroundings. Virtual tours of museums, cultural exchange programs, and travel blogs enrich our understanding and appreciation of diverse perspectives and lifestyles. This global access cultivates empathy and awareness, essential qualities in our increasingly interconnected world.In conclusion, while acknowledging the potential problems arising from the internet, its positive impacts on daily life, education, and global exploration are undeniable. The internet not only serves as a vital resource for information but also acts as a gateway to knowledge and understanding, making it one of humanity's most transformative inventions.
279;Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Others universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life. Some universities require students to study in one subject. On the contrary, others require students to study in several subjects. In my point of view, studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in, they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future.First of all, when students finished their high schools, they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities. This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all. For example, pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music. Therefore, requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them.In addition, people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one. Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study. For instance, university students who study business are also know history of the world. Furthermore, students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers. Hence, they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another.Finally, students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career. This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer. For example, students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include. Moreover, bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge.In concluding, learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject because it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future.;Universities play a crucial role in shaping the intellectual and practical skills of individuals, preparing them for the complexities of the real world. While some universities require students to specialize in a single subject, I believe that studying multiple subjects offers a more enriching and versatile educational experience. This multifaceted approach not only caters to students’ varied interests but also equips them with a broader knowledge base, enhancing their adaptability in a dynamic job market.Studying multiple subjects allows students to delve into areas they are genuinely passionate about. For instance, a student interested in both environmental science and political science can understand the intricate relationship between environmental policies and ecological sustainability. This integrated knowledge fosters a deeper comprehension of complex issues, enabling students to engage critically and creatively with the world around them. When students have the autonomy to explore diverse disciplines, they are more likely to find a fulfilling career path that aligns with their interests and values.Moreover, acquiring knowledge in different fields empowers students with a unique skill set. In today’s rapidly evolving job market, employers increasingly value versatility and interdisciplinary skills. A graduate who has explored subjects ranging from economics to psychology is better equipped to tackle multifaceted challenges that require innovative solutions. This breadth of knowledge not only enhances employability but also opens doors to numerous career opportunities.In conclusion, while specialization has its merits, the benefits of studying multiple subjects far outweigh the drawbacks. By allowing students the freedom to explore various disciplines, universities nurture well-rounded individuals who are better prepared for the complexities of modern life. This approach cultivates curiosity, fosters critical thinking, and ultimately leads to a more fulfilling academic and professional journey.
280;Some people think governments should spend as much money as possible exploring outer space (for example, traveling to the Moon and to other planets). Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Although developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting, there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation. Thus, these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity. Therefore, in my opinion, I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first.First, as you can see that after great economic recession, many people in many countries were unemployed. Then, many people did not have money. When people did not have money, They had to rob other people. There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities. Consequently, quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy. So that, government should invest to create more jobs. When people have jobs, they did not have to steal money. Therefore, criminal rate were drop. Thus, people have a good quality life.Second, environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it. Nowaday, industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide, which caused of greenhouse effect. Greenhouse effect causes of climate change. These impact on every living creature in the world. So, government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide. In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide, government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy. If we lived in good environment, our life would be better.Lastly, family is a root of society. If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other, that family could have problems, If family had problems, it mean society could have problems. When society had problems, it could impact to a nation. Thus, government should create campaign to fill love to family. For example, setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other. When family understand each other, it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble.In conclusion, I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs. The basic needs: jobs, good environment, and love in family. These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people.;In my opinion, the government should prioritize addressing the basic needs of its citizens before delving into more complex policies and programs. The foundation of a stable, prosperous society is built upon the well-being of its individuals, and nurturing fundamental needs such as employment, a healthy environment, and familial love should be the foremost concern of any governing body.Firstly, jobs are a critical component of human dignity and self-sufficiency. When individuals are unemployed or underemployed, they struggle to provide for themselves and their families, leading to increased poverty and social instability. Therefore, governments must focus on creating job opportunities through investments in various sectors, from technology to manufacturing. Additionally, ensuring access to vocational training and education can empower citizens to secure better employment, which in turn fuels economic growth and societal improvement.The second essential need is a good environment. A clean and safe environment is vital for health and well-being. Pollution, climate change, and deforestation not only threaten biodiversity but also compromise public health. Governments should implement policies that promote sustainability, enhance public transportation, and create green spaces. By fostering an environment where citizens can thrive, governments help to ensure a better quality of life.Lastly, the importance of love and support within families cannot be overstated. Families are often the primary source of emotional and social support, and strong family units contribute positively to society. Governments should recognize this by providing resources for mental health services, family counseling, and community programs that strengthen familial bonds.In conclusion, when a government addresses the basic needs of jobs, a good environment, and love in families, it lays the groundwork for a thriving, cohesive society. By prioritizing these aspects, governments can foster resilience, ensure stability, and promote the overall well-being of their citizens.

These make people get stress. Thus, many people try to reduce their stress. There are many activities that could relieve those people who are in stress. in my opinion, reducing stress by listening to music, playing sports, and doing meditation are easy and practical ways.First of all, listening to music is a great way to relax. For example, when I go to office, I use public transport. I see many things such as traffic jam, crowded people at bus stop, and all so crowded people in buses. These make me stress. So that I always listen music from my mp3 player. I could enjoy listening music without thinking of people around me. Consequently, I feel happy when I listen music.Second, another way that is perfectly work for everyone to reduce the stress is exercise. For instance, I alway have many things in my mind such as a difficult of my work that I have to finish in time. These problem sometime make me hard to fall asleep because it make me stress. Thus, after work, I always do exercise, and jogging is my favorite sport. I feel that after working out, I am easily to fall asleep. Exercising not only reduce my stress but also make me get a good health.Third, meditation also one of the ways to reduce the stress. when I have many things to think about, and this make me stress, I will do meditation.

These could relieve me from stress. In conclusion, there are many ways to reduce the stress. In my point of view, listening to music, exercising, and doing meditation are the most activities that people could do to escape from stress. It is are easy and usable.

Fortunately, there are simple yet effective strategies to alleviate stress, including listening to music, playing sports, and practicing meditation. In my view, these activities are not only practical but also easily accessible, making them ideal for anyone looking to escape the burdens of daily life.Firstly, listening to music is one of the most enjoyable and immediate ways to reduce stress. Music has a unique ability to influence our emotions and can evoke feelings of relaxation and joy. Research shows that certain genres, such as classical and ambient music, can lower blood pressure and heart rate, promoting a sense of calm. Furthermore, creating personalized playlists tailored to an individual's mood can enhance this experience, allowing people to immerse themselves in their emotions and temporarily disconnect from stressors.Playing sports also offers a dual benefit of physical exercise and social interaction. Engaging in sports releases endorphins, the natural “feel-good” hormones that can instantly brighten one’s mood. Whether it’s a casual game of basketball, a run in the park, or a yoga class, physical activity provides an outlet for pent-up energy and frustration. Additionally, the camaraderie often found in team sports fosters a sense of community, which can significantly alleviate feelings of isolation during stressful times.Finally, meditation is a powerful tool for managing stress that encourages mindfulness and self-reflection. It allows individuals to focus on the present moment, leading to reduced anxiety and improved emotional balance. By incorporating practices like deep breathing or guided visualization, anyone can create a peaceful mental space, even in the midst of chaos.In conclusion, listening to music, engaging in sports, and practicing meditation stand out as effective, approachable methods for stress relief. By incorporating these activities into our daily routines, we can enhance our overall well-being and cultivate a more balanced, fulfilling life.
282;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn. Give specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Everyone is different. Although students are in the same process of education system, learning abilities in each students are not equal. Some students are fast learner, but some students are not. Thus, paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate, and it is not fair for teacher. So that, I disagree with this notion.To begin with, in schools, main task of teacher to give knowledge to students, and this role have to finish in time. there are certain period of time for teachers to teach. In these short time, it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class. Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule. If teachers pay attention to specific students, their work might not finish on time, and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know.Second, learning abilities in each students is different. It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time. Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not. Therefore, testing result are different. This problems depend on how hard study they do. It is not teachers fault. Thus, teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get.Lastly, there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get. That is problem in quality of education. Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics. Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary. This problem should not be happened. Therefore, grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher.In conclusion, I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class. Besides, learning abilities of student are different. Moreover, there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get.;"In the educational system, the teacher’s primary responsibility is to impart knowledge to students within a constrained timeframe. This objective requires a structured curriculum and a pace that may not always align with the individual learning needs of each student. Within this limited time frame, it becomes increasingly challenging for teachers to provide personalized attention to every student in their class, particularly in environments with large student populations.One of the critical aspects of teaching is the recognition of diverse learning abilities among students. Each student comes with their unique background, cognitive capabilities, and pace of grasping new concepts. While some may excel and comprehend the subjects being taught with ease, others might struggle to keep up. This disparity highlights the limitations of a one-size-fits-all educational approach, where teachers are expected to deliver knowledge uniformly to a heterogeneous group of learners.Furthermore, assessing a teacher's effectiveness based primarily on the test results of their students can be misleading and unfair. Test scores may not accurately reflect the teacher's capabilities or teaching quality; rather, they often reflect the varying levels of student preparedness or learning differences. A teacher might provide well-structured lessons and engage students effectively, yet if some individuals still struggle to achieve high scores, it should not diminish the overall value of the teacher's efforts.Ultimately, it is essential to acknowledge that the educational landscape is intricate and multifaceted, necessitating a more nuanced approach to evaluating teacher performance. Assessments should consider not just the outcomes but also the context in which learning occurs, emphasizing the worth of teachers who inspire, motivate, and foster a love for learning, regardless of test results."
283;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Movies and television programs should present stories in which good people are rewarded and bad people are punished.;When we watch movies or dramas, some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished. While there are also some people who do not like this. Personally, I prefer to see good people get rewarded. However, if the good people always get an happy ending, I don’t think it’s proper.First, if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring. If good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas. Then we will feel less interested in them. But if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story. For example, Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl. But now many people, including me, have been tired with it. I don’t want to see the same kind of ending again and again. So we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs.Even in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes. And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies. So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world. They will be misleading by those movies. And they may act like good people in order to get reward. Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person. But in fact, the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not. So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding.In fact, those good endings sometimes are helpful. Some people may be encouraged to do good things. But like I said, this kind of behavior won’t last long, because someday they will realize the truth. So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories. And if they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends.Based on my arguments above, I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing.;Movies and dramas often depict a world where good triumphs over evil, culminating in happy endings where virtuous characters achieve their desires while the bad ones face consequences for their actions. This narrative fosters a sense of hope and justice, creating an engaging storyline that many viewers find satisfying. However, this portrayal can distort the realities of life, suggesting that ethical behavior always leads to success and that wrongdoing will invariably be punished. In truth, the world is far more complicated, and good people can, unfortunately, experience bad endings despite their integrity.It is crucial for us to acknowledge the discrepancy between fiction and reality, especially when it comes to impressionable children. Young audiences are highly susceptible to the messages conveyed in films and dramas, often taking these narratives at face value. They may develop an unrealistic belief that being good guarantees happiness and that life’s hardships are solely a consequence of one’s moral standing. This notion can lead to disillusionment and a misunderstanding of justice, which is often imperfect and not always aligned with merit.By fostering discussions about these discrepancies in narrative outcomes, we can help children develop a more nuanced understanding of life. It is essential to teach them that hardships can befall even the kindest individuals while also recognizing that justice may not always be served in the way we expect. Encouraging resilience and understanding that failure and adversity are part of life can equip the next generation with the tools they need to navigate a more complex world. In doing so, we can ensure that children appreciate the value of goodness while also preparing them for the inevitable challenges that life may present.
284;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;There are many advantages of distance learning, but it should not replace classroom learning. Learning in classroom could provide more information to study. Besides, learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills, and learning how to solve problem in real situation. Consequently, I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt. Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example. For example, in biology class, learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits. Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog. Unlike classroom, online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation.Secondly, online class could not provide knowledge about social skills. For instance, In a classroom, teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group. This could help students to learn how to deal with people, how to collaborate with people in their group. This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes.Lastly, learning in classroom, student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body. Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way. If student do it by themselves, they might be hurt themselves. This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide. In conclusion, I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class. Because, classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject. Besides, classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill. Moreover, classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health. Thus, having classroom could provide abundant skills to students.;Distance learning has proven to be a valuable educational method, offering flexibility and accessibility that traditional classroom learning may not always provide. However, while it presents numerous advantages, I firmly believe that it should not replace conventional educational experiences. Here are the reasons supporting my stance.Firstly, classroom learning fosters personal interaction between students and teachers, which is pivotal for a holistic educational experience. In a traditional setting, students have the opportunity to engage in face-to-face discussions, receive instantaneous feedback, and develop essential communication skills. These interactions can significantly enhance their understanding of the subject matter and their confidence in expressing ideas, something that distance learning often lacks due to its reliance on technology.Secondly, the structured environment of a classroom promotes discipline and accountability. In a physical classroom, students are required to attend classes regularly, which helps instill a sense of responsibility toward their studies. The structure of a set timetable can keep students motivated and focused, whereas distance learning may lead to procrastination and a lack of engagement for some individuals. Moreover, the social aspect of classroom learning plays a vital role in a student’s development. School provides a unique environment for students to form lasting friendships, learn teamwork, and develop social skills through group activities and collaborative projects. These experiences are less likely to occur in an online setting, where the limited scope for social interaction can make learning a lonely endeavor.Lastly, not all subjects lend themselves well to online learning. Courses that require practical labs, hands-on workshops, or artistic demonstrations often benefit from the resources and facilities available in a traditional classroom. In conclusion, while distance learning offers significant advantages, it should complement, rather than replace, classroom learning. The interactive, structured, and socially engaging aspects of traditional education are integral to a well-rounded educational experience and should remain a priority in our pursuit of effective learning methods.
285;What are some of experiences that have shaped your outlook and the way you live now.;Many circumstances that I experienced change the way I think. There are many experiences that are improve my life in many way. For example, I could improve the way that I solve problems, improve how I take care of my health, and improve to plan my life for future. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems. For example, in math class, the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step. Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem. I could adapt this method to use my real life. When I want to go to somewhere, I try to find the way to reach to destination. Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time. I could find a better way to solve problems.Secondly, Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself. For instance, reading and listening the news about choosing a good diet are the way to keep myself are more healthy. Thus, I am always buy a quality food such as organic food. This food are not have chemical. So that, I can have a good health. This experience teach me to aware my health.Lastly, experiences are also change to plan for my future life. For example, I read about saving money for my retire is a good plan for my life. Consequently, I start changing myself from spending many thing that I want to saving money for my entire life. This experience change me to concern about making plan for my future life.In conclusion, experiences that shape my thinking and the way to live my life are teach me to be a better person. Because I could find a better way to solve problems. Besides, experiences could shape me to be more aware about my health. Moreover, these experiences could make me to make plan for my future life. These experiences taught me to change my life to be a better person.;"Life is a continuous journey of growth and learning, shaped significantly by the various experiences we encounter. As I reflect on my own journey, I realize that many circumstances have profoundly altered the way I think and approach problems. One major turning point was my time at university, where I was confronted with challenges that prompted me to adopt a more prudent mindset. In an academic setting, the stakes are often high, with deadlines looming and expectations set by professors. Navigating these pressures taught me the importance of careful planning and strategic problem-solving. I learned to evaluate situations from multiple angles, weigh the pros and cons, and devise a thoughtful approach to tackle issues. This shift in my thinking has transcended beyond academics; it has permeated other aspects of my life, allowing me to confront challenges with a unique perspective and a more thoughtful approach. Moreover, certain experiences in my personal life served as valuable lessons in self-care. For instance, moving away from home for the first time forced me to manage my own finances, meals, and mental well-being. I became acutely aware of the need to prioritize my health—both physical and emotional. Through trial and error, I learned how to create a balanced routine that includes exercise, healthy eating, and mindfulness practices. These lessons have equipped me with the skills necessary to maintain a sense of stability and well-being in the face of life’s inevitable ups and downs.In conclusion, my university education and personal experiences have significantly influenced my mindset and ability to navigate life’s challenges. I have emerged as a more prudent individual and someone who understands the importance of self-care. These transformations reflect the power of experience in shaping our thoughts, actions, and overall outlook on life."
286;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreigh language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Give the advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Knowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time. Many people pursue to study foreign language. There are two options to learn foreign language. First is stay in homeland to study foreign language. The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken. Going to another place to learn language is better choice. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language. For example, everyone around me speaks foreign language, and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people. If I could not communicate with other people, I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger. This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language.Secondly, having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster. For instance, English school in outside my home country, there are many people that come from different places and from different languages. The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language. Thus, I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong. This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster.In conclusion, I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people. Besides, in foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends. Learning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language.;In today’s interconnected world, the importance of learning a foreign language cannot be overstated. With globalization facilitating communication across borders, the ability to speak another language has become a valuable asset in both personal and professional realms. Many individuals are increasingly pursuing studies in foreign languages, recognizing that this skill is essential for navigating diverse cultures and enhancing career opportunities. While there are various methods to learn a language, traveling to a foreign country for immersive learning is arguably the most effective choice. One of the primary reasons for this belief is the immersive experience that comes with being surrounded by native speakers. When individuals travel to a country where the target language is spoken, they encounter real-life situations that demand active communication. This immersion forces learners to practice their speaking and listening skills in a practical context, significantly enhancing their fluency and comprehension. Unlike traditional classroom settings, where learning can sometimes feel abstract or theoretical, engaging with the culture through everyday interactions solidifies language skills and builds confidence in utilizing them.Moreover, learning a language in its native environment offers exposure to cultural nuances that are often lost in textbooks. Idiomatic expressions, accents, and local dialects can only be fully appreciated when one experiences the language in context. This cultural immersion not only enriches the learning process but also fosters a deeper appreciation for the traditions and customs of the speakers, promoting empathy and global citizenship.In conclusion, as the importance of foreign languages continues to grow in our increasingly global society, pursuing language studies through immersive experiences abroad stands out as an invaluable choice. The combination of practical application and cultural exposure equips learners with the skills and understanding necessary to thrive in a multicultural world. Therefore, considering travel as a learning strategy can greatly enhance one’s language acquisition journey.
287;If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place. However, it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements. In my hometown, there are almost complete public utilities for one’s needs but transportation. So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation. Since I’m facing the traffic congestion every day. And this problem seem to get worst. At first, it should have more alternatives to use public transportation, such as a subway train or a sky train. Hence, people will have more ways to go to a place. Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community, It makes people in this area have no choice. They must take only a bus to go to another place. If a subway and a sky train are available here, it will be more convenience to them. For example, people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule. On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus. Also, this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly. Secondly, the buses provide merely two routes in this community. It is absolutely a major problem. For example, if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses, I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus. Obviously, it is waste of time. They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily.Lastly, having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars. Also, it provides many advantages. For instance, people can save their expenses form gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive. The necessary energy will slowly be used up, since people use less their own cars.To sum up, the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people’s living. I wish one day this problem would be changed. And then, the transportation in my hometown is no longer difficult for everyone in this community.;When considering the pivotal factors that influence the decision to reside in a particular place, public utilities and surroundings emerge as key components. Public utilities, including water supply, electricity, sewage, and waste management, significantly contribute to the quality of life and overall satisfaction of residents. In my hometown, I have observed that the availability of almost complete public utilities plays a considerable role in making it an attractive place to live. The basic necessities are well-catered for, ensuring that residents can lead comfortable and convenient lives. However, one area where my hometown falls short is transportation. While we have essential services like water and electricity in abundance, the limited public transportation options hinder mobility and accessibility. Many residents rely heavily on personal vehicles due to the scarcity of effective public transportation systems, which can create issues such as traffic congestion and increased carbon emissions. Additionally, not everyone has access to a car, making it challenging for some community members, particularly the elderly and low-income families, to reach essential services, jobs, or recreational areas.To enhance our community's livability, I believe it is crucial to invest in improving public transportation. Increasing the frequency and reliability of buses, introducing well-planned routes, and implementing affordable fares would significantly benefit our residents. Such improvements would not only ease the burden of transportation but also encourage more sustainable practices by reducing the reliance on personal vehicles. Furthermore, an efficient public transportation system can connect different parts of the community, thereby fostering social interaction, economic growth, and inclusivity.In conclusion, while my hometown boasts strong public utilities, the lack of reliable transportation remains a pressing issue. By prioritizing the enhancement of public transport, we can create a more cohesive and accessible community for all residents, significantly improving their quality of life.
288;Schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Getting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance. Thereby, evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system. Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students. Therefore, I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers.To begin with, Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance. For example, evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product. Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information. Consequently, teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give. Therefore, evaluating from students could improve teachers' performance.Additionally, this evaluation from students could improve schools' quality. Teachers could augment their quality. Consequently, When school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality. For instance, in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high. Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students.Finally, people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students. Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance. Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects, students could comprehend their subject easily. As a result, students, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life.In conclusion, I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance. Moreover, schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers. Furthermore, students are easy to understand their subjects. Thus, I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers.;In the contemporary educational landscape, the enhancement of performance across varying levels of the educational system is a pivotal goal. One effective method to achieve this enhancement is by actively soliciting opinions and feedback from students. Incorporating student evaluations serves not only as a mechanism for teachers to refine their instructional techniques but also as a catalyst for broader systemic improvements.When students provide feedback on their learning experiences, they offer unique insights that can be invaluable to educators. Their perspectives shed light on what teaching strategies resonate with them, what materials they find engaging or challenging, and how learning environments can be optimized for better outcomes. By listening to students, teachers can adapt their methods, ensuring that they cater to diverse learning styles and needs. This iterative process of feedback and adjustment enhances the effectiveness of individual educators.Moreover, the benefits of student evaluations extend beyond the teacher-student dynamic. When educational institutions commit to analyzing feedback from students, they are in a position to identify systemic trends and challenges. This broader evaluation often reveals areas needing improvement, such as curriculum design, resource allocation, and support services. Consequently, by addressing these systemic issues, schools can create a more robust educational environment that fosters optimum learning for all students.In conclusion, the practice of obtaining and utilizing student opinions is essential for elevating performance within the educational system. By embracing this participatory approach, educators can not only improve their own practices but also contribute to a more effective and responsive educational framework. Ultimately, the inclusion of student voices is a critical strategy for ensuring that educational systems continually evolve and improve, thereby enhancing the overall quality of education for future generations.
289;Some people prefer to work for a large company. Others prefer to work for a small company. Which would you prefer? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.;Companies vary from small to large ones based on the context, success and needs of their work. Small companies usually have a local job in the area, while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries. I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons.First, to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company. Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing, managing and selling their products in different countries. For example, if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country, they would need more employees in that country to work there. In other words, Large company equals more job opportunity.Second, I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one. The fact that a company is a large one, this means that it's having a considerable success. In other words, this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees. For instance, common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won't give the same salary as a small local company.Third, I love travelling around the world. large companies have an international reputation, as they organize international conferences, meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people. As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops.In conclusion, i can certainly state that I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one. I have different reasons to hold that, such as having a better chance to find work, having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences.;In today's job market, the choice of working for a small or a large company can significantly influence one's career trajectory and experiences. While small companies typically serve local communities and contribute significantly to their immediate economies, large companies operate on a much grander scale, often supplying products and services internationally. Personally, I have a strong preference for working in a large corporation, and several key reasons underpin this inclination.Firstly, the process of securing a position at a large company is often more streamlined and accessible than in smaller firms. Large corporations tend to have structured recruitment processes and greater resources dedicated to hiring, making it easier for candidates to apply for and secure roles. Furthermore, they often have dedicated human resources departments that can guide applicants through the hiring process, increasing the chances of finding a suitable job.Secondly, large companies generally offer more competitive salaries and benefits compared to their smaller counterparts. This is largely due to their broader market reach and substantial revenue streams. Working for a company with the financial capacity to offer higher wages not only enhances one's standard of living but also provides access to better benefits, such as health insurance and retirement plans, which can contribute to an individual's long-term financial security.Lastly, one of the most exciting aspects of working for a large company is the opportunity to travel. Many global organizations operate in numerous countries, allowing employees the chance to engage with different cultures and environments. For someone who loves to explore the world, the prospect of international assignments can be incredibly appealing. Traveling for work can enrich one's personal and professional life, offering experiences that go beyond the confines of a local setting.In conclusion, while both small and large companies have their unique advantages, my preference leans heavily towards large organizations. Their accessibility in job search, competitive compensation, and opportunities for travel make them an attractive option for ambitious professionals like myself, eager to thrive in a dynamic and interconnected global economy.
290;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;No one can disagree that knowledge is the most important for everyone. College and university are playing in an important role to provide academic skills to people in order to pursue their goal. There are an issue that some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students however there are others people who think that everyone should have this chance to gain these advance skills from college or university. This issue will be discussed.First of all, many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students. The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money. College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time. They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students. Consequently, mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university.On the other hand, there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education. Of course, higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try. Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change. With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future. Thus, mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university.In conclusion, I personally agree with that college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal. Students can have opportunity to learn, to practice, to gain more knowledge for their career and for their future. Studying in college and university is a great opportunity that all students should have.;Colleges and universities serve as pivotal platforms for individuals seeking to acquire academic skills tailored to their personal and professional objectives. These institutions not only impart knowledge but also foster critical thinking, creativity, and interpersonal skills that are essential for success in various fields. However, a debate arises regarding accessibility to higher education. Some argue that admission should be reserved for academically proficient students, while others contend that everyone deserves the opportunity to gain advanced skills.Proponents of restricting access to high-achieving students often argue that maintaining rigorous academic standards is necessary to ensure the quality of education. They believe that admitting only those with proven academic capabilities creates an environment that fosters excellence and prepares students for competitive careers. According to this perspective, resources such as funding, faculty attention, and institutional prestige should be preserved for individuals who demonstrate a commitment to academic achievement.Conversely, the argument for inclusive access highlights the importance of equal opportunity in education. Advocates argue that every individual, regardless of their academic background, should be afforded the chance to develop skills that can transform their lives. This view acknowledges that many capable individuals face socioeconomic barriers that hinder their academic performance but possess the potential to excel with the right support and resources. By broadening access to education, society can cultivate a diverse range of talents and perspectives, ultimately enriching the academic community and the workforce.In conclusion, while academic standards are crucial, the opportunity for higher education should not be limited solely to good students. A balance must be struck between maintaining excellence and promoting equity in education. By providing broader access to academic skills, colleges and universities can empower a wider array of individuals to pursue their goals, fostering a more inclusive and dynamic society.
291;Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed to play it.Ê;It is a debatable subject that children should not be allowed to play computer games since playing computer games is a a waste of time. I hold a positive view against this opinion. First and foremost, a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined. An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week, while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days. Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games, because of their low control ability. Second, children could learn nothing from these computer games, therefore time on this activity is really time wasting. Since all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children, majority of the games use war, violence, bloody, or sexual subjects to lure the students. However, those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths. Admittedly, there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career. But we have to realize the fact: majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying, sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games. It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar, and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar. In conclusion, I believe it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games. The computer games are like cigerate to adults and we need to set up rules to regulate this area.;In recent years, the rise of online computer games has become a significant concern among educators and parents alike. A large number of students exhibit an obsessive engagement with these games, leading to a notable decline in their academic performance. The allure of virtual worlds is often irresistible, consuming hours of valuable study time and replacing it with mindless entertainment. This shift in focus ultimately results in diminished grades and a lack of motivation toward educational pursuits.One of the most troubling aspects of these games is their lack of educational value. While some may argue that certain games can enhance cognitive skills, the majority do not impart any meaningful knowledge or life skills. Instead, they often promote negative themes, immersing players in environments rife with violence, war, and even sexual content. Rather than fostering creativity or critical thinking, these games frequently desensitize students to aggression and normalize inappropriate behaviors. As a result, the time spent on these activities often becomes a colossal waste, diverting attention from the intellectual development crucial during formative years.Moreover, the themes prevalent in many of these games can be particularly damaging. By continuously exposing young minds to war, violence, and other grim subjects, these games can skew their perspectives, making such elements appear thrilling or trivial. This manipulation of interests can lead to a distorted understanding of reality, exacerbating issues related to aggression and emotional desensitization among adolescents.In conclusion, the obsession with online computer games among students is not merely a harmless hobby but a troubling trend that significantly impacts their academic performance and moral development. It is imperative for parents and educators to intervene, guiding children toward healthier hobbies and educational pursuits that provide both enjoyment and intellectual growth.
292;Do you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mails. Why?;When it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email, I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication. Firstly, team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently. Obviously, discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails. An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity. The first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email. The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one. The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other. Secondly, work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members. Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official, therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing. While if the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim. Therefore, less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members. Admittedly, sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place. Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none. Since it is a classroom or campus projects, there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas. While we should realize that in a project, there are numerous coordination works are required, if each opinion is communicated via email, there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience. In conclusion, I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email because work in person will be more efficient.;The dynamics of teamwork play a crucial role in the successful execution of any project, and the mode of communication significantly influences these dynamics. Working in-person can indirectly enhance the quality and efficiency of a project by fostering a collaborative environment that minimizes conflicts among team members. When individuals are physically present in the same space, they are more likely to engage in spontaneous discussions, share immediate feedback, and address misunderstandings before they escalate. A study conducted by Beijing University underscores this notion, revealing that face-to-face communication significantly expedites the process of reaching agreements among team members. The researchers found that when people are able to converse directly, they can navigate through differences of opinion more swiftly and effectively. This spontaneous interaction not only allows for the clarification of ideas but also helps to build camaraderie and trust, which are the cornerstones of a productive team environment.Conversely, while email and other forms of digital communication are valuable tools in modern workplaces, they do possess inherent limitations that can hinder the collaborative process. Emails often lack the immediacy and nuance of in-person conversations, leading to potential misunderstandings or delayed responses that can stall project progress. Although better than having no communication at all, emails can create barriers that complicate efficient teamwork. In summary, the benefits of in-person collaboration can be substantial, especially in complex projects requiring the input and cooperation of multiple stakeholders. The evidence from the Beijing University study emphasizes the effectiveness of direct communication in reaching consensus. Therefore, fostering an environment that encourages in-person interactions, even occasionally, can prove to be a vital strategy for improving team productivity and the overall quality of work.
293;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?;These days, more and more university professors are involved in scientific research. Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching. However, according to my experiences, professors should be encouraged to mainly do research.First of all, doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors. Universities are relatively fenced environment. The research projects provide communication with the outside. In addition, by doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies. I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college. He was often invited to do speech in other universities. Although my university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects. The research projects like windows opened to the wider world.Secondly, professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities. It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus. Also, you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together. Consequently, there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages. We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin. Universities positively contribute the professors' success. Last but not least, doing research could also improve the teaching quality. With the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom. They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice. I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project. By participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments. The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching. For those reasons, it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research. While extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society.;In recent years, there has been a noticeable trend among university professors increasingly engaging in scientific research alongside their teaching responsibilities. While some critics argue that this focus on research could potentially compromise the quality of education, I contend that professors should be encouraged to prioritize research endeavors. Firstly, involvement in research enhances professors' expertise and keeps them at the forefront of their fields. When educators actively participate in cutting-edge research, they acquire fresh insights and innovative methodologies that can enrich their teaching. For students, this means access to firsthand knowledge and the latest findings, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world applications. In my experience as a student, having professors who are actively involved in research has significantly deepened my understanding of complex subjects. Their enthusiasm and firsthand accounts of current developments inspire students to engage more deeply with the material.Moreover, research contributes to a vibrant academic environment, fostering a culture of inquiry and discovery. When professors are actively pursuing their own research projects, it encourages students to think critically and engage in independent study. In collaborative projects, students often get the opportunity to contribute to ongoing research, providing them with invaluable skills and experiences that will benefit them in their future careers. Additionally, universities themselves benefit from faculty engaged in research. A strong research profile attracts funding, enhances the institution's reputation, and can lead to more opportunities for students, including internships, networking, and partnerships with industry. These elements can create a robust educational experience that goes beyond traditional classroom learning.In conclusion, while concerns about the potential decline of educational quality due to a focus on research are valid, the benefits of professors engaging in scientific inquiry far outweigh these risks. Encouraging faculty to prioritize research ultimately enhances the educational experience, fosters a culture of critical thinking, and prepares students for the complexities of the modern world.
294;Do you learn better by yourself or with a teacher ?;Every person learn in their own manner which they think that is most expedient to them. As for the learning by yourself, it has some certain profit. It gives you a chance to concentrate on what you learn cause there is no one who distracts your attention in presence of you, and your learning becomes more profound. In addition, the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework, Nevertheless, I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself. Firstly, The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies. In other words, when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out, that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly. In addition, professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge, and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study. They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages. Hence I, in my class, often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem, and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher. Secondly, in my mind, the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself. We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself. Furthermore, the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction. Moreover, This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree. knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened.Finally, of course, being without a teacher has shortcomings. Notable one of the shortcomings is that if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried, this might be ended in disappointment. I think that for one who depends on only himself in learning, his improvement of ability, with regard to cooperation and express his opinion, is unpromising. Hence I support this point that the learning with a teacher is better.;"In the realm of education, the debate between self-directed learning and learning with a teacher has garnered significant attention. Personally, I find that learning with a teacher offers a myriad of advantages that self-learning simply cannot match. While self-study fosters independence, it often lacks the rich interactions and feedback that a traditional classroom setting provides, particularly when it comes to developing essential interpersonal skills.One of the most compelling reasons for preferring teacher-led learning is the opportunity for collaboration. Engaging with a teacher allows for a dynamic exchange of ideas, fostering an environment where questions can be asked freely and discussions can be held in real-time. Teachers are not just dispensers of knowledge; they act as facilitators who inspire curiosity and critical thinking. In a classroom, students can engage with their peers, expressing their thoughts and opinions, which is vital for honing communication and teamwork skills. This interaction cultivates a sense of community and encourages diverse perspectives, enriching the learning experience.In contrast, relying solely on self-directed learning can lead to a somewhat isolated educational experience. While it may enhance self-discipline and autonomy, it often falls short in developing social skills. Sticking to solitary studying might inhibit one's willingness to collaborate or share ideas with others, limiting opportunities for rich discussions that refine one's understanding. Furthermore, without immediate feedback from a teacher, students might struggle to identify gaps in their comprehension or correct misunderstandings promptly.In essence, while self-directed learning has its merits, the advantages of learning with a teacher are too significant to overlook. The guidance provided by an experienced educator not only bolsters individual knowledge but also cultivates crucial skills in cooperation and self-expression. Thus, for a well-rounded educational experience, I firmly believe that learning with a teacher is far superior to solitary study."
295;Technology designed to make people's lives simpler often turns out to make them more complicated.;Many people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology. With newly developing technologies, people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy. For example, we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver's license or drive to bank for sending money. Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians. However, even with all the conveniences, we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated. There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer.Of course, new technologies are always great. However, it takes time for people to adapt them. Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day, many people often get lost. For instance, I use new Iphone which I personally think is great. However, even though I used it for couple months, I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently. At first, I tried to go through all the instructions but, soon, I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn. Next, technology destroys the language. Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others, they created their own language to communicate. Because people try to type as fast as they are talking, they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language. This has gotten worse with twitter, myspace, and facebook. What are even worse, young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions. To clarify, my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of. I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative.Although technologies allowed us to have a convenient life, it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above.;"The impression that we are blessed to live in an era of high technology is prevalent among many individuals today. Indeed, technological advancements have brought about unprecedented convenience and efficiency. However, it is crucial to recognize that these same technologies have also complicated our lives in various ways. One evident complication arises from the overwhelming influx of information. The internet provides us with a wealth of resources and knowledge at our fingertips, yet this saturation of content can lead to confusion and indecision. For instance, when searching for a product or service online, the multitude of options available can be paralyzing, forcing consumers to wade through countless reviews, comparisons, and advertisements. This phenomenon, often referred to as ""analysis paralysis,"" detracts from the simplicity that consumers once enjoyed when making choices.Additionally, technology has transformed our communication methods, ironically making it more challenging to connect on a personal level. While social media platforms and instant messaging applications facilitate communication across vast distances, they often diminish the quality of our interactions. The ease of sending a text message or posting on social media can lead to superficial relationships, leaving individuals feeling more isolated despite the illusion of connectedness. In face-to-face interactions, nuances such as body language and tone are lost, fostering misunderstandings and a lack of genuine connection among individuals.Furthermore, the constant need to stay updated with technological advancements can result in significant stress. Society has set an unspoken expectation to be perpetually connected, leading to a relentless cycle of checking notifications and emails. This obsession with instant access can hinder our ability to engage in deep, focused work and detracts from our overall wellbeing.In conclusion, while high technology has undeniably made many aspects of life easier, it has also introduced a layer of complexity that challenges our ability to navigate our daily lives effectively. It is essential to balance the conveniences technology affords us with the awareness of its potential pitfalls, ensuring that we harness its benefits without becoming overwhelmed by its complications."
296;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"There are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion. As far as I am concerned, I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning. I list my reasons as follows.First, indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes. In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates, because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better, it will force you for making your performance more better. For example, When I was in First Year in B Com, I was not serious in my study, but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me, it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects. Finally I got 1st rank in final exam.Second, in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time. It makes you perfect in time management skills. Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others. It makes you communication and of course your group skills better, which can help you in your future and career.Third, professors play vital role in classroom learning, most of them are specialists is their subjects, and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills. You can improve your skills by work under any professor; you can ask questions face to face, it will clear your doubts. In result you learn quickly. For example, I have my personal experience. For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses, but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT, and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster.It's undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary, but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning. From the discussed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons.";Classroom learning has long been regarded as an effective method for providing education, especially when compared to online classes. One of the most significant advantages of traditional classroom settings is the structured environment they offer. In a classroom, students are required to complete their study work on time, fostering a sense of accountability and discipline. This necessity helps students cultivate time management skills, which are crucial not only in their academic pursuits but also in their future careers. The ability to prioritize tasks and meet deadlines is a skill that translates well into the professional world, where time is often of the essence.Another pivotal aspect of classroom learning is the role of professors in the educational environment. Professors serve not only as educators but also as mentors who provide valuable insights and guidance. Their presence enhances the learning experience by facilitating discussions, addressing student queries, and offering personalized feedback. In a classroom setting, students can engage in immediate interactions, clarifying doubts and deepening their understanding of the subject matter. This dynamic interpersonal exchange is often absent in online classes, where communication may be limited to pre-recorded videos or text-based forums.Moreover, the classroom atmosphere encourages collaboration among peers. Group projects and in-person discussions foster teamwork and a sense of community, which can be lacking in the often isolating online format. This social interaction not only enriches the learning experience but also helps develop vital interpersonal skills that are essential in any professional setting.In conclusion, while online classes offer flexibility and accessibility, classroom learning provides a structured environment that enhances time management skills and fosters valuable relationships with professors and peers. The traditional classroom setting remains an essential component of education, preparing students more effectively for both their academic and professional futures.
297;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think this is a good idea? Support your opinion by using specific reasons and details.;"When we talk about student, we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college. In some country, teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study. However, some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study. In my view, it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he/she is still a student and this is for two reasons.The main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job, before starting their real job. Students can learn about time management, money management and convince people by their words. For example, when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year. As i had to spend some of my time in my job, therefore, i had to manage my time efficiently. I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework. This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively. Moreover, I learn money management. When my boss was out of the shop, i had to manage the accounts section of the shop. From this i learned, how to manage money correctly. This experience taught me, doing part time job can help students to learn many things.Another reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money, which can help their parents. For instance, when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor. I taught math to two kids of my neighbor. I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books. By tutoring them, i earned some money and bought me books with it. Moreover, after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents. As you can see, part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially.In sum, I am sure; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students. They will argue, it can destruct students from their study. However, as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result; therefore, i believe part time job will be good for students. Every Student should do part time job beside their study if they want to prepare more efficiently for their future.";The debate surrounding whether teenagers should engage in part-time jobs while pursuing their education is a contentious one. Some individuals argue against this concept, citing concerns about the potential distraction from studies and the risk of burnout. However, I firmly believe that part-time jobs can offer numerous benefits to teenagers, allowing them to develop crucial life skills and contribute positively to their families.One of the most significant advantages of holding a part-time job while studying is the opportunity for teenagers to learn essential time management skills. Balancing work obligations with academic responsibilities requires careful planning and prioritization, helping students to organize their schedules more effectively. This experience can foster a sense of responsibility and discipline, qualities that will serve them well in their future endeavors. Moreover, part-time jobs provide teenagers with the opportunity to learn about money management firsthand. Earning an income enables them to develop budgeting skills, understand the value of money, and make informed financial decisions. These are invaluable lessons that extend far beyond the classroom, equipping students with financial literacy that will benefit them throughout their lives.Additionally, working in a part-time job allows students to enhance their communication skills. Engaging with customers, colleagues, and supervisors builds their ability to convince and negotiate effectively. These interpersonal skills are vital in today’s job market, as they contribute to teamwork and networking opportunities.Furthermore, many teenagers take up part-time jobs to financially assist their families. In a world where expenses are rising, contributing to household income can alleviate some financial pressure on parents, fostering a sense of unity and shared responsibility within the family.In conclusion, while some may criticize the idea of teenagers working while studying, the benefits of part-time work far outweigh the drawbacks. The life skills learned through such experiences can significantly shape their future, promoting personal growth, accountability, and financial awareness. It is crucial that society recognizes the value of part-time jobs as a positive opportunity for young individuals.
298;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Given advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Our World has varied cultures and each culture has its own language. It has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language as one do interacts with foreigners once in a lifetime and learning a foreign langauge adds on to a person skill-set as well. Also, I think its better that people learn foreign language in their own country. The reasons for holding that opinion are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs.First of all, it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language as it requires large amount of money and legal formalities. In the earlier periods, it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge. But with the advent of globalization, one can easily find a teacher in their own country. For example, in Indian sub-continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french, german etc.Second, colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum. Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university. So, it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country. Also, highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges.Third, technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country. A large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages.To sum up, it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country. It is cost effective and there is a pool of opportunities available now to accomplish the same.;In today’s globalized world, the ability to communicate in a foreign language has become increasingly essential. Interactions with foreigners, whether for travel, business, or cultural exchange, are an inevitable part of life. As such, learning at least one foreign language not only enriches personal experiences but also enhances professional opportunities. Moreover, it is beneficial for individuals to learn foreign languages within their own country, as the upcoming paragraphs will illustrate.Firstly, learning a foreign language enables individuals to engage meaningfully with people from diverse backgrounds. Whether attending international conferences, traveling to foreign nations, or simply meeting expatriates in one’s own vicinity, knowing a foreign language fosters deeper connections and mutual understanding. This ability to communicate proficiently can lead to valuable friendships, collaborations, and a broader worldview. For instance, business professionals who can converse in the native language of their international clients often build trust faster and negotiate more effectively.Secondly, acquiring a foreign language in one’s home country can be a more accessible and comfortable experience. Local language courses are typically tailored to address the specific needs of learners in their cultural context, making the learning process more relevant and engaging. Additionally, learners can ask for guidance and support from educators who understand the challenges they face. Studying a foreign language domestically also allows for immersion in the language through local communities or cultural events, thereby enhancing the learning experience without the intimidating aspect of being abroad.In conclusion, learning a foreign language has become an indispensable skill in our interconnected world. Engaging with foreigners enhances personal and professional relationships, while studying a foreign language in one’s home country provides a supportive environment that encourages growth and confidence. As societies continue to evolve and interact, the importance of this linguistic skill will only continue to grow.
299;Some people believe that students should be given one long vocation each year. Other believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Everybody require some break from their tight schedules likewise students also require vacation form their intense academic schedules. Many people promote one long vacation system of the school because it would help student to start their course or academic year with strong zeal of learning. So other several, prefer numbers of short breaks during the year so that student can get rejuvenate periodically. In both the scenario students relief themselves. However, i discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics.Firstly, several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low. Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student's get relief form exam pressure. However, research done by universities proves that student's performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning, preparation and examination schedule. Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester. Also several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course.Secondly, scientific research provide several authentic survey of the students' performance after break. It states that students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation. To quote an instance, in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams. During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes. I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game. During my all vacations, I used to miss my school due to which I used to restart my session with great enthusiasm of learning and scoring good marks in new quarter.Vacations are not only required by students but also by professionals and housekeepers. As it not only provide break to them from their regular commitment but also allows them to spend some time on themselves, heel stressful mind and boost desire of resuming to the regular schedule. Therefore schools should consider giving several small vocations to the students during the year.;The debate over the structure of school vacations is one that has drawn considerable attention. Some advocate for a single, elongated vacation period, arguing that it allows students to return to their studies with renewed enthusiasm. However, I contend that multiple shorter breaks throughout the academic year are more beneficial for students’ overall well-being and academic performance.One significant advantage of several small vacations is the reduction of stress levels among students. The academic year can be quite demanding, with students facing rigorous coursework, exams, and various extracurricular activities. By incorporating shorter breaks—such as long weekends or inter-term holidays—students have the opportunity to decompress, recharge, and address personal commitments. This not only prevents burnout but also allows them to approach their studies with a fresher perspective when they return to class.Additionally, mini-breaks can enhance academic engagement. Instead of the long gaps that can lead to disengagement and difficulty transitioning back into study routines, short vacations create an environment in which students can consistently refresh their minds. For example, after periods of intense learning, students might return to their lessons more focused and eager, having had the time to reflect on what they’ve learned and to incorporate new experiences.Moreover, shorter breaks can also enable students to engage in various activities, such as internships, volunteering, or travel, which contribute to their personal growth and learning beyond the classroom. These experiences can enrich the curriculum and provide students with valuable life skills.In conclusion, while a single long vacation may seem appealing, the advantages of multiple shorter breaks—such as reduced stress and improved academic engagement—make them a more effective choice. A balanced schedule fosters a healthier learning environment where students can thrive both academically and personally.
300;"The expression ""Never, never give up"" means to keep trying and never stop working for your goals. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use specific reasons and examples to support your reasons.";"""Keep running!,"" shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move. During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014, I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute. At some moment, my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary. I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty. From this experience, I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals. Firstly, committing to our goal helps creating personal worth. For example, I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard. Even if I were not to win this medal, I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running. Secondly, one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger. I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line. However, I did not give up, and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself. I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning, and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger. Thirdly, at some point, we, as an average people, might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on. I believe that the responsibility is worthy of carrying. When the distance is longer and harder to achieve, a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself. He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal. For these reasons, I agree that one should not give up, as the true reward is to have the dignity. Anyone who wants to achieve the goal should acknowledge that his effort and experience from suffering helps him understand his true potential and increase his strength, and ultimately, it will prompt him to be ready for overcoming the greater challenge in his life.";"Pursuing a goal can be a long and arduous journey, often filled with challenges and setbacks. At nearly thirty years of age, I experienced a moment that reaffirmed my belief in the power of persistence: I won a medal in a competition that I had been fervently preparing for. This achievement not only marked a significant milestone in my life but also served as a catalyst for personal growth.For many years, I harbored aspirations of excelling in my chosen field—an objective that seemed ever elusive. Each step along the way was fraught with obstacles. There were times when I doubted my abilities or questioned whether my efforts would ever yield positive results. However, I learned an invaluable lesson during this period of uncertainty: the importance of resilience. Every setback I encountered taught me something about my strengths and weaknesses, pushing me to engage in self-reflection and improvement.Winning the medal was not merely a testament to my skill; it symbolized the culmination of my perseverance through years of hard work, dedication, and continuous effort. I realized that success is not merely a destination but a journey marked by gradual progress. This experience solidified my conviction that one should keep trying for their goals, no matter how challenging the path may be.In essence, my journey has instilled in me a deep-seated belief that persistence is key. Each failure should not dishearten but rather motivate us to press on. Goals may seem daunting, but the fulfillment that comes from achieving them is worth the struggle. As I reflect on my experience, I encourage anyone chasing their dreams to remain steadfast, for the fruits of their labor will eventually blossom, transforming aspirations into reality."
301;Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses. But isn't it better to save your money for later investments or rough times? Im my opinion, saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments, neither in your professional nor your personal life, furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams.First, there are several uncertainties about your professional future. The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account. As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe. Some of them had no own savings. They could not afford the rent, so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence.In addition, you can not be sure about the development in your personal life. It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings. Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car. He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it. Finally, with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams. Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished. For instance, I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend. Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream.Considering all the above mentioned arguments, from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time.;In recent years, many developed countries have experienced notably low saving rates, a trend largely attributable to consumer behavior characterized by immediate spending and increased reliance on personal loans. This phenomenon reflects a cultural shift where individuals prioritize present consumption over future financial security. The allure of instant gratification, fueled by targeted marketing and easy access to credit, has led many to forgo the benefits of saving. While the immediate enjoyment of goods and experiences may offer temporary satisfaction, in my opinion, saving a portion of one's earnings is essential, particularly in a world where future developments are often unpredictable.The unpredictability of life is one of the strongest arguments for maintaining a healthy savings habit. Events such as job loss, medical emergencies, or economic downturns can occur without warning and can devastate an individual's financial stability. A robust savings account acts as a safety net, providing individuals with the necessary cushion to navigate these unforeseen circumstances without succumbing to financial distress. Moreover, having savings empowers people to take calculated risks, such as starting a business or pursuing further education, without the shadow of immediate financial insecurity looming over them.Furthermore, saving promotes long-term financial planning and discipline. By setting aside a portion of income regularly, individuals develop a mindset focused on future goals rather than short-term attractions. This not only ensures greater financial independence but also encourages responsible spending habits, fostering a culture of delayed gratification that can lead to more significant rewards down the line.In conclusion, while the temptation to spend is undeniably strong in today's consumer-driven society, the importance of saving cannot be overstated. By prioritizing savings, individuals can protect themselves against unforeseen challenges and build a more secure future — a fundamental practice in achieving lasting financial well-being.
302;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Modern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously. However, while the majority of people live on the fast lane, others decide to reduce the speed and take their time. To draw an entire picture, we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better. In my opinion, it is very important to live life at a slower pace, because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages.First, living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health. If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off, your body will react to your stressful lifestyle. Many hardworking people have diseases, like the burn-out syndrome, because their bodies cannot hold the pace. For instance, my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job. After several weeks off his body was restored, now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine.In addition, living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness. If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved's. If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends. Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level. For example, a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it, because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships.Finally, quality takes time. When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush, you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes. Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities. As a result you might make mistakes, you would not have done with more patience. To illustrate, I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade, because I made few mistakes I could have avoided.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, living a slower life is advantageous for your health, your happiness and even the quality of your work.;In recent decades, modern technologies and globalization have dramatically increased the pace of life, transforming the way individuals interact, work, and manage their daily routines. While this rapid advancement has brought numerous benefits, such as instant communication and accessible information, I firmly believe that slowing down is crucial for overall well-being. The fast-paced lifestyle that many people choose comes with significant disadvantages, primarily stress and its detrimental effects on health.Living life in the fast lane often leads to chronic stress, which can manifest in various forms, including anxiety, irritability, and burnout. The relentless pursuit of deadlines, constant connectivity, and the expectation to always be “on” create an overwhelming sense of pressure. This not only affects mental well-being but can also lead to severe physical health issues. Studies have shown that prolonged exposure to stress can contribute to problems such as heart disease, weakened immune systems, and gastrointestinal issues. In an age where the emphasis is on efficiency and productivity, individuals frequently neglect self-care, which exacerbates these health risks.Moreover, the culture of immediacy fosters a disconnection from the present moment. This hurried lifestyle can detract from the joy of everyday experiences, such as spending time with loved ones, enjoying nature, and engaging in hobbies. By embracing a slower pace, individuals are better able to cultivate mindfulness, enhancing their ability to appreciate life’s simple pleasures and build deeper relationships.In conclusion, while modern technologies and globalization have led to a faster-paced world, it is essential to recognize the importance of slowing down. The stress associated with a hurried life can have serious repercussions on health and well-being. By deliberately choosing to live at a more measured pace, individuals can foster a more balanced, fulfilling life that prioritizes health, happiness, and meaningful connections.
303;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree with this point of view? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer;In the past centuries the population steadily grew and now, for the first time in history, is exceeding seven billion. As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing, feeding and industry. But isn't it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet? In my opinion, we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons.First, the natural diversity is very important for further generations. If we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet. As we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem. To illustrate, every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland. If we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct. As a result, further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals.In addition, a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather. Our behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming. This not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes. For example, recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average. This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions.;In recent centuries, the global population has steadily increased, culminating in an unprecedented milestone: for the first time in history, the world's population has exceeded seven billion people. This remarkable growth brings with it a myriad of challenges, not least of which is the detrimental impact on our natural ecosystems. As humanity expands its presence across the planet, we are relentlessly destroying vital habitats, including forests, jungles, and lakes. This destruction not only threatens the countless species that inhabit these areas but also undermines the essential services these ecosystems provide to humanity.Forests, for instance, are crucial for maintaining biodiversity, regulating the climate, and purifying air and water. Deforestation and habitat destruction rob the planet of its ecological balance, leading to the extinction of species and the disruption of food chains. Additionally, these actions contribute significantly to climate change, as trees that once absorbed carbon dioxide are removed, resulting in increased greenhouse gas emissions that exacerbate global warming.The urgency of creating a stable and sustainable environment cannot be overstated. Weather patterns are intrinsically tied to the health of our ecosystems. Disruption in natural habitats leads to unpredictable weather conditions, increased severity of natural disasters, and altered rainfall patterns, which can jeopardize agriculture and water supplies. Our behavior, characterized by rampant industrialization and consumption, fosters pollution that further intensifies these issues. From air and water pollution to noise and soil degradation, human activities leave a lasting mark on the planet.In conclusion, as the global population continues to surge, it is imperative that we recognize the responsibility that comes with it. Protecting and restoring our natural habitats is crucial not only for the survival of diverse species but also for ensuring a stable and sustainable environment essential for maintaining the delicate balance of weather on Earth. Only through concerted efforts to reduce our ecological footprint can we hope to create a harmonious existence with our planet and secure a healthier future for generations to come.
304;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.Ê;University students have different opinion about their attendance to class. Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students. According to my opinion, because it is university level of education, students have enough maturity to choose their choice. Therefore, I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students.To begin with, going to classes are sometimes waste of the time. For instance, some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module. Further, they didn't explain the contents in order to understand by the students. It was waste of the time. Because the university students have grown up, they have enough ability to read and understand the text book. Moreover, with the modern technology, students can collect more information from different sources. For example, from the Internet, students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently. However, some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way. When the students attend that lectures, they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time.Additionally, mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures. Besides, most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time. Students need to work as part time basis. Hence, they have to schedule the lectures time, studying time and working time. At the same time, rather than attending any boring lecturers, students can participate to other activities such as debate competition, swimming meet, Basketball and so forth. From that they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them. In a nutshell, although few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures, some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students' time. When the students go to university, they have matured mentally and physically. They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do. Therefore, to make use of time, if the students choose the classes as optional, it would provide more benefits than drawbacks.;"The debate over whether university students should be required to attend classes or if attendance should be optional is one that has garnered varying opinions. In my view, given the maturity and autonomy that university students possess, attendance should indeed be left to the discretion of the individual. One of the primary arguments for making class attendance optional is that many students have developed the skills necessary to manage their own education. University is a stage in life where individuals are transitioning into adulthood, and with that transition comes the responsibility of making choices about one's own learning. Many students have different learning styles; some may thrive in a traditional classroom setting, while others may prefer to study independently or seek out resources online. Forcing attendance can sometimes result in students feeling disengaged or unmotivated when the material may not appeal to them.Additionally, some classes can feel like a waste of time when the material is already known or when the teaching style does not resonate with the students. This is not to say that all lecturers are ineffective—indeed, some are incredibly skilled at delivering lectures in an informative and captivating way. However, the effectiveness of a lecture can vary greatly, and students should have the freedom to determine what is worth their time and attention. By allowing them to choose whether or not to attend, universities empower students to take charge of their education and focus on areas that genuinely interest them.In conclusion, the decision about class attendance should be left to students, as they are capable of making informed choices about their learning. This autonomy not only respects their maturity but also acknowledges the diverse ways through which students can engage with their education effectively. Ultimately, fostering independence can lead to a more motivated and engaged student body."
305;Technology makes people's lives simpler rather than makes people's lives more complicated.;Believe it or not, nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not, thus making them confused. Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier. Although I conceded technology may make people's life complicated in some aspects, the convenience it brings is more. In what follows, I will illustrate my point of view.First, when it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler. With a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle. Alternatively, if you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times.Second, technology also makes teaching simpler. In the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers. With the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards, it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once.Admittedly, to some extent, technology may make people's life more complicated. For example, the cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications. For instance, folks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them. In addition, games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones. Consequently, making their life more complicated and tired. Based on the factors I have mentioned above, a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people's life complicated in some cases, the convenience it brings in people's are significant.;In today's fast-paced world, the impact of technology on our daily lives has been a topic of considerable debate. Many individuals grapple with the question of whether technology simplifies life or only adds to its complexity. While it is true that technology can introduce complications, I contend that the convenience it brings far outweighs these challenges.One of the most significant benefits of technology is the ease it provides in communication. Platforms like social media, messaging apps, and video conferencing have revolutionized the way people connect, allowing for instant communication regardless of geographical barriers. Friends and family can maintain relationships across vast distances, and professionals can collaborate seamlessly without being in the same room. This ease of connection can enhance personal bonds and improve workplace efficiency.Moreover, technology has transformed everyday tasks, leading to significant improvements in convenience and time management. Online shopping, for example, allows consumers to purchase goods from the comfort of their homes, saving time and effort. Similarly, mobile banking and digital payment systems streamline financial transactions, making it easier to manage money and pay bills promptly. With access to a wealth of information and digital tools, individuals can automate tasks, set reminders, and access services instantly, all of which contribute to a more organized and efficient lifestyle.While it is undeniable that technology comes with its challenges—such as information overload, privacy concerns, and dependency issues—the convenience it offers is often a source of empowerment. People can choose how they interact with technology, allowing them to tailor it to meet their needs.In conclusion, despite the complexities that technology may introduce, its ability to simplify life through enhanced communication, efficiency, and accessibility cannot be overstated. Embracing technology with a balanced perspective can lead to an enriched and simplified existence.
306;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines and other media pay to much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;"Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs. Others believe that television, newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well. This issue is a controversial one, but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons. One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples' lives in order to increase their audience or readership. Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs. Thanks to the Internet, we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don't need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience. Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip. Nowadays, unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training. Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos. Additionally, there are Reality TV, television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations, for example like ""Big Brother"".To sum up, it is clear that television, magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above, namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV.";In today’s society, mass media plays a pivotal role in shaping public perception and conversations. However, it has often been critiqued for its focus on superficial content, particularly in the realms of television and newspapers. This obsession with the lives of famous individuals reflects a deeper cultural trend where appearance and gossip are prioritized over substantial discussions.Television shows and tabloids frequently revolve around celebrity lives, from their romantic escapades to fashion choices. This fixation serves a dual purpose: it entertains and, more importantly, draws in audiences seeking escapism. Media outlets understand that sensational stories about well-known personalities generate higher ratings and increased readership. Consequently, they often choose to sensationalize mundane aspects of celebrity life, creating a cycle of superficiality that prioritizes gossip over more meaningful content.The societal implications of this trend are significant. We live in a culture where image often carries more weight than substance. Social media platforms fuel this phenomenon by allowing users to curate and display idealized versions of their lives, further blurring the lines between what is real and what is merely a façade. In environments saturated with online influencers and reality television stars, the emphasis on appearance becomes so pronounced that critical issues such as politics, social justice, and economic inequities often take a backseat in public discourse.In conclusion, mass media’s preoccupation with superficial matters highlights a disturbing shift in priorities within our society. It encourages a culture that values appearance and gossip over deeper, more impactful narratives. As consumers of media, it is crucial to recognize this trend and seek out content that enriches rather than diminishes our understanding of the world. By doing so, we can contribute to a more informed and engaged society that values substance over style.
307;Which do you prefer: staying in one place or moving in search of another place?;Some people may prefer to live in different places at different time because of many reasons such as looking for better job, house, community and so on. I prefer to spend my entire live in one place which is my hometown. In my hometown, I have a lot of friends and good relationships, I love the traffic in here, and the environment is wonderful.I was born and grew up in here, a small town. In here, I have a lot of friends, and we usually spend free time to play sports like soccer, basketball and of course we have a lot of fun. Every people in my town have known each others, and we have good relationships. If anyone needs help, his neighbor will help as much as possible. Nowhere else can give me some people like in here.I want to live here because I love the traffic system in here. We have large streets but few cars, so we can move easily to anywhere. Last week, I went to the city center to meet my friends. The traffic in the city was too crowed. I have to wait for an hour to go to my friend house.I also love the environment in here. I have been gone to some places to travel and stay for a short time, and I realize that the environment in some place isn't clean and fresh like my home town. There were a lot of people so the environment can't be keep clean.In conclusion, I strongly feel that staying in one place is better than moving number of places. Moving some places can give to you a lot of experiences but living in one place like your hometown can make you feel comfortable about the traffic, people and of course the environment.;"Title: The Beauty of Roots: Embracing Life in My Small TownGrowing up in a small town has granted me a unique set of experiences and connections that I cherish deeply. Nestled among picturesque landscapes, my town is not just a place I inhabit; it is a tapestry of relationships, memories, and the comfort of familiarity. The bonds I’ve formed here are unlike any other, as they are rooted in shared experiences and a sense of community that is hard to find elsewhere. The friendships I have cultivated with my neighbors, schoolmates, and local business owners have provided me with a robust support system that has enriched my life immeasurably.One of the aspects I love most about my small town is the traffic—or rather, the lack of it. Unlike larger cities, the gentle ebb and flow of daily activity creates a serene environment that fosters relaxation and connection. Walking down the streets, I am greeted by familiar faces, friendly waves, and the enchanting sounds of nature surrounding me. This tranquil atmosphere allows me to appreciate the little things in life, from a stunning sunset to an impromptu gathering in the park. Furthermore, I strongly believe that staying in one place provides a grounding stability that constant movement lacks. In a world obsessed with migration and change, my roots here are a source of strength and security. Each day, I get to witness the seasons unfolding in my town, and each season brings its own charm and memories to cherish. I have learned that the love I have for this place transcends physical surroundings; it is about the connections, the stories, and the heartbeat of a community that welcomes me home. In conclusion, my small town is a sanctuary of relationships and environmental beauty that has shaped who I am. I find immense value in remaining here, surrounded by the comfort of familiarity and the warmth of friendship, rather than chasing after a constant change of scenery. In this haven, I feel truly alive."
308;Students at universities often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. Where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.Ê;When it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school, most students always get confused between these two options: living in an apartment, or in university dormitories. As far as I am concerned, both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university. For instance, students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club, or joining sports club. Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates. In addition, it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question, they can easily ask for help to their roommates, classmates, or teachers. I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students. On the other hand, living off campus prepares students for the real life. For example, students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible, independent, punctual, co-operative compared to living in university dormitories. They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time, and dealing with the utility bills. In addition, students also have to focus on their study, and try to maintain their grades higher. Furthermore, students also have a chance to know about the community around them. Interacting with the people, and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation. From given the evidences, it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits. If I have to choose, I would definitely choose the second option: living in an apartment. I think that it teaches me everything that I certainly wants to learn in my life because learning all those characteristics would really help me in leading successful life.;"Living in a university dormitory and off-campus each offers unique benefits that shape the student experience in significant ways. Dormitory life immerses students in the academic environment, enabling them to familiarize themselves with university culture. The proximity to professors, study groups, and campus events creates an atmosphere conducive to learning. Students living on-campus often find it easier to engage in academic activities, participate in discussions, and form study partnerships. The shared living experience fosters a sense of community, allows for instant collaboration, and helps students build enduring friendships, providing a supportive network during what can be a challenging transitional phase into higher education.On the other hand, living off-campus prepares students for the realities of life beyond the university walls. The independence of managing one’s own household instills crucial life skills that dorm living may not offer. Students take responsibility for budgeting, cooking, and maintaining their living space, which translates into vital lessons in accountability and self-sufficiency. Additionally, the experience of commuting may teach students the importance of punctuality and time management. Navigating daily responsibilities while balancing coursework can cultivate a sense of discipline and organizational skills.Moreover, living off-campus often requires more significant cooperation with roommates or neighbors, enhancing social skills and conflict resolution abilities. This prepares students for the collaborative environments they will encounter in the workforce. In essence, while dormitory life offers a focused academic community, off-campus living emphasizes real-world responsibilities and independence. Both experiences are invaluable in their own right; together, they equip students with a well-rounded foundation to thrive academically and personally, paving the way for successful futures."
309;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct.;Organizations, these days, seek to find people who can work extraordinary fast and carefully. These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company. Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal mentioned before. I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons. Trying to learn skills, working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice.To begin with, if persons work rapidly, they will have more chance to study. Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter. If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying, they can stares in their workplace. For example, I have a friend who was working so slowly. He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him. My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working.Most importantly, people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased. If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money. This fact pushes them to work faster and faster. For example, because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money, I am working in two organization to gain more salary. The more money, the more chances.Last but not least, people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks. If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly, your boss will assign you more tasks. If you do them fast too, the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder. It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation. Even if we ignore this result, by the same token, you can get higher position and more money.To sum up, I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky. Gaining more skills by study, having more than one job, and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages. I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice.;In today's fast-paced society, the dynamics of work and productivity are continually evolving. The notion of working fast, albeit at a certain level of risk, holds a significant place as individuals strive to achieve their ideal goals. With the cost of living steadily increasing, working quickly can potentially provide individuals with more opportunities to study or pursue additional interests, as they can generate income at a faster rate.The necessity to earn a living has led many individuals to juggle multiple jobs simultaneously—often two or three within a single week. This precarious balancing act serves as a response to rising expenses, as people are compelled to adapt to their financial environment. The increased workload can undeniably stretch the limits of an individual's capacity but also highlight the need for efficiency. By adopting a rapid work pace, individuals might find themselves with the flexibility to allocate time towards education or personal development, creating a beneficial cycle of learning and growth.However, there is a crucial caveat to this. Those who choose to work slowly may find themselves unable to accept more tasks and responsibilities, potentially limiting their career advancement and income opportunities. In contrast, the individuals who manage to work swiftly may encounter scenarios that require quick decision-making and adaptability, which, while risky, can also provide significant rewards in terms of experience and learning.Ultimately, striking a balance between speed and prudence is essential. Working too quickly can lead to errors and burnout, while working slowly can result in stagnation. To navigate this challenging landscape, individuals must assess their goals, work habits, and the risks involved, ensuring they remain on the path towards achieving their aspirations while managing the inevitable demands of modern life.
310;Do you agree or disagree: It is not necessary for university students to attend classes as long as they can pass the exam.;Though out the last decade, the load of the university students has been constantly increasing. There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam. There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam. However, from my perspective, students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam. The reasons to be illustrated are follows. Firstly, the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject. For example, I love Physics. But I don't like electronics, because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world. And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics. But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics. And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again. Luckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach. And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics. And at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam.Secondly, if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated. If one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes. And the students will have nothing to do in the campus. Then he or she will play online games days and nights. The academic achievement will decline. In the end, this student will become a loser in the world. And all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class. This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system.Admittedly, the university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not. But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points.All in all, the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated.;"In many educational systems, a common requirement is that university students must pass a foundational exam before they are allowed to attend classes. While this policy aims to ensure that students possess a baseline knowledge before diving deeper into their studies, I argue that it is not a necessary prerequisite for acquiring university-level knowledge. From my perspective, students can benefit from immersive learning experiences even if they have yet to pass such exams.Firstly, it is important to acknowledge that students are rarely experts in every facet of a subject when they enter university. Subjects are complex and multifaceted, and even the most capable students may have gaps in their understanding. By restricting access to classes based solely on exam performance, universities may inadvertently stifle a student’s opportunity for growth and exploration in areas where they initially lack proficiency. Learning is inherently a process; students often enhance their understanding through firsthand engagement with course material, discussions, and collaborative projects. Moreover, the traditional exam-driven approach can create undue stress and anxiety, potentially hindering a student’s ability to learn. An exam may not accurately reflect a student’s potential or dedication to a subject. When students are allowed to participate in classes regardless of their exam performance, they can develop critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and a deeper appreciation for the subject matter. Additionally, students who struggle initially may thrive in a supportive classroom environment, finding inspiration and motivation that transcends exam scores. The classroom experience fosters collaboration, mentorship, and diverse perspectives that cannot be replicated in a testing scenario alone. In conclusion, while exams serve a purpose in assessing knowledge, they should not determine access to educational opportunities. The university experience is an invaluable pathway for growth, and students can acquire significant knowledge by engaging in coursework without the need for preliminary testing."
311;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? To improve the quality of education, universities should spend more money in salaries for university professors.  Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University education is always an important part of one's life. That's why education in university is discussed all the time. What is the best way to orientate the students? Raising the salaries of professors so? I would say no. The professors are essential, however, the schools are established for students. Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors. The following are my opinions. To begin with, the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors. I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively. By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment. A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer. Thus, students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning. That is to say, students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve. Thus, the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation. In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby. For me, I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment. It's unpleasant to stay at school. However, coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly.Besides, the ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better. To improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate. In addition, will the university filter all the professors overall? Some professors don't deserve the money at all, then, what's the point to spend money on them? High-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money. There won't be any effect if school does so. There was news about raising professors' salary in my country. This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly. The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries. As you can see, if the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen. At school, students are priority. Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university. That's the main reason I against providing more money to professors. Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition.;University education plays a pivotal role in shaping individuals' futures and equipping them with the necessary skills to navigate the complexities of the modern world. As such, the orientation of students within this framework is critical. While increased salaries for professors may seem like a direct way to enhance educational quality, I argue that the primary focus should instead be on improving the facilities and resources available to students.Professors undoubtedly contribute significantly to the educational environment. Their expertise, mentorship, and guidance are invaluable to students' academic and personal growth. However, the overarching goal of universities is to foster an enriched learning experience for the students themselves. Investing funds into state-of-the-art facilities, such as libraries, laboratories, and study spaces, directly impacts students’ learning outcomes and overall university experience. Updated resources, including access to the latest technology, textbooks, and materials, are also vital for preparing students for the workforce and ensuring they are well-versed in current methodologies and practices.Moreover, enhancing facilities can cultivate a more collaborative and innovative atmosphere, encouraging students to work together, share ideas, and engage in hands-on learning experiences. For instance, modernized laboratories and collaborative workspaces can significantly improve the quality of education in fields that rely heavily on practical training. In conclusion, while professors are central to the academic ecosystem, the primary focus should be on enriching the student experience through improved facilities and resources. By prioritizing investment in these areas, universities can create an environment that not only supports professors but, more importantly, fosters student success and empowers the next generation of thinkers and innovators. In this way, a more effective orientation for students is established, ultimately benefiting society at large.
312;Pets should be treated like family members. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Pets have always been essential in our society. Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds, tortoises and fishes as well. Some people think that pets should be treated like family members. However, others argue that they are just animals and aren't able to think like us. The issue is controversial but in my opinion, pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons.First, pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are. Similarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone. We can talk to them because they listen to us, more than some people will ever do. To illustrate this point, I can write about my own experience. When I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important. Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way. Since I was all alone at home for a long time, my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings. Clearly, although pets aren't able to speak with us, we can nonetheless count on them.Secondly, pets are useful for a variety of things. For example, nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before. Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses. There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone. In addition, pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better. Moreover, there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs. To sum up, I am strongly convinced that pets deserve to be treated like family members because of all the reasons mentioned above, namely they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations.;"The debate surrounding the treatment of pets often divides opinions; some argue that pets should be treated as integral family members, while others maintain that they are merely animals that lack human-like cognitive abilities. However, it is essential to recognize the unique bond between humans and pets, which often transcends traditional pet-owner dynamics.First and foremost, pets offer companionship comparable to that of certain human relationships. They provide unconditional love and support that can sometimes be more profound than what we receive from our fellow humans. Animals, particularly dogs and cats, become attuned to our emotions, providing comfort during difficult times. Their empathetic nature creates a unique connection, as they listen to our thoughts and troubles without judgment. In a world where many people feel isolated, the companionship of pets can help fill that void, enabling a deeper sense of belonging.Moreover, the utility of pets extends beyond emotional support; they also contribute significantly to our well-being in various ways. The rise of pet therapy in recent years is a testament to this growing acknowledgment. Therapeutic interventions involving animals have been proven to alleviate stress, anxiety, and depression. In clinical settings, trained therapy animals assist patients in coping with medical conditions, enhancing their overall quality of life. As a result, recognizing pets as more than mere animals encourages a shift towards healthier, more fulfilling interactions.In conclusion, while some may argue that pets do not possess human-like thinking, their role in our lives suggests otherwise. The companionship they offer and the therapeutic benefits they provide emphasize the argument for treating them as family members. This perspective fosters greater empathy, understanding, and appreciation for the unique relationships we share with our beloved pets."
314;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Continuous technological and economical development in modern world created great differences between cities, a difference that is clearly visible in the size of various cities. From cities with more that 20 million people to small towns inhabited by only hundreds of people. This diversities in cities allowed for more difference in people's preferences for where to live. For me, I prefer to live in bigger cities than in small ones, this personal attitude is the result of many factors.First of all, I find the excitement of big cities to be attractive, living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one's personality and open one's eyes on the real world. Life in big cities cities gives one new challenges every day, let it be deciding which restaurant to go to or deciding which company to work for. For me, this lifestyles is very attractive and is considered a huge advantage of big cities compared with the constant, slow paced life styles of small towns.Another thing that put big cities in front of small towns is the facilitates and services it contains which support and improve the quality of its inhabitants' lives, hospitals, advanced medical facilities can satisfy one's need of medical safety. Cultural events such as exhibitions and theatre plays can enrich one's and widen his horizons, things which aren't offered by small towns.Furthermore, it's undeniable that the economic power of a country is driven by it's big cities and the majority of wealth and finance is centered and controlled in big cities. With this kind of power big cities offer more opportunities for one's career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does, and higher income can be the basis of a happier, healthier life.Finally, although I prefer to live in a big city, I can not help but assure that this is a matter of personal taste, to be clear, I would love to spend some days in countryside to recharge my soul and relieve myself from daily stress.;"Living in a larger city rather than a small town is a preference I have cultivated over the years, influenced by various factors. The excitement that big cities radiate captivates me. Cities like New York, London, and Tokyo are teeming with life, offering a kaleidoscope of experiences that inevitably enrich one's existence. The constant movement, diverse cultures, and a vast array of activities contribute to an environment where monotony is virtually absent. Being surrounded by such vibrancy inspires creativity and fosters a sense of adventure, making living in a big city a thrilling proposition.Moreover, the professional advancement opportunities available in larger cities are significantly greater than those typically found in small towns. Big cities are often economic hubs, boasting a multitude of industries and organizations. This abundance translates into increased job opportunities, allowing individuals to carve out successful careers. Networking is also more accessible; with countless events and gatherings taking place, one can connect with industry leaders and fellow professionals, fostering relationships that may lead to career advancements.In addition to the prospects for career growth, large urban centers often present better prospects for higher income. Major corporations are concentrated in cities, leading to competitive salaries that can make a substantial difference in one’s quality of life. Those living in cities have access to diverse employment options, allowing individuals to seek positions that align with their skills and aspirations. This financial stability allows for greater investment in personal goals and experiences, such as travel, education, and hobbies.In conclusion, my preference for living in larger cities stems from the unique excitement they offer and the vast opportunities for career growth and financial success that accompany urban life. These factors create a dynamic and fulfilling lifestyle that resonates with my aspirations and passions."
315;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homes.;"The housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays. And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years. The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important. What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction.Building more accommodating constructions meets people's basic need. People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in. If the price of housing grows continuously, a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class. Then, ordinary people, especially the younger generation, will fall into a certain pattern - work, pay bills for housing, work; and I am sure that it will increase people's dissatisfaction of the government. Because when they are working, the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers, which will limit their efficiency. And government should spend money on people to rescue them from this, because only a government of the people, by the people, for the people will finally last; people's cohesiveness will be promoted.Otherwise, another vital reason why new building construction deserves more governmental investment lies in the fact that it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation. Build a new building has following prerequisites, land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures, a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor. Except these, hundreds of problems would occur during the construction. Thus, only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness. Generally, personally speaking, I believe new building construction hold the right to gain more money from government.";In contemporary society, the government's priorities in urban planning and development must be aligned with the evolving needs of its citizens. While the preservation of historic and traditional buildings is often celebrated for its cultural significance, it should not overshadow the pressing necessity for new construction that accommodates the burgeoning population and their basic needs. Prioritizing new building construction is crucial for creating environments that foster a harmonious life for all individuals.First and foremost, the increasing population and urbanization necessitate the development of new housing. Many urban areas are grappling with significant shortages of affordable housing, leading to overcrowding and subpar living conditions. When governments focus primarily on preserving historic buildings, they may inadvertently neglect the urgent requirement for modern, safe, and approachable living spaces. A balanced approach must prioritize new construction that is designed to meet contemporary standards of comfort, safety, and accessibility.Additionally, suitable housing contributes directly to the well-being of citizens. People cannot lead harmonious lives when they lack decent living conditions. Deteriorating buildings often lead to increased health problems, social instability, and a decline in the overall quality of life. By investing in new, accommodating constructions, governments can ensure that every citizen has access to proper housing, thereby fostering a sense of community and stability.Moreover, prioritizing new construction does not inherently mean compromising on culture and history. Innovative architectural designs can incorporate elements of the past while meeting modern needs. Governments can encourage developers to blend the new with the old, thereby respecting and reflecting cultural heritage without sacrificing the fundamental goal of providing decent living conditions for citizens.In conclusion, while historic preservation holds value, a government’s foremost responsibility should be to ensure that all citizens have access to decent, accommodating housing. This focus will not only improve the quality of life for individuals but also contribute to the overall harmony and stability within communities.
316;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support our answer.;I agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future. My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled, improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life.The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood. Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking, eating, etc., but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life. For example, when they tried to learn walking, they stumble and hurt themselves many times. But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk.All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations. No known scientist has success in first attempt. Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want. It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb. So, all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through.Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly. We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time, but when we think back about those moments later in life, we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves. When I moved to college hostel after school, first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known. I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted, but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them. I also became more casual and social with others, this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills. Therefore, to conclude my opinion on this statement, I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life. Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life.;Life is often perceived as a series of challenges and obstacles, and it is during these tough moments that we may feel overwhelmed and defeated. However, I firmly believe that these difficult experiences serve as vital lessons that shape our future selves. The trials we encounter not only enhance our skills but also refine our decision-making abilities, ultimately cultivating resilience that we may not even realize we possess.One of the most significant advantages of navigating through tough experiences is the development of skills. Each challenge we face requires us to adapt and find solutions, often pushing us outside of our comfort zones. For instance, a student struggling with a subject may seek additional help, leading to improved study habits and a deeper understanding of the material. Similarly, individuals facing adversity in their careers may learn new skills or ways of thinking to overcome obstacles, ultimately leading to professional growth. The skills honed during these times can become invaluable assets that we carry with us throughout our lives.Moreover, overcoming adversity unknowingly strengthens us. Each challenge faced makes us more robust, preparing us for future difficulties. Through adversity, we learn valuable lessons about determination and perseverance. When we emerge from these experiences, we possess a newfound strength that empowers us to tackle future challenges with confidence. It is often the most difficult times that reveal our true character, instilling qualities such as empathy, patience, and tenacity.In conclusion, while life may seem tough at times, the experiences that challenge us are essential for our growth. They enhance our skills, improve our decision-making, and unknowingly forge resilience within us. By embracing these difficult moments, we lay the foundation for a promising future, equipped with the lessons and strengths derived from our challenges. Thus, it is crucial to view tough experiences not merely as obstacles but as transformative opportunities for personal development.
317;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Drivers have to pay a fee for driving in busy city streets when there is a great amount of traffic.;"Started in the late eighteenth century, the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles. The very fuel that they rely on, oil, has now become the dominant pollution of cities' environment. While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts, I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them. The reasons are the followings. Capitalism enfranchised people's right to own properties, and consequently, their rights to use them. Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities's environment, but laws protect drivers to do so, and accordingly, charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction. From another point of view, traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban; so it is out of drivers' control. Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time? Wars are notorious, but you can't blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries.Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear. Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous. Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance, and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights.Rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee, government should instead, be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil. Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light, or unreasonable organization of roadways. In these cases, the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner, not drivers. Simply put, charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful. In conclusion, ""rush hours"" are usually not the direct consequence of drivers. Instead, the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds, and therefore, charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational.";The debate surrounding the exorbitant use of oil and the proposal to charge drivers extra fees during rush hour has garnered significant attention. Critics argue that the excessive consumption of oil heavily contributes to environmental degradation and urban gridlock. They advocate for disincentives, such as increased fees during peak times, to discourage selfish driving behavior and promote public transportation alternatives. While I appreciate the environmental concerns these critics raise, I contend that imposing additional payments on drivers is not a fair or practical solution.Firstly, traffic congestion is often an unavoidable aspect of modern urban living. A multitude of factors contribute to this phenomenon—population growth, urban development, and the limitations of existing road infrastructure. Many drivers find themselves stuck in traffic due to circumstances beyond their control, such as accidents, roadwork, or simply the sheer volume of cars on the road. Penalizing drivers with extra fees for these situations seems unjust, as individuals are frequently left with no alternative but to navigate the crowded streets.Moreover, charging drivers extra during rush hours could disproportionately affect low- and middle-income individuals who may rely on their vehicles for commuting to work. This additional financial burden may force them into difficult choices, such as sacrificing job opportunities located far from public transportation. If we aim to create an equitable solution to urban traffic issues, fostering access rather than imposing restrictions should be a priority.Instead of levying extra charges, we should invest in improving public transportation options, enhancing road infrastructure, and promoting carpooling initiatives. By addressing the root causes of traffic congestion, we can create a more sustainable urban environment without unfairly penalizing those caught in its chaotic grasp. Ultimately, understanding and accommodating the complexities of urban traffic is far more constructive than imposing additional financial burdens on individuals.
318;Agree or disagree: one of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;"Nowadays, the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger. If students want to get used to the society quickly, it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs. There are some reasons can support my view.First, there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university. Because most people they contact with are also students. However, when students do part-time jobs, they can work with many kinds of people, and most of whom are adults. So, they can teach students many things about adult life. My friend Lisa, who is doing part-time job now, tells me that it is fabulous to take it. Through part-time job, she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life. For example, Lisa thought in adult life, work is the core; but after she knows these friends, she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work. Hence, thanks to the information her new friends has provided; now she is more confidence about her future adult life. Second, parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life. However, because we do not experience it, it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be. Therefore, we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be. Actually, some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs, they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job. Therefore, the part-time job can make people understand future life better.Third, some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student' study. Actually, most students will do the part-time job in their holiday, so it will not effect on their study. Compared with playing computers every day, doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday.In conclusion, taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it. Therefore, parents should encourage students to take the part-time job.";The transition from the sheltered environment of school to the responsibilities of adult life can be daunting for many students. While parents often emphasize the heightened stress and challenges of adulthood compared to the relatively carefree days of school, it can be difficult for students to fully grasp the reality of this statement without firsthand experience. Participating in a part-time job during holidays offers an invaluable opportunity for students to engage with the responsibilities and realities of adult life, bridging the gap between theory and practice.A part-time job exposes students to a range of experiences that school simply cannot provide. From managing time effectively to balancing work commitments with personal life, students learn crucial skills that will serve them well in the future. They gain insights into workplace dynamics, experience the importance of teamwork, and develop a sense of responsibility as they navigate the expectations of employers. This newfound understanding can deepen their appreciation for the nuanced challenges adults face daily.In contrast, dedicating time to passive activities such as playing video games can foster a disconnect from reality. Although gaming can be enjoyable and even educational, it does not cultivate the practical skills or life lessons that come from engaging in real-world tasks. By choosing to work part-time instead of spending hours in front of a screen, students not only occupy their time meaningfully but also develop a stronger work ethic and a sense of independence.In conclusion, while the prospect of adult life may seem intimidating, part-time jobs provide a structured and constructive way for students to gain firsthand experience. These opportunities enrich their understanding of adult responsibilities and societal expectations, ultimately equipping them with essential skills to navigate the complexities of life beyond the classroom. Embracing part-time work during holidays can undoubtedly be one of the most beneficial decisions students make for their future.
319;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Study achievements depend on a range of various factors, one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying. In particular, we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone. As for me, I favor the latter because of the following reasons.To begin with, type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one. Being by nature introvert, I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people. Once, when I was working on presentation with strangers, I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people. Therefore, my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper.Furthermore/moreover, working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork. In other words, I must not divide tasks and duties between team members, share responsibility and benefits, and spend time on teambuilding. These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time. About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game. To my rivals' surprise, being the only member of my own ""team"" I gained a victory.In conclusion, from my point of view, type of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone.";Study achievements are influenced by a multitude of factors, including the methods of work students choose to adopt during their studies. Personally, I gravitate towards individual work rather than collaborative team settings, and there are several reasons for this preference.To begin with, my temperament significantly influences my choice of study patterns. As someone who tends to be introspective and self-reliant, I often find that I thrive when working independently. This temperament allows me to immerse myself in tasks without the distractions that can accompany group dynamics. In individual study environments, I am able to focus deeply on the material at hand, thus facilitating a greater understanding and retention of information.Moreover, individual work allows for a customizable approach tailored to my personal learning style. I can set my own pace, choosing when to delve deeper into complex concepts or when to take breaks as needed. This flexibility is a vital element of effective studying, as it accommodates my unique preferences and helps maintain my motivation. In contrast, team work often involves compromises in terms of schedules and priorities, which can lead to frustration and reduced productivity.Additionally, studying alone fosters a sense of accountability and self-discipline. When I work individually, the responsibility for achieving outcomes rests squarely on my shoulders, compelling me to push myself harder and maintain a high standard of work. This self-motivation has significantly contributed to the successes I have experienced in my academic journey.In conclusion, my preference for individual study over teamwork stems predominantly from my temperament, the adaptability of my learning methods, and the intrinsic motivation it fosters. I believe that understanding one’s own study patterns can lead to more effective and rewarding academic experiences.
320;Some people prefer to work for themselves or own a business. Others prefer to work for an employer. Would you rather be self-employed, work for someone else, or own a business? Use specific reasons to explain your choice.;Most people want to work for an employer, because they want to feel secure about their salary, or feel comfortable about other problems of having own job such as paying tax, worrying about selling, etc. Despite these problems, personally, I would prefer to have my own job. My arguments are listed as follows. First, time is the more valuable thing, which I have in my life. By having my own business, I can manage my own time. I could work whenever I want, or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay. I can arrange time to travel when I would like. In addition, I can work long hours for earning more money. Totally, the most important reason for me to be self-employed is the sense of free. Moreover, earning money is the fundamental reason that why people work. The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job. If I work for other people, I have to give my ideas to employers cheaply. Therefore, I never have been rich in my life, because my salary is not dramatically changed. In spite of many problems of having own business, I can earn more money based on my creativity and personal ideas. To sum up, in spite of the fact that many people are not eager to work for themselves, I would like to run my own business to control my own time, and to earn more money based on my noble ideas.;In today’s fast-paced world, the quest for personal fulfillment and financial security often leads individuals to weigh the pros and cons of employment. Despite the myriad problems associated with work, such as stress and long hours, I firmly believe that having my own job is preferable for several compelling reasons.First and foremost, time is the most valuable commodity in our lives. When I consider my future, I prioritize how I spend my time and the freedom that comes with being my own boss. A job offers structure, but it also provides an opportunity to manage my schedule in a way that aligns with my values, passions, and personal goals. Having control over my time means I can dedicate hours to not only work but also pursue hobbies, spend time with loved ones, and maintain a healthy work-life balance. This autonomy is invaluable and cannot be underestimated.Secondly, the fundamental reason people work is to earn money. The financial aspects of a job often take precedence in decision-making. In our society, the amount of money earned is a crucial criterion for choosing a job. A steady income generates stability and opens doors to opportunities, allowing individuals to invest in their future and enjoy a comfortable lifestyle. By having my own job, I can set my own rates, build my clientele, and potentially earn more than I would in a traditional employment setting. This financial independence is not just a means to survive, but a stepping stone to achieve long-term dreams and aspirations.In conclusion, despite the challenges that come with having a job, the freedom to manage my own time and the financial benefits it provides make it an appealing choice. The desire for autonomy and financial stability are powerful motivators that influence my preference for having my own job.
321;Should a city try to preserve its old, historic buildings or destroy them and replace them with modern buildings? use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones, but these revolutions should not include historic buildings. The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors. In addition, they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists. Historic buildings answer many questions, which are mysterious about our previous ancestors; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings. They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city. They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago. They show us how they survive, or how they defend themselves etc. By investigating about their structures, we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building. In the other hand, historic buildings are important treasures, which provide an area to learn valuable lessons. Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city. It is interesting for most people to know about the way people live in thousands years ago. Therefore, It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors. Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on. These are reasons that why we should preserve historic buildings in the city. They can benefit us financially by developing other industries. Moreover, they are the symbols of our nations, which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors.";Historic buildings are invaluable treasures that not only enrich our cultural landscape but also serve as vital educational resources. These structures provide insight into the lifestyles, values, and social norms of the people who lived thousands of years ago. By preserving the architectural styles and materials from different eras, they paint a vivid picture of humanity’s journey through time. For instance, ancient temples and castles reveal the religious practices, governance, and artistry of past civilizations, allowing us to appreciate their innovations and challenges.Moreover, historic buildings play a crucial role in spatial memory, reminding us of our collective heritage. They foster a sense of identity and continuity, connecting present generations with their ancestry. Visiting such sites often sparks curiosity, prompting individuals to explore history in greater depth, thus cultivating a more informed and engaged society. Educational programs and guided tours often accompany historic sites, allowing visitors, especially students, to glean knowledge about the intricate narratives that underpin these structures.In addition to their educational significance, historic buildings can serve as powerful drivers of tourism industries. Well-preserved landmarks attract tourists seeking authentic experiences, significantly boosting local economies. The influx of visitors can lead to the development of related services such as hotels, restaurants, and cultural activities, further enhancing economic growth. Cities renowned for their historical architecture often see sustained tourist interest, which helps fund maintenance, preservation, and restoration projects, ensuring these treasures endure for future generations.In conclusion, historic buildings are essential not only for the lessons they impart about the past but also for their potential to stimulate local economies through tourism. By embracing and preserving these structures, we safeguard our history and provide opportunities for learning and growth, ensuring that the stories of those who came before us continue to resonate in our modern world.
322;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Learning is a thing that we do in all of our lives. Getting the best lessons, besides our abilities to self-study, depends on our teachers a lot. There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers. I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons.Firstly, parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life. As we were born, parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile, how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating. Moreover, when we grow bigger, they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives.Secondly, at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages, but after school we learn from our parents. In my opinion, we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school. I think when we leave school, maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life, but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day. For example, I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me.Thirdly, I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally. Therefore, even when we grow older, get married and then have our own families with spouses and children, parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life. For instance, my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life, he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice.To conclude, I strongly believe that parents are our best teachers.;"The role of parents as our first teachers is often underestimated in a world that tends to glorify formal education. From the moment we are born, our parents become our primary educators, guiding us through the fundamental stages of life. They teach us essential skills, from smiling as infants to taking our first steps. These early lessons are crucial; they lay the groundwork for our social interactions and physical independence.As we grow older, the teaching from our parents evolves. They instill vital ethical principles and values that shape our character and influence our decisions throughout life. Lessons on honesty, respect, responsibility, and empathy often originate within the familial setting. The importance of these teachings cannot be overstated; they mold us into the individuals we become. The experiences shared within the family unit contribute significantly to our emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills, which are invaluable as we navigate the complexities of the world.Moreover, it is important to recognize the amount of time we spend at home compared to school. For many, a majority of the formative years are spent surrounded by family. This environment is where we not only learn practical skills but also develop our identities. While teachers in schools play a crucial role in academic education, they often do not spend as much time with us as our parents do. The lessons learned at home tend to resonate more deeply, as they are rooted in love and support.In conclusion, while formal education is undeniably important, the education provided by parents is foundational and lasting. Their role as teachers is omnipresent and vital, shaping us in ways that echo throughout our lives. Thus, recognizing and appreciating the contributions of parents as our first and most significant teachers is essential in understanding our personal and social development."
324;Do you agree or disagree with the statement, in order to succed in doing a new job, the ability to adapt oneself in a new environment is more important than excellent knowledge of this job.;With the rapid development of economy, the controversial of good worker's requirement is always in a limelight. A large number of people will say the ability to adapt oneself to a new environment is necessary, because it is the basic communication skill for a new worker. From my perspective, there is only one thing would be beneficial to company, and there is only one way to be an outstanding worker, that is possessing excellent knowledge of this job. That's why I believe that the excellent knowledge of this job will be more significant.Admittedly, the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job. This ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates, cooperating with other workers needs this ability, too. But working alone is a longer-term job than communicating, that is, the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker, but the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave. The company will benefit from every worker of excellent knowledge. The core and most profitable technology of an IT company is invented by a worker with excellent computer knowledge, not a worker with outstanding communicating skill. The high reputation and popularity of a company is earned by some brilliant workers in public relation department with excellent skill to propagate this company. So the company will earn more money and reputation from these workers with excellent knowledge. Employees will obtain reward from hard-work pursuing excellent knowledge. Through our whole study life, undergraduate and graduate, we keep learning with the purpose of exerting these knowledge and experience on our job, just like an old Chinese scholar said, the essence of study is utilizing it. After we get a job, the destination of we keep accumulating and collecting knowledge is rooted not in fawn on our manager with the ability to adapt this kind of business culture, but in making us excellent and totally master this job. Finally, we will be rewarded with pride. That's why we can obtain reward from out excellent knowledge.To sum up, I would have to say that although we can use the ability of adapting oneself in a new environment, the excellent knowledge will be of more importance. Because it can not only benefit our employers, but also ourselves will be rewarded.;The ability to adapt to new environments is increasingly recognized as a crucial skill in the modern workplace. In an era characterized by rapid technological advancements and evolving business dynamics, employees are often required to navigate through diverse teams, changing processes, and varying corporate cultures. Flexibility and adaptability empower workers to thrive in these fluctuating circumstances, making them invaluable assets to their organizations. However, while adaptability is essential, it is not the only skill that contributes to workplace effectiveness.Working alone, though often necessary, has its limitations when it comes to fostering long-term success and collaboration. Job roles may require solitary tasks, yet the real value lies in teamwork and communication. While an individual’s ability to execute tasks independently is important, enhanced productivity and innovation typically arise from collaborative efforts. Workplace dynamics flourish when workers share ideas, develop solutions collectively, and leverage each other's strengths. Ultimately, it is the synergy of diverse perspectives that cultivates a more dynamic workforce.Moreover, possessing excellent knowledge and expertise in a field benefits not just the individual but the entire organization. Employees who are well-versed in their areas of specialization bring unique insights and problem-solving abilities, which can propel the company forward. Their proficiency can lead to improved efficiency, better decision-making, and innovative strategies, all of which contribute to achieving organizational goals. When each employee demonstrates a commitment to excellence and knowledge sharing, the company reaps the rewards through enhanced performance and a competitive edge in the market.In conclusion, adaptability and knowledge are both indispensable components of a successful career. While the ability to adjust to new circumstances is crucial for immediate challenges, building strong communication and collaboration skills can foster a healthier work environment that benefits both employees and organizations in the long run. Emphasizing a culture of continuous learning and teamwork not only enhances individual careers but can also propel the company to greater heights.
325;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Computers have revolutionized our lifestyle during last century. However, some people especially young ones use computers extremely and this excessive usage lead to increase stress among them, but computers have brought many advantages to our lives. From my point of view, computers have an important and inevitable role in economic, business, and other part of societies. In addition, they make the way of living easier by doing our routine duties. Admittedly, by using computers in many industries human's role has been reduced. Nowadays, computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries, which were early done by human. Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks, which were carried out by human early. For example, many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots, which are controlled by computers. In addition, car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers. Despite many advantages, by coming computers many jobs has been vanished. A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers. Computers have an important role in social and personal life. Computers have opened up a network connection among people. This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message. Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers. Moreover, People can use computers to extract their essential information easily. By contrast, excessive use of computers has brought many difficulties. The results show that teenagers who are addicted to computer games show more violent and stressful behaviors. People who have type by computers may suffer from such disease related to knees. By considering all reasons, advantages of computers outweigh disadvantages. People benefit more from coming computers into their lives. In addition, computers can do most difficult tasks which leads to make life easier.;In the contemporary world, computers have assumed an indispensable role in various sectors, including economics, business, and broader societal functions. Their integration into daily operations has revolutionized the way industries operate, driving efficiency and productivity to unprecedented levels. The rise of automation, powered by computer technology, has allowed businesses to streamline processes and minimize errors, resulting in significant cost savings and enhanced output.However, this technological progress comes with its own set of challenges. One of the most profound impacts has been the diminishing role of humans in the workforce. As industries adopt more advanced computer systems, tasks that once required human intervention are increasingly handled by machines. From manufacturing to customer service, automation has rendered many traditional jobs obsolete. For instance, assembly line workers, bookkeepers, and even cashiers have faced redundancy as computers and robotic systems take over their responsibilities. Despite the clear benefits of increased efficiency and the potential for economic growth, the elimination of jobs raises critical concerns about employment and income stability. The displacement of workers can lead to significant societal issues, including rising unemployment rates and economic inequality. As certain sectors undergo rapid transformation, there is a pressing need for reskilling and upskilling initiatives to prepare workers for new roles in a tech-driven landscape. In conclusion, while computers play an essential and inevitable role in advancing economic and social frameworks, it is crucial to acknowledge and address the job displacement that accompanies this shift. The challenge lies in finding a balance between embracing technological innovation and ensuring that the workforce is equipped for the future. Navigating this transition effectively will be key to fostering a robust economy that benefits all members of society.
326;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?Children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.;Learning a foreign language is necessary for children to strengthen their ability to learn. Whether children should start learning a foreign language as they start school or not might be a controversial issue. It seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school. Learning that not only help them to improve their minds and memories, but can extend their visions about the other countries. First, the ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life. Thereby students in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language. They can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies. It is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives. By considering this and being aware of that students have not any responsibility and other difficulty in comparison with a young man, we can infer that why this time is the best time to learn any language.In addition, Learning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World. They would be able to understand other cultures and costumes. Moreover, It can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World. Having knowledge about other countries and their languages lead to extend the child's vision. Therefore, they would be able to develop their personalities and sense of reliance. Overall, it is easy to distinguish between a child having two languages and a child having just his native language while comparing their ability to communicate, understanding other studies, etc, to find that why children should start learning a foreign language in the beginning of the education.;Learning a foreign language is an invaluable asset for children, fundamentally strengthening their cognitive abilities and broadening their perspectives. In an increasingly interconnected world, the capacity to communicate in another language fosters not only better educational outcomes but also enhances personal growth.First and foremost, the cognitive benefits of bilingualism are profound. Research indicates that learning a foreign language engages children’s brains in unique ways, improving their memory, problem-solving skills, and overall intelligence. As children navigate the complexities of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation in a new language, they develop more robust mental processes. This mental agility often translates to improved performance in other academic subjects, reinforcing the idea that language learning is not merely a supplementary activity, but an essential part of a well-rounded education.Moreover, exposure to foreign languages allows children to develop a deeper understanding of different cultures. Language is intrinsically tied to culture, and learning a new language opens doors to exploring diverse traditions, values, and ways of life. This cultural immersion cultivates empathy and appreciation for others, essential qualities in today’s global society. As children learn about customs, history, and social norms from other countries, they develop a more nuanced worldview, encouraging them to become more open-minded individuals.In a globalized society, the ability to speak more than one language is increasingly important. It enhances communication skills and lays the foundation for future opportunities in education, travel, and career prospects. Learning a foreign language not only equips children with practical skills but also imbues them with the confidence to engage with a world that is rich in diversity.In conclusion, the pursuit of foreign language proficiency during childhood is not just about learning to communicate differently. It is a crucial endeavor that sharpens mental faculties, fosters cultural awareness, and prepares young learners for an interconnected world. As such, encouraging language learning in children is a vital investment in their future.
327;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Boys and girls should attend separate schools. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Women or men almost need each other in full of life even in school. Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education, others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender. In my opinion, boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex. School is a small society for students, which prepares them for the future life. By attending to the same school, students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate. In addition, a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa. They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study, how communicate with girls in a group, etc. Admittedly, when they study together and help each other, they exercise the the real life as they age. By contrast, some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them. By doing this, outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship and as result, their thoughts deviate from the studies. Moreover, attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better. Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class, therefore they will study increasingly. Indeed, Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa. As a result, the productivity of the class will be increased. In a word, attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages. Taking part in the study groups would increase student's motivation to study more. In addition, they would be able to know the opposite gender, which help them to be prepared for the adult life where they almost will live or work together.;The debate surrounding co-educational versus single-sex schooling has garnered significant attention in recent years. While some experts argue that attending mixed-gender schools presents many disadvantages, I firmly believe that boys and girls should study together. This interaction not only fosters mutual respect and understanding but also equips students with the essential skills needed to navigate the complexities of social relationships.First and foremost, studying alongside peers of the opposite sex provides an invaluable opportunity for boys and girls to understand each other better. Regular interaction in an academic setting encourages communication and collaboration, helping to break down stereotypes and societal expectations. As boys learn how to express themselves to girls, they also develop empathy and confidence. Conversely, girls gain insights into male perspectives, cultivating a more rounded understanding of their counterparts. This foundation is crucial, as the ability to converse and collaborate effectively with the opposite sex is a skill that extends far beyond the classroom, benefiting personal relationships and professional environments.Moreover, co-educational settings prepare students for real-world scenarios where they must engage with individuals of different genders. The dynamics of the workplace, social functions, and community events often require effective communication between men and women. By fostering these skills during formative years, students are likely to feel more comfortable in various social situations throughout their lives. This preparation is particularly pertinent in a society that increasingly values inclusivity and collaboration.While some argue that mixed-gender schooling can lead to distractions and social tensions, I contend that these challenges can be mitigated through open dialogues and educational programs that emphasize respect and equality. By learning to engage with one another in a supportive environment, boys and girls can grow together, ultimately enriching their educational experiences and personal development. Thus, the potential benefits of co-education significantly outweigh the disadvantages, making it an essential aspect of modern schooling.
328;Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. In your opinion, what does success come from? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. ;"""The biggest risk is not taking any risk."" The ones who have a big dream, they need to be brave and dare to live new situations. It is not guaranteed that you are going to achieve your dream if you had planned carefully as the same way when you take risks, but it is more frustrating if you had made plans and then it went wrong. Therefore, it is essential to take chances and believe this is going to work out. Assuming new opportunities is indispensable to have diverse experiences. In fact, life may not be easy; it will have various challenges especially when you take risks, but in the end, it can be surprisingly wonderful. For instance, some people abandon their job, family and friends and go to other country without knowing what the future holds for them. In the beginning, it can be tough to fit in this new place and find any opportunity, but after fighting against the obstacles blocking the way to get what is desired; it is possible to conquer what they are craving as well as start to build a new life in this other country. In fact, many people are afraid to take risks and fail. It is possible to get frustrate along the way, but it is vital to never give up on your dream. To illustrate, Walt Disney, whose career is famous, had a challenging life. One of the difficulties was some of his histories, such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs, were turned down. He heard lots of ""no"", furthermore one editor fired him alleging that he had no imagination, after all what he had gone through, he never stop chasing his dreams. To conclude, in this competitive world you have to be fearless and face all new situations. Even though sometimes you consider backing down and stay in the same routine that you are used to, it is necessary to have courage to take risks, be different and pursue your dream to have a successful life.";"""The biggest risk is not taking any risk,"" famously attributed to Aristotle, encapsulates a profound truth about the human experience. In a world brimming with opportunities and challenges, the fear of failure often paralyzes individuals, leading them to cling to the safety of the familiar instead of pursuing their dreams. Yet, it is crucial to understand that stagnation can inhibit growth and prevent personal fulfillment. Embracing risk, however daunting, is necessary for achieving one's aspirations.One vivid example of this principle can be seen in the life of Walt Disney, a man synonymous with creativity and innovation. Despite his monumental success, Disney's journey was fraught with setbacks and challenges. Early in his career, he faced rejection from a newspaper for lacking creativity and even experienced bankruptcy with his first animation studio. These failures could have easily discouraged him from continuing to pursue his passion for animation and storytelling. Yet, Disney persevered, believing in his vision and the unique magic he could create.Through relentless hard work, determination, and a willingness to take risks, Disney eventually transformed the entertainment industry. His unwavering belief in the power of imagination led to the creation of iconic characters and the establishment of Disneyland, a testament to the rewards that can arise from daring to take risks. Disney’s legacy reminds us that the path to success is rarely linear and often involves confronting fear and uncertainty.In conclusion, the fear of failure should never deter individuals from chasing their dreams. Walt Disney's life exemplifies the rewards of embracing risk, demonstrating that even the greatest achievements often emerge from the ashes of initial setbacks. The greatest risk lies in remaining inactive; only by taking bold steps can one carve their unique path to success."
329;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"People should sometimes do things, even though they don't enjoy it. This is basic part of the lives. There may be small or big things, but at last people should accept them, because most of them is about responsibilities. Moreover, sometimes by doing things helps the people learn about live. In this essay, the reasons for why I agree that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing will be explored. Firstly, most people's lives are filled with tasks that they don't enjoy doing.In personal live, we have some responsibilities towards to other people, there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities. For instance, housework is very difficult for me, although my husband helps me some of them, but it is my responsibility. I really don't like any of them, however I should do. Secondly,professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs. Nobody likes attending boring conferences, or working a person who isn't well in with anyone. I'm a research asistant at a university, and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn't good at human relationships, most of the asistans don't enjoy to talk with him about any situation, although we have to ask about his field. Thirdly, doing something which an individual doesn't enjoy can led to enjoyment. People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don't really want. For example, one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don't like. After insisting on some of our friends, we attended, and got really enjoyable time, we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month.Nobody has a life with a lot of fun; there are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone, but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual's live.";In life, we often face situations where we must engage in activities we do not particularly enjoy. While it may seem counterintuitive, these experiences are fundamental to personal growth and professional development. Embracing the discomfort of unwelcome tasks can cultivate resilience and foster essential skills that benefit us in the long run.In our professional lives, we inevitably encounter tasks that are intrinsic to our roles, regardless of our preferences. For instance, attending tedious conferences or collaborating with colleagues whose personalities clash with ours are common occurrences. While these tasks may seem monotonous or challenging, they are vital for networking, gaining knowledge, and honing our interpersonal skills. Discomfort can serve as a catalyst for improvement, pushing us to develop patience, adaptability, and communication skills that are crucial in a multifaceted work environment.Moreover, engaging in these less enjoyable activities may inadvertently lead to newfound enjoyment. By stepping outside our comfort zones, we expose ourselves to varied perspectives and experiences that could ignite unexpected interests. For example, attending a seemingly dull seminar might inspire a passion for a new subject or a deeper understanding of our field. Similarly, working alongside a difficult colleague can teach us valuable lessons in conflict resolution and collaboration, ultimately enhancing our professional relationships and work atmosphere.In conclusion, while the idea of participating in activities we do not enjoy can be daunting, it is essential to recognize their importance in our lives. These experiences are an inherent aspect of personal and professional growth, shaping us into well-rounded individuals. Embracing discomfort allows us not only to fulfill necessary obligations but also to discover new interests and possibilities, transforming potential drudgery into valuable stepping stones on our journey through life.
331;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of the solutions do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;As young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own. But, the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one. Personally, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time.Living on your own is a huge financial commitment. At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job, so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself. So, I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income.Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them. Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life. Living together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents. Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents.While some critics may argue that, young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want. However, I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have. It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night, smoke or do drugs. In a nutshell, I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own. It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs. Thus, to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life, to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path, it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time.;The transition from adolescence to adulthood is marked by significant changes in responsibilities, expectations, and living arrangements. Young adults often crave independence and the freedom that comes with living on their own. However, the question of the appropriate age for them to leave their parents is a contentious issue. Many advocate for early independence, arguing that it fosters personal growth and responsibility. Yet, I believe that young adults should consider living with their parents for a longer period before stepping into full independence.Choosing to remain at home longer can provide substantial benefits. Firstly, it allows young adults to save money, which is crucial in today’s economic climate, where the costs of housing and living expenses are consistently rising. By living with their parents, young adults have the opportunity to pay off student loans, save for emergencies, or even contribute financially to household expenses, thereby alleviating some financial pressure on their parents. This not only builds financial stability for the young adult but can also strengthen the family unit.Moreover, living at home fosters a supportive environment where young adults can continue to develop essential life skills. These years can be seen as a transitional phase where they can learn budgeting, cooking, and managing daily responsibilities without the high stakes often associated with living alone. It also offers a chance to build emotional maturity in a safe space, where they can navigate challenges with guidance from their parents.In conclusion, while the desire for independence is natural for young adults, staying at home longer can provide vital advantages. It cultivates financial stability, emotional growth, and practical life skills that prepare them for future challenges. Thus, instead of rushing into the world on their own, young adults should embrace the benefits of a more extended period living with their parents.
332;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development.;Nowadays, the Earth has become like a small village. In the course of the last hundred years, the way majority of people communicate with each other has been altered significantly because of technology. But there are vast amount of disputes whether it is positive or negative. From my point of view, this development was a very positive one in spite of its some drawbacks.To begin with, nowadays, to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever. Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present, it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete. By means of some software such as Skype, MSN, Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want. For example, in earlier times, people didn't leave for faraway places, because they could easily get lost. This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive.Further, by means of some communication tools, it has become very easy to make new friends. According to statistics, 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet. In this sense, Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends.However, the other side of the coin is that, by communicating via Internet or phone, we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully, because during such conversations, some of our words can make a completely different sense. As a result, the rate of divorces is increasing day by day. By way of conclusion, I once again restate my position that the development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people very positively by making it easier and more comfortable.;Over the last century, the landscape of human communication has been dramatically reshaped by technological advancements. This paradigm shift has transformed how we connect, converse, and share experiences, enabling us to forge relationships that transcend geographical boundaries. From my perspective, this development has been overwhelmingly positive, even though it comes with some drawbacks.One of the most significant changes has been the ease with which we can maintain relationships with loved ones who live far away. In the past, long-distance communication often relied on letters or expensive phone calls, which could take weeks or even months for a response. Today, technology allows us to instantly connect through various platforms, including emails, social media, and video calls. This immediacy fosters a sense of closeness that was once unattainable, allowing families and friends to engage in real time, regardless of the distance that separates them.Moreover, technology has also enriched our communication by introducing new forms of interaction. The rise of social media has created virtual communities where individuals can share life updates, exchange ideas, and support one another. Online platforms enhance our social networks, enabling us to connect with people who share similar interests, backgrounds, and experiences. This global exchange of ideas fosters empathy, understanding, and cultural appreciation.However, it is essential to recognize that these advancements are not without their challenges. The pervasive nature of digital communication can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or a lack of authentic connection, as non-verbal cues are often lost in virtual exchanges. Additionally, the prevalence of social media can contribute to feelings of isolation or inadequacy when comparing ourselves to curated online personas.In conclusion, while technology has undeniably transformed the way we communicate, the positives far outweigh the negatives. The ability to connect with loved ones effortlessly, coupled with the opportunity to engage with diverse perspectives from around the world, exemplifies the progress we have made in human interaction. Embracing these technological advances allows us to cultivate deeper connections and expand our horizons, ultimately enriching our lives.
333;With the increasing use and development of new technology, many machines are now able to do the work which people used to perform. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?;The issue of whether using of machine are bring many advantages to society is of great concern to many people. In my opinion, although using machines have many benefits, we cannot ignore its negative effects.It is undoubted that machines can bring many benefits. For one thing, machines are more effective than human. Not like human, machines do not need rest, which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes. For another, using machines can save company's money. Because machines never ask for salary, over-time pay or pension, so employers do not need to spend money on employee's welfare. The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working. However, the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people. To start with, because of extensive of using machines, many people loss their job. Especially in large population countries, high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability. Apart from this, using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation. For example, nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing. But they did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware. As you can imagine, if thousands of families use dish-washing machines, how many water and how much electricity will be wasted!In conclusion, although we cannot deny machines are play a vital role in people living and working, problems posed by machines should draws more attentions as well.;Machines have become an integral part of modern society, delivering numerous benefits that enhance productivity and efficiency across various industries. One of the most significant advantages of machines over human labor is their capacity for effectiveness and consistency. Unlike humans, who require rest, breaks, and downtime, machines can operate continuously, providing an uninterrupted flow of work. This capability allows employers to maximize output and meet demand without the limitations imposed by human fatigue.Moreover, machines are designed to execute tasks with precision. In manufacturing, for instance, automated assembly lines are capable of producing high-quality products at a remarkable speed. The risk of human error is drastically reduced in machine-operated processes, resulting in a lower rate of defects and waste. Consequently, this leads to enhanced product quality, customer satisfaction, and ultimately, increased profitability for businesses.In addition to their efficiency and accuracy, machines can also perform tasks that may be difficult, dangerous, or even impossible for humans. In industries such as construction, mining, and deep-sea exploration, machines can undertake demanding tasks that require strength and resilience, ensuring the safety of human workers. Furthermore, advancements in robotics and artificial intelligence allow machines to handle complex operations, making them versatile assets in sectors ranging from healthcare to transportation.While there are concerns about job displacement due to automation, it is essential to recognize that machines can complement human labor rather than entirely replace it. By taking on repetitive and labor-intensive tasks, machines enable workers to focus on more strategic and creative aspects of their jobs. Thus, the synergy between humans and machines can lead to a more efficient and innovative workforce.In conclusion, the benefits of machines in society are profoundly evident. Their ability to work tirelessly, produce high-quality results, and perform hazardous tasks not only enhances productivity but also fosters a safer and more efficient working environment. As technology continues to evolve, the collaboration between humans and machines will undoubtedly pave the way for a more advanced and prosperous society.
334;In the last 20 years there have been significant developments in the field of information technology (IT), for example, the World Wide Web and communication by email. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;Decade after decade, every day, scientists discover magnificent devices in the field of IT, such as interactive boards, multicore computers and laptops, tablets, which have an incredible resolution and also mobile phones, which have the power of a computer. World Wide Web and communication via email are some of the positive sides of information technology, however, there are some negative aspects.Firstly, connecting people by email is easy and fast. In addition, World Wide Web offers humanity to access to information, which they want to know for less than 10 seconds. These are two of the benefits, why IT is useful.Besides, nowadays technology is entering into our society really quick and scientists develop robots, which help people cope with their problems or just invent coffee machines, engines with integrated computers and etc. For example, before centeries, there were not washing machines, which clean your clothes, while a person do another job.Secondly, there are some drawbacks about this issue. Scientists believe that one day people will face their developments, for instance robots, and they will not succeed to control them. All this inventions will try to take control of the Earth.In conclusion, I agree that IT discoveries are likely to have more disadvantages than benefits and people should know how to use their developments properly.;In today's rapidly advancing world, the field of Information Technology (IT) is constantly evolving, showcasing remarkable innovations that have transformed the landscape of communication, education, and daily life. Devices such as interactive boards, multicore computers, laptops, and tablets with incredible resolutions are at the forefront of this technological revolution. These tools have not only enhanced accessibility to information but have also improved the quality of education and productivity in various sectors. For instance, interactive boards facilitate dynamic learning experiences, allowing students and educators to engage with content in a novel way. Similarly, the computational power of multicore processors has significantly accelerated data processing tasks, enabling complex simulations and real-time analytics.However, alongside these advancements, several negative aspects of information technology warrant attention. One major concern is the pervasive issue of digital addiction, particularly among younger individuals who may find themselves consumed by their devices. This addiction can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, impacting physical health and social skills. Furthermore, the rapid evolution of technology has also accelerated job displacement due to automation and artificial intelligence, leaving many skilled workers in traditional fields at a disadvantage. Additionally, the proliferation of high-resolution devices has contributed to the problem of information overload, making it increasingly difficult for individuals to discern credible information from misinformation. As we are inundated with an overwhelming stream of digital content, many struggle to maintain focus and engage in deep learning, which can ultimately hinder intellectual growth.In conclusion, while the advancements in information technology have undeniably revolutionized our lives for the better, it is crucial to remain mindful of the accompanying challenges. Balancing the benefits with awareness of these negative aspects is essential to foster a healthier relationship with technology and ensure its positive impact on society.
335;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, celebrities appear to become a spotlight of the mass media. Almost half of the news coverage on television and the Internet is devoted to the celebrity gossip. Not surprisingly, many people are worried that this attention to the famous people has an impact on them, especially on their children. This essay will compare both negative and positive consequences of this effect on infants.Fame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols. Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively. This means that celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace. Therefore, children may see that this behavior is inexcusable.On the other hand, too much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions. As recent surveys showed, inspired by the fame and wealth, children now prefer more to become an actor/actress or a sports star than it was in the past. Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable. This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media, but from the basis of their own interests.In conclusion, parents should be more worried about their children's attitudes to the 'cult of celebrity'. They should teach their children how to distinguish shortcoming stars from truly talented ones and to put right priorities in life.;"In contemporary society, the pervasive influence of fame on public figures and their admirers, particularly children, has sparked considerable concern. Celebrities, athletes, and influencers often enjoy a spotlight that shapes public perception and cultural norms. However, this attention comes with great responsibility, as the actions of these individuals can significantly impact their fans, especially impressionable youngsters.Public figures are acutely aware that their admirers closely monitor their behavior. For children, celebrities often serve as role models, with their choices—ranging from fashion to lifestyle— being emulated by young fans. A slip of decorum or an irresponsible action by a celebrity can lead to a ripple effect, causing children to mimic behaviors that may not always be appropriate or constructive. Therefore, with fame comes the obligation for these individuals to be mindful of their public persona, as their actions carry weight in the lives of impressionable youths.On the flip side, the relentless coverage of famous individuals can also distort children's perceptions of success and career paths. When media attention highlights glamorous lifestyles—often neglecting the hard work and struggle behind success—children may gravitate toward unrealistic aspirations. This skewed portrayal can lead youngsters to aspire to become influencers or entertainers, rather than exploring diverse fields such as science, education, or the arts, which are often overshadowed by the allure of fame. In conclusion, while fame can inspire and motivate, it is essential to recognize its dual nature. The responsibility of public figures extends beyond personal conduct; it encompasses the understanding that their influence can shape the future ambitions and values of younger generations. The challenge lies in finding a balance, ensuring that children can admire their idols while still being encouraged to explore a wide range of possibilities for their own futures."
336;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;"Recently, there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication. Indeed, mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages, bringing convenience and entertainment into our life. However, as far as I am concerned, I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems.In the first place, spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life. In the first place, as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones, they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children.Furthermore, there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as ""Iron man"". In those games, children are rewarded for being more violent, and this violence is repeated again and again. For instance, many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot, which many lead to increased aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviours. Therefore, the hardship of communication may be developed.However, other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint. With rapid development of the internet, people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet. For instance, as lots of chatting apps available online such as ""Weichat"", people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication. Therefore, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication.After having considered all the problems that I have discussed above, we can finally draw a conclusion that although mobile phones brings convenience of communication, they also contribute to some social problems.";Mobile phones have transformed the way we communicate, access information, and entertain ourselves, making them indispensable tools in modern life for people of all ages. While the convenience they offer is undeniable, I strongly believe that the proliferation of mobile phones has led to several social problems that cannot be overlooked.One of the most significant issues associated with mobile phone usage is the tendency for individuals to focus excessively on their devices, which can result in a diminishing interest in daily activities. People are becoming more engaged in virtual interactions rather than face-to-face conversations, leading to a decline in meaningful relationships. This shift in social behavior can foster feelings of isolation and loneliness, diminishing our connection with the world around us. Social gatherings are often interrupted by constant checking and scrolling through phones, which detracts from the quality and depth of human interaction.Moreover, the physical ramifications of excessive mobile phone use, particularly among children, are alarming. Extended screen time can lead to serious health concerns, with many children experiencing impaired eyesight due to prolonged exposure to screens. The blue light emitted by devices is known to strain the eyes, potentially leading to long-term vision problems. Additionally, poor posture resulting from hunching over phones can contribute to musculoskeletal issues, compromising the physical well-being of young users.In conclusion, while mobile phones undoubtedly provide convenience and entertainment in our daily lives, their widespread usage presents significant social and health challenges. The erosion of personal interactions and the physical ailments emerging from excessive screen time highlight the urgent need for a balanced approach to mobile phone usage. It is essential for society to reconsider the implications of these devices to ensure they enhance, rather than hinder, our quality of life.
337;Modern forms of communication such as email and messaging have reduced the amount of time people spend seeing their friends. This has had a negative effect on their social lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Undoubtedly, the movement of modern forms of communication has changed better, which help people to interact to others, such as email and messaging without limitation time. I totally agree that using of these soft devices have cut much of time people need to see with their relatives. However, it is had some demerits on their social lives.Mentioned to societies life style, they constantly use these kinds of electronic letter for making fellowship or just continuing theirs what they already had. Obviousness, there are other ways like social media that they could to use it for meeting theirs buddies such as Twitter and Facebook, also make the communication become feasible and limitless of time.Another perspective, using of these facilities has influenced netizens to keep themselves becoming unsociable. It caused they were swept away by virtual atmosphere, so they do not do much social live interactions with others. The consequence of this case made some people become geek, as too much of using email and messaging, without direct contacts. However, people have had own minded to keep connection with their friends as a good relationship, meet them and talk by face to face directly.In conclusion, I admittedly and strongly agree that the merits of email and messaging have reduced amount of ours time to communicate to. Besides, we need to make sure for the real gathering with our colleague.;Modern forms of communication have revolutionized the way people interact, transcending geographical boundaries and time constraints that once limited personal and professional exchanges. With the advent of technologies like email, instant messaging, and social media, individuals can now connect with one another instantly, regardless of their location. This seamless communication fosters collaboration, strengthens relationships, and enhances social connectivity, enabling people to share ideas and emotions in real-time.The efficiency of these communication tools cannot be overstated. For example, emails facilitate the rapid exchange of information and documents, while messaging apps enable quick check-ins and updates. Social media platforms allow individuals to maintain relationships over long distances, creating virtual communities and support networks that would otherwise be impossible. In a world that is increasingly fast-paced and interconnected, these tools empower individuals to stay in touch with family, friends, and colleagues at any time, leading to enhanced productivity and nurturing relationships.However, the very advancements that empower communication also come with certain demerits that can impact social lives negatively. The convenience of digital communication may lead to a decline in face-to-face interactions. People, particularly younger generations, might find themselves spending more time on their screens rather than engaging in meaningful personal interactions. This detachment can hinder the development of deeper relationships and may contribute to feelings of isolation, despite the paradox of being more connected than ever. Moreover, the pressure to respond instantly can lead to stress and anxiety, as individuals feel obligated to remain available at all times. This constant state of connectivity can blur the lines between personal and professional life, making it challenging to disconnect and recharge.In conclusion, while modern communication tools have undoubtedly improved the way we connect and interact, it is essential to remain mindful of their potential drawbacks. Striking a balance between digital communication and face-to-face interactions is crucial to cultivating fulfilling social lives in our increasingly digital world.
338;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Other believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.;"It is undeniable that children have an innocent mind, and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life. Some people think that it is better to make them competitive, while other believes to make them co-operative. Both these factors have their own values, and have been discussed in detail below:Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently. This factor initially arises from the school, where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system, and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks. This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead, but will also restrict them in many ways. For example, MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work, and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team.However, those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead. Although, they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do, but they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team.In my opinion, though competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level, but it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run; while on the contrary, co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team.To conclude, I would say that people should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life.";Title: The Value of Competitive and Cooperative Children in SocietyIn today’s dynamic environment, the traits of competitiveness and cooperativeness in children play a crucial role in shaping their future. Competitive children, often driven by personal ambition and a desire for excellence, develop a sense of confidence that allows them to tackle situations independently. Their determination to excel in various domains, such as academics, sports, or arts, fosters resilience and self-reliance. By facing challenges head-on and striving to outperform their peers, these children cultivate a strong belief in their abilities. This confidence not only empowers them to navigate obstacles but also equips them with the skills needed to make decisions and solve problems on their own.On the other hand, cooperative children thrive in team settings where collaboration and communication are essential. They possess the potential to structure and implement new and innovative ideas, leveraging the diverse strengths of their peers to achieve common goals. Through cooperation, these children learn the values of empathy, respect, and collective problem-solving. This adaptability makes them excellent candidates for group projects and community initiatives, where the exchange of ideas can lead to creative solutions that benefit everyone involved.Both competitive and cooperative traits hold significant value in society. Competitive children bring forth innovation through individual excellence, pushing boundaries and driving progress. Meanwhile, cooperative children foster a sense of community and teamwork, essential for collective success. In an increasingly interconnected world, the ability to balance these traits is vital. Encouraging children to harness their competitive spirit while also instilling the importance of cooperation will ensure they are well-equipped to navigate the complexities of adult life. Ultimately, both attributes contribute to a well-rounded character, essential for personal success and societal advancement.
339;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development?;Nowadays, the variety of communication systems used widely. As technology develops, it has negative influences in many respects. However, I strongly agree with that the technology has large positive effects on relationships between people. The main advantage is that technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely. While public use the Internet or smart phone to share information to each other at different positions. Instead of using letters, technology advanced not only gives us more spare time but also convenient and efficient. More, even if family members who are in different countries, they also can use the Internet to connect each others, especially though the images or videos, they can feel close. Furthermore, technology is also essential for students, live in remote districts, shared the valuable natural resources with friends. Another issue is that in the ever-accelerated updating of science and technology, technology provides opportunities for people to establish the social network. In the past, people might have had pen friends in other countries, but now, thanks to the social networking websites, people can easily to find someone who has similar interests. Also, they can connect with friends who have been out of touch for a long time by using the Internet. In this way, technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships. In conclusion, I agree with that the technology has more optimal effects on people's interaction, because it helps ordinary people to make new friends and to maintain relationships.;As technology develops, it undeniably has its drawbacks, impacting various aspects of our lives in negative ways. Issues such as decreased face-to-face communication, increased isolation, and the potential for cyberbullying are often cited as detrimental effects of our reliance on digital devices. However, despite these challenges, I strongly believe that technology has significantly enhanced the relationships between people, fostering connections that transcend geographical boundaries and enhancing the quality of interpersonal interactions.One of the most profound positive impacts of technology on relationships is the ability to maintain and strengthen connections regardless of distance. Social media platforms, messaging apps, and video calling services allow people to communicate instantly with family and friends, no matter where they are in the world. This capability has transformed long-distance relationships, making it easier for couples, families, and friends to share experiences and maintain emotional closeness, regardless of physical separation.Moreover, technology has facilitated the formation of communities that might not have existed otherwise. Online forums and interest-based groups provide a space for individuals with shared hobbies or experiences to come together, fostering bonds that can lead to lasting friendships. For instance, individuals can engage in support networks for various challenges, from mental health issues to parenting, finding solace and camaraderie in shared experiences. Additionally, technology fosters inclusivity, allowing people from different backgrounds, cultures, and abilities to connect and collaborate. Video calls enable individuals with disabilities to participate in social events that might have been inaccessible, thus promoting a sense of belonging and community. In a world that often feels divided, technology serves as a bridge, helping people unite in understanding and empathy.In conclusion, while it is essential to acknowledge the negative influences of technology on society, it is equally crucial to recognize its profound positive effects on relationships. Through enhanced communication, community building, and inclusivity, technology has the potential to bring people closer together, fostering deeper connections and enriching our lives.
340;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;With the development of technology, whether or not it is still necessary to protect the traditional skills and lifestyles leads to a drastic controversy which is becoming a public concern, especially considering the significant impact taken by technology. As far as I am concerned, the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to.Traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society, in terms of healthcare, environmental protection and cultural inherit. Although technology takes convenience to humankind, it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life, like sedentary lifestyle. Instead, traditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance. Meanwhile, due to the fact that traditional skills rely little on fossil energy, it is more environmentally-friendly, which should be promoted to reduce the threat of climate change. Furthermore those tradition-related things convey traditional culture and values. These are important foundation of modern civilization. Protection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems.Some people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes. In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance, it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions. Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life, so as to make people to realize the value of them.All in all, protection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently, but also contributes to the next generation.;Traditional skills and lifestyles hold significant relevance in contemporary society, addressing various challenges in healthcare, environmental protection, and cultural inheritance. As the modern world grapples with rapid technological advancements and urbanization, there is a growing recognition of the importance of these age-old practices in providing sustainable solutions to modern problems.In the sphere of healthcare, traditional medicinal practices offer insights that can complement contemporary medical treatments. Herbal remedies, passed down through generations, often contain valuable compounds that modern science is now beginning to validate. For instance, traditional knowledge of plant-based medicines can lead to the development of new pharmaceuticals. Moreover, holistic approaches inherent in many traditional health systems emphasize the importance of mental and spiritual well-being, aspects that are increasingly recognized as vital to maintaining overall health.Environmental protection is another area where traditional lifestyles can serve as a blueprint for sustainable living. Indigenous practices often promote a profound respect for nature, emphasizing harmony with ecosystems rather than exploitation. Techniques such as sustainable farming and fishing practices rooted in traditional knowledge can help mitigate climate change and conserve biodiversity. By adopting these age-old methods, modern society can learn to live in a manner that preserves environmental integrity for future generations.Culturally, the protection of traditional skills and lifestyles fosters a deeper understanding of ancient cultures. This cultural inheritance enriches modern society by providing a sense of identity and continuity. Engaging with traditional crafts and practices not only preserves these skills but also stimulates local economies and tourism, creating a vibrant cultural exchange.In conclusion, traditional skills and lifestyles are not relics of the past but rather vital tools that can enhance our understanding of health, environmental stewardship, and cultural identity. Embracing these traditions can empower us to tackle pressing contemporary issues while fostering a richer, more diverse society. By integrating traditional wisdom with modern innovations, we can work towards a sustainable future that honors our heritage.
341;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to be co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend, which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them, and also be able to teach them teamwork skill. However, some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative, both the values have its arguments.A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers, and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents, to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system. Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently, but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others. Being competitive leads them to success, but could also restrict them in many ways. For example, it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project.On the other hand, cooperation is also an essential quality for children, no matter in school activities or in communities. Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others, which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team. After all, in society, there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself. For example, famous singers or movie stars, despite of their talent to make them successful, there are always a team to manage works or deal with things.In my point of view, though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success, but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work. To sum up, I would say that schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community.;The debate between fostering competition and cooperation in children is a nuanced one, with valid arguments on both sides. Each approach brings forth essential skills that contribute to a child's development and preparedness for future challenges. On one hand, instilling a sense of competition in children can significantly enhance their motivation to learn and strive for excellence. Competitive environments encourage children to push their boundaries, become more disciplined, and develop a strong work ethic. This urge to outperform peers can lead to improved academic performance and the cultivation of resilience, as children learn to cope with setbacks and failures. Furthermore, competitive activities, such as sports or academic contests, often bring out leadership qualities and the drive to innovate—traits that are valuable in adulthood.However, the importance of cooperation cannot be understated. In today’s interconnected world, the ability to work effectively with others is crucial. School activities, group projects, and community involvement all demand a degree of collaboration that helps children cultivate empathy, communication skills, and the ability to compromise. Cooperative learning fosters a sense of community and belonging, allowing children to appreciate diverse perspectives. This social skill set is vital not only in educational settings but also in the workplace, where teamwork is often essential for success.Ultimately, both competition and cooperation are pivotal to a child's holistic development. Striking a balance between the two can help cultivate well-rounded individuals who are ambitious yet collaborative. Encouraging competitive spirit in appropriate contexts while simultaneously promoting teamwork may yield the best outcomes, equipping children with the necessary tools to thrive in various spheres of life. Therefore, parents and educators should consider integrating both values in their teaching methodologies to prepare children for a future where both competition and cooperation will be indispensable.
342;Some people think that advertising give more harms than good to our society. Other refute this. Discuss both views and give your opinion;On these days, with the assistance of advertisement, people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement. Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages, I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives.On the one hand, it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell. In addition to this, all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods. For example, some kinds of shampoo, namely Sunsilk, Clear, Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits. However, the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement. On the other hand, it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers, writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands. Moreover, advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers. Take Coca cola for an example, this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising. No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world. Last but not least, online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost, convenience and easily observing.To sum up, everything has its own gains and losses and advertisement is not an exception. From my point of view, advertising will be better if producers and advertisers are more honest in producing advertisements to give people the general view on one product.;"The debate surrounding the impact of advertising on society is multifaceted, with some arguing that the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. One cannot deny that advertising plays a transformative role in our lives, providing crucial opportunities for various professionals. The advertising industry creates jobs for a diverse range of individuals, from producers and writers to models and cameramen. These roles not only drive economic growth but also foster creativity and innovation in marketing strategies. Moreover, the evolution of digital platforms has revolutionized the way advertisements are delivered, making online advertising one of the most effective methods for reaching consumers. The benefits of online advertising are numerous; it generally involves lower costs compared to traditional media, offers convenience for both advertisers and consumers, and allows for targeted campaigns that can be easily monitored and adjusted. Businesses can analyze consumer behavior through various metrics, honing their strategies for maximum effectiveness while minimizing waste.However, it’s essential to acknowledge the potential harms that advertising can inflict on society, such as the promotion of unrealistic standards and consumerism. Critics argue that ads often manipulate emotions and desires, leading people to feel inadequate if they do not possess particular products. This can influence a culture of excessive consumption, where individuals prioritize material possessions over personal well-being.In conclusion, while advertising undoubtedly offers significant economic benefits and job creation, it is vital to strike a balance between its advantages and the potential negative impacts it may have on consumer behavior and societal values. As we navigate a world saturated with advertisements, fostering greater consumer awareness and responsibility can help mitigate these negatives while still appreciating the positive contributions of the advertising industry."
343;Some modern artists receive huge sums of money for the things they create, while other struggle to survive. Government should take steps to resolve this unfair situation. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"The amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair. In a field of art, modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money. Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation, critics against such view. I agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in.Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work. It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector. Also, the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent. For example, a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production. On the other hand, modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do, such making impossible become possible. Pieter Padang, Minion creator, has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric ""I swear"" become ""underwear"" when the Minion sing in Despicable Me. He granted huge sums for such idea.Striking contrast, labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day. In any case, a musician playing ""I swear"" several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation. Moreover, government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it, art value is about taste.Having said that the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art, while the term of struggle might different with other field of job. I agree that government cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar because art price is about taste.";The disparity between the earnings of modern artists and those of laborers is a pressing issue that highlights the complex dynamics of value and compensation in society. While a modern artist may command exorbitant prices for a single piece of artwork, often reaching into the millions, laborers—a demographic that works tirelessly in sectors such as construction, agriculture, and manufacturing—might toil for years to earn a similar sum. This reality raises questions about fairness and the role of government in addressing perceived inequalities.Proponents of government intervention argue that the disparity is unjust. They contend that the value of labor should be recognized and compensated fairly, regardless of the field. Artists, although deserving of recognition for their creative contributions, are often seen as benefiting from a market that values aesthetics over the essential work performed by laborers. Advocates for change suggest that the government should implement policies that provide greater support and financial security for lower-wage workers,  ensuring their hard work is recognized and rewarded.However, critics of this view emphasize that the market operates on principles of supply and demand, where individuals are willing to pay substantial sums for unique pieces of art. They argue that the high value placed on an artist’s work is a reflection of cultural significance, emotional impact, and rarity, which cannot be directly compared to the wage of laborers. Additionally, they advocate for personal responsibility and the idea that individuals should seek opportunities for advancement in their chosen fields rather than rely on government intervention.In conclusion, while the disparity in earnings between modern artists and laborers raises legitimate concerns about equity, the solution is not straightforward. It lies in recognizing the different values that society places on various types of work and understanding that market dynamics play a significant role in determining wages. Instead of government intervention, fostering a culture of appreciation for all types of work, each contributing uniquely to society, may be a more effective approach to address this issue.
344;People tend to work longer hours nowadays. Working long hours has a negative effect on themselves, their families and the society, so working hours should be restricted. Do you agree or disagree?;"Working longer hours is becoming prevalent in these days. There is a saying in my native village, ""Health is Wealth"". I believe many of people including me are not really considering the importance of health. The need for increased working hours might be because of enhanced competitive environment and desire to acquire much money and promotion. However, people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life. In my opinion, a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours. First of all, many of us would agree to the fact that people; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health. By working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick. Moreover, they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons. The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life.Secondly, these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign. As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities. For instance, I would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years. Recently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries. He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him.To conclude this, I would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies. This will help in uplift of society, and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person.";"In today’s fast-paced and competitive world, the phenomenon of individuals working extended hours has become increasingly common. While dedication and hard work are often lauded, this trend has serious ramifications on both physical health and personal life. Evidence suggests that when people overextend themselves in their jobs, they can experience a range of negative effects that not only compromise their well-being but also impact their relationships and overall quality of life.One significant consequence of long working hours is physical fatigue. Chronic exhaustion can lead to a diminished capacity for motivation, making individuals more prone to feelings of laziness. This lethargy often extends beyond the workplace, affecting personal commitments and interests. Consequently, many individuals find themselves neglecting physical exercise, which is essential for maintaining fitness and overall health. This lack of physical activity can lead to various health concerns, including obesity, cardiovascular disease, and mental health issues such as anxiety and depression.Furthermore, the pressure to perform and produce results can foster an unhealthy workaholic mentality. Individuals become excessively addicted to their work, often blurring the boundaries between their professional and personal lives. As work consumes a growing portion of their time, personal relationships can suffer. People might miss out on quality time with family and friends, resulting in feelings of isolation and disconnection. Over time, this imbalance can lead to a lack of fulfillment in life, as priorities are skewed in favor of occupational demands rather than personal connections and well-being.In conclusion, while working long hours may seem like a pathway to success, the adverse effects on health and personal life cannot be ignored. The need for balance is crucial; individuals must prioritize their physical health and meaningful relationships to foster a more fulfilling and sustainable lifestyle. Achieving this equilibrium can lead to enhanced productivity and a happier, healthier life overall."
345;A successful person is one who has earned a lot of money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;It's such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money, especially in nowadays society. Each individual visualize success differently. Still, my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income.Money is undeniably pivotal, but ways of earning it is also various. A person's great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself. Nevertheless, a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working, dedication and passion. Whether it is a personal or a social achievement, that man is laudable.More importantly, the more beneficial for the society his achievement is, the more successful he is considered. For instance, Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention's productivity is countless useful for mankind. On the other hand, the fact of knowing a man's utilization of his money remains in the dark. Therefore, judging a person by his income is difficult, especially in the success aspect.In conclusion, using only money as a scale to measure a man's success is impossible despite the fact that it is the essential in basic needs. Yet, it is the common scene that a man can be publicly considered successful when his achievements, which can only accomplished by passion, dedication and ethics, are helpful not only for himself.;"In contemporary society, the notion of success is frequently measured by one’s financial status. However, a truly successful man is characterized not merely by his income, but by the accomplishments and meaningful achievements he garners throughout his life. Financial wealth, while undeniably important, is a mere byproduct of a deeper commitment to personal growth, hard work, and unwavering dedication to one's passions.The multifaceted nature of success goes beyond the confines of a paycheck. A successful individual excels in various areas of life, such as personal development, community involvement, and the pursuit of dreams. For instance, someone may earn a modest income yet contribute significantly to society through humanitarian efforts, creative endeavors, or educational advancements. These achievements illustrate a profound impact that transcends monetary value, emphasizing the importance of one’s legacy and the influence they have on others.Moreover, the journey to success is not a linear path; it requires perseverance, resilience, and a genuine passion for one’s pursuits. Hard work is often the backbone of accomplishment. Those who dedicate themselves to their craft, whether it be in the arts, sciences, or trades, develop skills that can lead to recognition and fulfillment. It is the dedication to honing one’s abilities and the passion for what they do that ultimately defines their success.Furthermore, individuals can choose various avenues to earn money, from traditional employment to entrepreneurship or freelance work. Each path presents unique challenges and rewards, indicating that success can be achieved in numerous ways. Through hard work, dedication, and passion, a man can cultivate a life rich in achievements that speak to his character and values, thus redefining what it truly means to be successful. Ultimately, a successful man is one whose life resonates with purpose and impact, rather than a mere financial measure."
346;Question: Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which there are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowdays, people's choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television, street, magazine etc. This argument may be true that people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life. For example, in most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs.In addition, products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought. A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society. And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it.However, buying habit is a very personal things for individuals, the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy, sometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption. It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income. Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase. On the other hand, children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not, since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary.In my opinion, I think buying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements. But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising. So it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company (for example, toys company) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need.;In today's consumer-driven society, the influence of advertising on purchasing decisions is undeniable. Industries leverage various platforms, including television, billboards, and magazines, to promote their products and create a sense of urgency or desire among consumers. While it is true that advertising can significantly sway individuals, leading them to buy items they do not necessarily need, it is important to recognize that buying habits are deeply personal and multifaceted.Firstly, consumers are bombarded with countless advertisements each day, crafted to evoke emotions and compel them to make impulsive purchases. An advertisement’s persuasive language, appealing visuals, and celebrity endorsements can create an illusion of necessity, making consumers feel that they require what is being sold. This phenomenon can lead to overconsumption and purchasing items that provide little real value or satisfaction in one’s life.However, dismissing the role of individual needs and circumstances in consumption choices would be an oversimplification. People often engage in a reflective purchasing process, where their decisions are shaped not only by outside influences but also by personal values, budgetary considerations, and specific needs. For example, an individual may choose to purchase a quality item over a cheaper, advertised alternative based on their financial capacity or desire for longevity and sustainability. Moreover, the rise of digital literacy has equipped many consumers to critically evaluate advertisements, seeking out genuine consumer reviews and alternatives before making a purchase. This shift demonstrates that while advertising plays a significant role in shaping preferences, it does not operate in a vacuum. Ultimately, purchasing decisions reflect a complex interplay of external influence and personal agency. It’s essential to acknowledge that advertisements may entice, but it is the individual’s unique circumstances that govern the final decision to buy or not.
347;Some people think that by paying taxes they made enough contribution to their society. TO what extent do you agree or disagree? ;Paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country. Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that. Personally, I tend to disagree with this view.To start with, all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government, as it is the most important source of government's revenue, which is mainly used to serve all citizens. For example, a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability, so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment. The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers. Although these workers do not produce profit directly, what they do is for the well-being of the whole society.However, I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax. As we know, there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others. It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, but such financial help is usually far from enough. In such case, aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support. Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force. There are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited. So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department.In conclusion, it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government. Other than that, they have other critical obligations to take, in order to make our society function in an ordered way.;Paying taxes is often viewed as a primary obligation of citizens in nearly every nation, serving as a crucial mechanism for funding public services and infrastructure. This financial contribution enables governments to run effectively, ensuring that citizens have access to education, healthcare, and security. However, while fulfilling this fiscal duty is important, I would argue that it is not the sole responsibility of citizens. There are various other significant duties that individuals have towards each other and their communities, particularly in supporting the impoverished and disabled members of society.The act of paying taxes can sometimes lead to a sense of complacency, as individuals may feel that their financial contributions absolve them of further involvement in their communities. Yet, many marginalized individuals face challenges that financial aid alone cannot resolve. Impoverished or disabled people often require personal support, understanding, and direct assistance from those around them. For example, volunteering time at local shelters, teaching skills to those who need job training, or simply offering companionship or advocacy can make a profound difference for those in need. Moreover, fostering a compassionate society involves acting on the belief that everyone deserves dignity and respect. By engaging in community initiatives or supporting charities, individuals contribute to a culture of empathy and care that transcends monetary obligations. When citizens actively participate in uplifting their neighbors, they are not only addressing immediate needs but also fostering a more robust, interconnected community.In conclusion, while paying taxes is an essential responsibility of citizenship, it is equally important for individuals to engage in social support and community building. By balancing these responsibilities, we can create a more inclusive society that looks after its most vulnerable members, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to thrive.
348;School should teach children the academic subje cts which have a close relationship with their future careers, so other subjects like music and sports are not important. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"People have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school. Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school, I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program.Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics, physics because these subject are necessary for students' future. This is understandable when labor market now has high competition; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification. In addition, the unemployment rate is always high, so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job. Although those above reasons are acceptable, I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job. Firstly, studying music, art or sports is also very important to students. This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them. Secondly, to get a job in labor market, not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork, presentation. For instance, through taking part in a sport, students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills. Therefore, these subjects might fulfil the students' ability. Finally, children's future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school, it is the result of their efforts and capacity.In conclusion, although the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children, it seem to me that the effects of learning music, sports are profound.";In contemporary society, there is a prevalent belief that students must primarily focus on academic subjects such as mathematics and physics to secure a successful future. Proponents of this view argue that these subjects are essential for gaining employment and driving economic growth. However, I contend that there are many dimensions of education that extend beyond mere vocational training, highlighting the importance of holistic personal development, emotional intelligence, and life skills that are crucial for leading a fulfilling life.First and foremost, students should be encouraged to explore subjects that foster creativity and critical thinking. The arts, literature, and social sciences offer invaluable opportunities for young people to develop a well-rounded perspective on the world. Engaging with different forms of expression and understanding human behavior can cultivate empathy, nurturing the emotional intelligence that is increasingly recognized as vital in the workplace. Employers often prioritize candidates with strong interpersonal skills, adaptability, and the ability to collaborate—qualities that are enhanced by a diverse educational experience.Moreover, students need to learn practical skills that will enable them to navigate everyday life. Financial literacy, effective communication, and problem-solving competencies are essential for personal and professional success. These skills may not be directly tied to specific academic subjects but are crucial for making informed decisions, managing relationships, and overcoming challenges in a rapidly changing world. Finally, education should also prioritize the development of values such as resilience, social responsibility, and a sense of community. In an era where job markets can be volatile, a strong moral compass and the ability to contribute positively to society are invaluable. In conclusion, while academic subjects are important for career opportunities, education should encompass a broader spectrum of knowledge and skills that prepare students for life well beyond the classroom. Fostering a balance of intellectual rigor and personal growth ensures that students are not only employable but also capable of leading meaningful, well-rounded lives.
349;Some people believe that information available in the internet will end the era of newspapers and magazines. Do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion and examples.;Digital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe. With this advancement, newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence. Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media. But many other still thinks they are going to stay. I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time. I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news.A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis. This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly. For example, when the aircraft MH 370 went missing, everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident. The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth. In such situations, newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media. Instead of waiting for next publication, people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two. This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines.People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research, satisfy interest, etc. For example, one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War. It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at. But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details. This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines.To conclude, the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider for valid reasons. Though considering the current infrastructure and mindset of people, paper media will continue for another few years.;The advent of the internet has drastically transformed the landscape of media consumption, creating a compelling debate about the future of traditional paper media. While some advocate for the enduring relevance of newspapers and magazines, I firmly believe that these forms of media are on a path toward obsolescence.One of the primary reasons for this belief lies in the convenience and accessibility of internet-based media. With just a few clicks, individuals can access an abundance of news articles, journals, and publications from around the globe. This instant access not only outstrips the distribution capabilities of traditional print but also offers a level of interactivity and immediacy that print media simply cannot compete with. Readers can engage with content through comments, shares, and personalized feeds, fostering a dynamic community of discourse that static newspapers or magazines cannot provide.Additionally, the cost factor cannot be overlooked. The production and distribution of paper media come with significant expenses—costs that are ultimately passed on to consumers. In contrast, many online platforms offer free or low-cost options, making information more accessible to a broader audience. As the younger generations, who predominantly favor digital formats, become the primary consumers of news and information, the demand for traditional print media is likely to dwindle.Moreover, environmental concerns play a vital role in this transition. The push for sustainability has led to increased scrutiny of paper production, prompting many to seek eco-friendly alternatives. This societal shift towards digital media aligns with eco-conscious values, further diminishing the allure of paper media.In conclusion, while traditional newspapers and magazines have played a significant role in the dissemination of information for centuries, their time is rapidly coming to an end. The increased convenience, cost-effectiveness, and environmental considerations of internet-based media will pave the way for a future devoid of paper media, marking a pivotal shift in how we consume information.
350;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In many societies, choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered. Nevertheless, while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor, I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard.To begin with, I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well. However, aspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life. People, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary. In this sense, it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position.Further and even more importantly, most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements, skills and the position they reach. In other words, career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are, likely, more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary. For example, people, who work in monotonous jobs, where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied, even though they have a very good salaries.In conclusion, I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators, as there are other even more important aspects such as: friendly co-workers, working conditions and professional achievements.;In today’s fast-paced and consumer-driven world, the choice of a job is often primarily influenced by the salary offered. Many individuals believe that financial compensation is the ultimate indicator of job satisfaction and success. However, focusing solely on salary overlooks other equally important aspects that contribute significantly to an individual's happiness and overall quality of life. The workplace environment, relationships with colleagues, and working conditions deserve equal consideration when making career choices.The camaraderie and support from friendly colleagues can greatly enhance one’s daily work experience. A positive workplace culture fosters collaboration and encourages open communication, which leads to increased job satisfaction. When employees feel valued and supported by their peers, they are more likely to be engaged in their work and motivated to perform their best. A friendly environment not only makes day-to-day tasks more enjoyable but also diminishes stress levels, subsequently improving employees' mental health.Additionally, the physical working environment is crucial for productivity and morale. Factors such as workspace layout, lighting, and access to resources can profoundly impact an employee’s performance. An organized and aesthetically pleasing workspace can make a substantial difference in how comfortably and efficiently one performs their job.Moreover, job flexibility and work-life balance are increasingly recognized as vital components of a fulfilling career. A position that allows for remote work or flexible hours can be more valuable than a higher-paying role without such benefits. Employees are often happier when they can harmonize their professional responsibilities with personal interests and family time.In conclusion, while salary is undoubtedly an essential factor in job selection, it should not be the sole determinant. A harmonious workplace with supportive colleagues and conducive working conditions often translates to greater job satisfaction and overall quality of life. Balancing these factors along with financial considerations will lead to a more fulfilling and sustainable career path.
351;Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on children. Do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, computer is an essential part of everyday life. Around the globe, the effect is evident on children also. It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis. This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers.The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text, image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about. As an example, students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter. It's hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers. That is how, computer impacts children on a positive note.Nowadays, computers enable people to prepare presentations, draw complex graphs and pictures, document thesis in a simple though efficient way. When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age, they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world. For instance, students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects, get an edge over others at an early stage of their career. From this, it's clear that computer has a positive effect on the children.Following the demonstration of a computer's contribution in children's study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards, it is agreed that computer is a boon to children. However, parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don't get misled.;In today's digital age, computers have become an essential part of everyday life, influencing how individuals, including children, engage with the world. The pervasive nature of technology is evident in the way children interact with computers in their daily routines. While some argue that daily computer use can negatively affect children, this perspective fails to recognize the myriad benefits that computers offer, particularly in accessing vast resources available on the internet.Firstly, computers serve as powerful educational tools. With the internet at their fingertips, children have the opportunity to explore a wealth of information that extends far beyond traditional textbooks. They can access online courses, tutorials, and educational videos that cater to various learning styles, enabling personalized learning experiences. This resourcefulness not only enhances their understanding of subjects but also fosters critical thinking and self-directed learning.Moreover, computers facilitate creativity and expression. Various software applications allow children to explore their artistic abilities through digital art, music production, and storytelling. This creative outlet not only nurtures their imaginative skills but also provides a platform for them to showcase their talents to a broader audience, building confidence and self-esteem.Additionally, daily computer use can improve children’s technological literacy, an essential skill in today's job market. Early exposure to computers prepares them for future careers, equipping them with the necessary skills to navigate an increasingly digital world. In this context, computer usage becomes a vehicle for cultivating 21st-century skills, such as communication, collaboration, and problem-solving.In conclusion, while concerns about the negative impacts of excessive computer use are valid, the benefits that computers provide in accessing vast resources and fostering creativity far outweigh these drawbacks. Appropriate and guided use of computers can empower children, helping them to thrive in both their academic pursuits and future professional endeavors.
352;Children who are brought up in families that do not have large amounts of money are better prepared to deal with the problems of adult life than children brought up by wealthy parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;According to some people, child who is brought up in less well-off family is more quick-witted and can tackle with an adult life problems better than who is from affluent ones. However, I completely disagree with this position.To begin with, children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as: crime, thievery and thuggery. Moreover, these people will not have an access to a good education. As a result, they can be proselytized into bad isms. For example, most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people, because the person with better education has a wider outlook, which will allow no brainwash. In this sense, people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms.Nevertheless, people who are born in well-off families have access to good education, which will have a positive impact on their later life. Secondly, children from rich families have better skills on how to use money, because they use it a lot of times. Finally, wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines, which will be very beneficial for the health of a child. For instance, many good medicines cost vast amounts of money, which cannot be afforded by poorer families.In conclusion, I disagree with the opinion that children who are brought up in less well-of families are, likely, more successful in the future life due to aforementioned reasons.;The belief that children raised in less affluent families are more quick-witted and better equipped to handle adult life problems than those from wealthier backgrounds is a contentious viewpoint. While some may argue in favor of this notion, I completely disagree with it for several reasons.Firstly, children from poorer families often face significant challenges that can lead to the development of negative habits. For instance, the pressures of financial instability may push some individuals towards crime, thievery, or thuggery as means of survival. These behaviors not only jeopardize their safety but also hinder their ability to develop constructive problem-solving skills. Instead of learning how to navigate life's challenges positively, their experiences may lead to a cycle of maladaptive behaviors that threaten their future well-being.Additionally, access to quality education is a crucial factor that cannot be overlooked. Children growing up in affluent families typically have better opportunities to receive a solid education, including access to resources, extracurricular activities, and networking opportunities. This educational advantage equips them with critical thinking skills and provides them with tools necessary for success in adult life. In contrast, children from poorer backgrounds often attend underfunded schools with limited access to advanced learning materials and experienced teachers, which can diminish their chances of achieving their full potential.Moreover, while adaptability and street smarts are valuable traits, they do not necessarily compensate for the lack of foundational skills that a quality education provides. Life in adult society often requires a diverse skill set, critical thinking, and the ability to navigate complex social situations — all of which are nurtured through a stable upbringing and quality education.In conclusion, the assertion that children from less affluent families are inherently more capable of handling adult life challenges than their affluent counterparts is oversimplified and largely unfounded. Factors such as exposure to crime and lack of educational opportunities fundamentally undermine the developmental advantages that these children might otherwise possess. Therefore, it is critical to advocate for equitable access to resources for all children, regardless of their family's financial status.
353;Many of the medical problems that people are experiencing in today's world are due to the fact that we have a very sedentary lifestyle. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;It is certainly true that modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before. Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle. However, while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors, I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact.To begin with, I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems. The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology. In earlier times, for instance, even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities. Nowadays people, especially inhabitants of cities, are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools.Nevertheless, there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems. Firstly, the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses. Many people, for example, are suffering from allergy because of these gasses. Secondly, foods with a low quality such as fast foods, junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively. Finally, life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam, traffic accidents and others.Given these evidences, it can be seen that people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses due to aforementioned reasons.;"In contemporary society, individuals are increasingly grappling with a range of health issues that differ markedly from those faced by previous generations. While many attribute these problems to a sedentary lifestyle, I contend that various other factors are significantly impacting health more profoundly.The rise of technology is a primary factor influencing modern health. With the prevalence of smartphones, computers, and streaming services, people are more susceptible to spending long hours in front of screens, leading to physical inactivity. However, technology’s influence extends beyond physical health; it can also affect mental well-being. The constant connectivity of social media can contribute to anxiety, depression, and isolation, which were less prevalent in previous eras. The pressure to maintain a certain online persona can take a toll on one’s self-esteem and mental health, far surpassing the effects of physical inactivity alone.Furthermore, dietary habits have substantially changed in the modern age. The convenience of fast food and processed snacks often outweighs the time-consuming effort of preparing healthier meals. This shift in eating habits has led to an increase in obesity rates and associated diseases like diabetes and heart conditions. The food industry’s aggressive marketing of unhealthy options, coupled with a general lack of nutritional education, exacerbates this issue.Additionally, the pace of life has accelerated, introducing a unique form of stress that older generations did not experience to the same extent. The demands of work, family, and societal pressures frequently lead to chronic stress, which has been linked to numerous health problems, including cardiovascular diseases and weakened immune systems.In conclusion, while a sedentary lifestyle certainly contributes to modern health problems, I believe the convergence of technology, poor dietary choices, and increased stressors plays a more critical role in shaping the health challenges we face today. Addressing these multifaceted issues is essential for promoting overall well-being in our increasingly complex world."
354;Foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten. Do you agree or disagree?;"Educational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children. Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school. However, those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years. This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children's learning. I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten.To begin with, children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years. Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to. Moreover, teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning. Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language, so quality education will be delivered. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners, and the best time to hone them is in their younger years. The introduction of foreign language will be new to them; however, their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend. In this way, grasping a new language will be natural to them. In addition, the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers. Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years. It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages.In conclusion, the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people; however, there are those who disagree. I am totally convinced that if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools, this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children.";"The debate surrounding when to introduce foreign language instruction in education has gained considerable attention in recent years. While some advocate for the formal introduction of foreign languages at an older age, I firmly believe that children should begin learning a secondary language as early as kindergarten. The cognitive and social advantages gained from early foreign language education ultimately enhance a child’s learning experience and development.Firstly, research indicates that young children possess a remarkable ability to acquire new languages, often referred to as the critical period hypothesis. During these formative years, their brains are particularly receptive to linguistic nuances, pronunciation, and vocabulary. Initiating foreign language instruction in pre-school enables children to develop native-like fluency and accents, which are crucial for effective communication. Moreover, the immersive exposure to a second language at this tender age can lead to enhanced cognitive abilities, including improved problem-solving skills and heightened creativity, as children learn to think in more than one linguistic framework.Furthermore, learning a foreign language early fosters cultural awareness and sensitivity. In an increasingly globalized world, it is imperative for children to understand and appreciate diverse cultures. By introducing foreign languages in kindergarten, children can cultivate empathy and respect for different perspectives from an early age. Such exposure not only enriches their social interactions but also equips them with the tools to thrive in multicultural environments as they grow.Opponents of early language instruction often argue that it may detract from foundational skills in literacy and numeracy. However, the cognitive benefits linked to bilingualism often translate to improved overall academic performance. Balancing language learning with other subjects can be effectively managed through integrated teaching methods.In conclusion, I advocate for early foreign language instruction starting in kindergarten. The cognitive benefits, enhanced cultural awareness, and increased adaptability it fosters in young learners will undoubtedly prepare them for a future where communication and understanding across cultures are paramount. Early foreign language education is not merely beneficial; it is essential in shaping well-rounded, globally aware individuals."
355;International tourism has become a huge industry in the world. Some people think that the problems caused by international tourism outweigh benefits. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the advancement of long-distance transportation, international tourism has boomed in the last few decades. Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits. I disagree with this view.I admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment. In order to meet the needs of tourists, local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions, which may result in the destruction of natural habitats. Tourism also creates more pollution and waste, including growing emission of greenhouse gases, dumped leftovers and overuse of water, power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels. Based on these grounds, it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be encouraged.However, flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy. Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions, but also pay for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment. Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services, and more employment opportunities can be created as well. I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment.Furthermore, the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well. The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably. With adequate local facilities and services available, they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing. In addition, both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before, and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations.In conclusion, the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale. Although there are some inevitable problems, they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken.;International tourism has undeniably surged over the past few decades, emerging as a vital component of the global economy. This growth has sparked a heated debate, with some individuals asserting that the influx of tourists brings more problems than benefits. However, when scrutinizing the broader spectrum of outcomes, it becomes clear that flourishing tourism can be incredibly rewarding, particularly in terms of bolstering local economies.One of the primary advantages of international tourism is the substantial economic infusion it provides to local communities. Destinations that attract significant tourist traffic often experience a boost in revenue generated from accommodations, dining, and recreational activities. This influx of money not only supports local businesses but also leads to job creation, enabling residents to secure stable employment and enhancing their quality of life. Additionally, tourism can lead to increased investment in local infrastructure, improving public services like transportation, healthcare, and education.Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge the potential downsides of booming tourism. Overcrowding, environmental degradation, and the commodification of culture can pose significant challenges for local communities. These issues can lead to a decline in the quality of life for residents and may result in a backlash against tourists. Moreover, the economic benefits of tourism can be unevenly distributed, often favoring large corporations over local enterprises, which raises concerns about sustainability and equity.Despite these challenges, the overall economic impact of thriving tourism generally outweighs the drawbacks. By implementing responsible tourism practices, communities can mitigate adverse effects while reaping the rewards of increased financial input. Sustainable tourism initiatives, such as eco-friendly accommodations and cultural preservation projects, can help balance local needs with tourist expectations.In conclusion, while concerns about international tourism are valid, the economic benefits it drives for local communities are substantial. The key lies in fostering a tourism model that prioritizes sustainability, ensuring that both visitors and residents can share in the rewards of this booming industry.
356;Some children can learn more efficiently by watching TV. Therefore, children should watch TV regularly both in school and at home? do you agree or disagree? ;Education is undeniably pivotal for an individual. Although, it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children, I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs. The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method. Thus, physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters' skills.To begin with, classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child. Technology and its advance, to some degrees, have influenced the educational industry positively. Nevertheless, it has not changed the importance of teachers' role in classes. The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this. Yet, monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless. Therefore, teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens. Secondly, watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it. On the other hand, children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity, cooperation, competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms. For instance, a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries. As a result, such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career.In conclusion, despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children, kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity. School has been applying traditional teaching procedure since for ages. Additionally, it still performs at its best to equip a child with essential skills.;Title: The Impact of Television on Child Development: A Call for Active EngagementIn recent years, the increased screen time among children—primarily through television—has raised concerns among educators and parents alike. Watching TV is a fundamentally passive action that offers little in terms of creativity, interaction, or critical thinking. As children sit absorbed in a screen, they often miss out on the myriad of enriching activities that foster essential life skills. Therefore, promoting longer periods of television watching runs counter to developmental needs and social learning.Research consistently shows that children who engage in activities that require creativity, cooperation, and competition tend to perform significantly better in multiple aspects of their lives. Activities such as team sports, art classes, or even simple cooperative games stimulate innovative thinking and problem-solving skills. These experiences cultivate not only cognitive abilities but also social skills, such as teamwork and empathy. Rather than sitting in front of a television, children should be encouraged to engage in activities that promote active participation and interaction—elements that are often sorely lacking in passive viewing.Moreover, prolonged television viewing has been linked to various negative outcomes, including obesity and reduced academic performance. When children spend excessive time glued to a screen, they forfeit opportunities for physical activity, social interaction, and meaningful engagement with their environment. A shift towards promoting active pursuits rather than passive consumption can significantly improve children's emotional and physical well-being.In conclusion, while television can offer certain educational benefits, it is crucial to limit the amount of time children spend watching it. Instead, cultivating a culture that prioritizes creativity, cooperation, and healthy competition will empower children to develop holistically. By emphasizing active engagement over passive consumption, we can better prepare them for the complex challenges of the future.
357;In some countries, with the widespread use of the internet, people are able to work or study from home, instead of having to travel to work or college. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages? Discuss and state your own opinion.;Undoubtedly this is an era of internet which impacts one's personal as well as professional life. The effect is seen more on the developed countries where people choose to work or study from home instead of going to office or university. Some consider this approach to be an advantage while others reject this as a disadvantage. Both the points of views will be discussed in order.On the one hand, the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous. For one, it helps working people to maintain work life balance. The best example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby. People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours. For students too, studying from home is an attractive option. They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies. In a busy city like Tokyo, students waste a lot of time in travelling. Thus, the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home, are obvious.On the other hand, one part of the society, has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home. Many employers argue that once an employee works from isolation, he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues. This harms an employee's deliverable. Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly. Due to this they lag in their studies. These factors affect people who work or study from home.Following both the point of views, the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks. It is hoped that people will continue to use internet to work or study and improve on the disadvantages into the foreseeable future.;The debate over the advantages and disadvantages of working or studying from home remains a pertinent topic in contemporary society. While many embrace remote work and learning for the autonomy and flexibility it offers, others contend that this arrangement brings about significant drawbacks that can hinder productivity and the overall learning experience.Proponents of working or studying from home cite the ability to create a comfortable environment tailored to individual preferences. The elimination of daily commutes can also free up time for personal activities, enhancing work-life balance. Additionally, the flexibility to manage one's schedule allows for increased efficiency in completing tasks and assignments. However, this perceived advantage can quickly turn into a disadvantage as isolation may seep into work and study routines.Employers express concern that remote work can inhibit collaboration and effective communication among colleagues. When employees are isolated, much of their communication occurs via email or phone, potentially leading to misunderstandings and reduced responsiveness. This reliance on digital communication can hinder the quick exchange of ideas that often occurs in a traditional office setting. Consequently, the quality and timeliness of deliverables may suffer, impacting overall team productivity.Similarly, educators worry about the implications of remote learning on students' academic development. Virtual classrooms often lack the immediate feedback mechanisms of in-person lessons. Students may find it challenging to clarify their doubts and engage in spontaneous discussions with peers and teachers. This barrier can lead to gaps in understanding and detract from a comprehensive learning experience.In conclusion, while working or studying from home presents several advantages, it is essential to recognize the accompanying challenges. The risks of isolation, reduced collaboration, and limitations in communication can undermine the intended benefits of flexibility and autonomy. A balanced approach that incorporates aspects of both remote and traditional modalities may ultimately provide a more effective solution for employers and students alike.
358;International tourism has become the biggest industry in the world. Some people think it causes tension between people from different culture. Others think it leads to understanding between countries. To what extend do you agree or disagree?Ê;I agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture, because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates.There is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area. Firstly, some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions. Therefore, those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment. Moreover, tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background. For example, Indians don't eat beef since they worship cows. Thus, if tourists want to respect the tradition, they will not order any beef in the local restaurant. On the other hand, in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals, people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions. For instance, tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place. Furthermore, the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries. Thus, the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties.Obviously, people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism. Hence, I think international tourism leads to both tension and understanding between people from different culture.;"International tourism is often perceived through a dual lens; while it can lead to cultural tensions and misunderstandings, it also fosters dialogue and understanding among individuals from diverse backgrounds. The clash of cultures frequently emerges when tourists encounter local customs that differ significantly from their own. This can lead to frustration or miscommunication, especially if tourists inadvertently offend local practices or if locals feel overwhelmed by the presence of foreigners. Such tensions can spark debates over cultural norms, creating a fertile ground for conflict when expectations diverge.However, amidst these conflicts lies an opportunity for growth and understanding. When individuals from different cultures engage in conversations to resolve their differences, it often leads to a broader perspective and increased empathy. For instance, when tourists try to comprehend the reasoning behind a local tradition or participate respectfully in cultural events, they foster a deeper connection with the community. This exchange of ideas opens pathways for learning, allowing both tourists and locals to share their narratives, enriching each other’s experiences.Moreover, as more people from various backgrounds travel and interact, they contribute to a global dialogue that transcends geographical boundaries. These interactions encourage tourists to reflect on their own cultural assumptions while helping locals articulate their values and traditions. The result is not merely a series of transactions but a profound engagement that can bridge gaps and dismantle stereotypes.In essence, while international tourism can spark conflicts due to cultural differences, it also serves as a catalyst for meaningful exchanges that promote understanding and appreciation. As travelers seek to navigate the complexities of new cultures, they often emerge with a revised worldview, one that acknowledges the richness of diversity while celebrating common humanity. Thus, tourism can transform tension into transformative dialogue, highlighting the power of human connection in overcoming differences."
359;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do. While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation, this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs.It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public. For example, some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media, thereby gaining the public attention. If they continue to behave in such a way, it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work. Consequently, the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status. This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits. Nevertheless, I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments. Firstly, celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans. This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results. Therefore, this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance. Secondly, other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career. Take Michael Jackson as an example, his works are widely spread around the world, and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation. His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other, which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society. In summary, although some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance, other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction.;The perception of celebrities often revolves around their glamorous lifestyles, overshadowing the essence of their work and contributions to society. Indeed, many individuals in the public eye seem to prioritize showcasing their lavish lives through social media platforms and public appearances. This inclination towards exhibiting wealth, extravagant parties, and luxury brands can easily lead the younger generation to equate success with superficiality rather than the hard work and dedication behind the scenes.However, it would be an oversimplification to paint all celebrities with the same brush. While a subset of public figures might indulge in flaunting their glamour, there exists a substantial number of celebrities who utilize their fame to inspire and lead young people down a more productive path. Figures such as actors, musicians, and athletes often engage in philanthropic efforts, advocate for social causes, and serve as role models who encourage hard work, resilience, and authenticity.For instance, certain celebrities leverage their platforms to bring attention to issues such as mental health, environmental awareness, and education. They champion initiatives that seek to enact positive change, showing that fame can be an avenue for social responsibility. Furthermore, many celebrities share their personal stories of struggle and triumph, illustrating that success is not merely defined by wealth but by perseverance and passion for one’s craft.In conclusion, while the glamorous portrayal of celebrity life can dominate public perception, it is crucial to recognize the dual nature of celebrity influence. There are those who project a superficial image and those who genuinely strive to make a difference. Young people should be encouraged to distinguish between these influences, seeking out figures who inspire genuine motivation and embody the values of hard work, integrity, and social consciousness. This nuanced understanding can help cultivate a more positive and aspirational narrative surrounding celebrity culture.
360;Children can effectively learn from watching television. Therefore they should be encouraged to watch TV in both home and school. Agree/Disagree?;TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it. But I believe that by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth. If children spend too much time in front of TV, it will negatively impact their health and study.It is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information. There are international and local news channels like BBC, CNBC, Etv Gujarati, Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings. By watching TV, children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities. For example, Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly, sports events like cricket, football can teach leadership skills, team building skills, communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs.But on other hand, watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health. For example, they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood, and also develop back pain. Sometimes, students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences. Many times, students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels, or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades. In conclusion, I believe demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits and thus if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children.;Television has long been a powerful medium for information dissemination and entertainment. For students, it provides a vibrant platform to expand their knowledge and develop various skills. Educational programs, documentaries, and instructional content can cultivate curiosity, enhance critical thinking, and spark creativity. For instance, certain channels feature science experiments, historical reconstructions, and art tutorials that can complement traditional classroom learning, helping students grasp complex concepts in an engaging manner.However, the potential benefits of television must be weighed against the possible drawbacks of excessive viewing. Allowing students to watch TV both at school and at home can hinder their overall growth in several important ways. First and foremost, excessive screen time can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which is linked to health issues such as obesity and poor physical fitness. If students spend too many hours in front of a screen, they may miss out on vital physical activities that are essential for their physical and mental development.Furthermore, television can often serve as a distraction from academic responsibilities. When students are permitted to watch TV freely, they may prioritize entertainment over studying, leading to reduced academic performance. The time spent binge-watching shows or playing video games can take away from valuable hours that could be dedicated to reading, homework, or engaging in constructive social interaction.In addition, the content that students consume may not always be educational or appropriate. The influence of violent and sensational programming can shape attitudes and behaviors negatively, distracting students from positive role models and real-life experiences. In conclusion, while television can be a valuable educational tool, its unrestricted use within both the school and home environments can significantly impede students' overall development. Striking a balance between educational viewing and other enriching activities is essential to ensure that students can reap the benefits of television without falling prey to its potential pitfalls.
361;It has been claimed that workers over 50 are not responsive to rapidly changing ideas in the modern workplace and that for this reason younger workers are to be preferred. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Throughout human history, the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor. This is still true in the industrial society nowadays, where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers. There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace.First and foremost, old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm. The old were raised in poverty, probably caused by war, look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view. The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change, or more precisely, to accept the existence of such modernity. For example, most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human's capability.Secondly, their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life. In other words, that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology. This, by all means, is outweigh by youngsters' adventurousness and bravery. Blatantly seen, success of most companies stems from young people, whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment.Last but not least, knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly. Who would the employer choose, an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject, but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages. Not to undermine old workers, but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace.All in a nutshell, workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects. However, in my point of view, it is still of great importance to remain the harmonious coexistence of both sides for the smooth sailing of the company.;The ongoing debate regarding the productivity of older workers versus younger ones continues to garner attention in various professional sectors. Proponents of the younger demographic assert that older workers are “not a patch” on their younger counterparts, primarily due to an adherence to an unchanged paradigm that often hinders innovation and adaptability. This inflexible mindset can be largely attributed to a preference for monotony and a safe ideology, which makes it difficult for older employees to keep pace with the rapidly evolving landscape of today’s workplace.One significant factor that distinguishes younger workers is their innate drive for change and innovation. Young professionals are inherently more likely to embrace new technologies and methodologies, which are increasingly necessary for competitive success. In contrast, older workers may demonstrate an unresponsiveness to these advancements, opting instead for tried-and-true methods that may no longer yield favorable outcomes. This reluctance to adapt can be a liability in an age where staying ahead is synonymous with survival.Additionally, knowledge plays a pivotal role in empowering younger workers to surpass their older colleagues. With the advent of digital tools and resources, younger employees are often more adept at acquiring and applying contemporary knowledge, making them invaluable assets to organizations striving for growth. Their familiarity with the latest market trends, technologies, and cultural shifts enables them to harness innovative solutions that older workers may overlook or resist.In conclusion, while the experience of older workers should not be dismissed, it is essential to recognize the merits that younger workers bring to the table. An agile mindset, coupled with contemporary knowledge and a readiness to explore the unknown, poise younger professionals as the leaders of tomorrow. In a rapidly changing world, adaptability and innovative thinking are indispensable, making it clear why younger workers often outshine their older counterparts in modern workplaces.
362;The use of machines are increasing day by day which is reducing physical work done by humans. Do you think advantages outweigh the disadvantages ;Advancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades. This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days. These machines reduce the physical work done by humans. Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans.Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached.It is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people. For example, in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days. People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs. It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity. So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects.On other side of the coin, many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work. Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens. The work of chopping, blending, grating, kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes. Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome.After analyzing these two points of view, it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth. The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy. Therefore, it is hoped that in coming time people will enjoy using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay disease free.;The use of machines and technology in the workplace has generated a polarized debate regarding its impact on human health and productivity. On one hand, critics argue that the reliance on machines diminishes the physical activity necessary for maintaining good health. As machines take over tasks previously done by human labor, individuals become increasingly sedentary, leading to a rise in lifestyle-related health issues such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and musculoskeletal problems. The argument posits that, by decreasing physical exertion, machines contribute to a decline in overall health standards, making individuals more prone to chronic illnesses.Moreover, some people argue that machines can have adverse psychological effects. The mechanization of work can lead to alienation and a lack of fulfillment, as individuals may find their roles reduced to mere operation of machines, robbing them of a sense of purpose and achievement that comes from manual labor. This perception can contribute to workplace dissatisfaction and mental health issues.Conversely, proponents of machine usage assert that the integration of technology significantly enhances efficiency and productivity. Machines can perform repetitive and labor-intensive tasks more quickly and with greater precision, freeing human workers to focus on more complex and creative aspects of their jobs. This can lead to increased job satisfaction and a more engaging work environment, as employees are able to take on roles that require critical thinking and innovative solutions. Moreover, the time saved by using machines allows for more leisure, enabling individuals to engage in physical activities outside of work, which can positively impact health.In conclusion, the debate surrounding the use of machines in the workplace reflects a broader discussion about the balance between efficiency and health. While there are valid concerns regarding their impact on physical and mental well-being, the advantages of increased productivity and the potential for improved job satisfaction cannot be overlooked. A balanced approach, integrating both technology and health-conscious practices, may provide an optimal path forward for modern workplaces.
363;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;These days, most of countries on the world invest for technology. It is evident that technology promotes economy. Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated. I totally disagree this opinion.First of all, traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture. They make differences between countries. Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation, intelligence. Consequently, people feel pround of their country, so they keep reserving conventions. For example, ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries.In addition, in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology. Lot of people like to use traditional things because if their quality and durability. In paticular, vases are made by hand would be used more. Futhermore, there are plenty of works that using traditional way is unique method. For instance, making cone hats from leaves have to use hand. Not only because there is no machine for the work, but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand, so resulting in greater value economy.The last thing is about education. Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history. Methods which their ancestors used in the past will be displayed again for new generations. After that, they might create somethings that are useful for life.In conclusion, technology has brought many benefits, but traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever.;"In contemporary society, there is a growing sentiment among some individuals that conventional practices and methods should be disregarded or even eradicated. However, I firmly disagree with this perspective. Traditional skills and customs are integral components of cultural identity and heritage, which enrich our lives and foster a sense of belonging.First and foremost, traditional skills and practices are valuable aspects of cultural heritage that distinguish one nation from another. They embody the history, values, and beliefs of a people, often passed down through generations. These conventions provide a sense of continuity, connecting individuals to their ancestors and shaping their identity. For instance, culinary traditions, folk music, and craftsmanship are not merely ways of doing things; they are expressions of history and community. When we preserve these conventional practices, we celebrate our unique cultural narratives and foster a greater appreciation for the diversity that exists in our world.Moreover, traditional customs instill a sense of pride and belonging among individuals. When people engage in practices that reflect their cultural heritage, it strengthens their connection to their country and community. This pride often motivates individuals to safeguard their conventions, ensuring that future generations can access and appreciate their customs. For instance, festivals celebrating local culture, traditional clothing, and art forms provide opportunities for communities to come together and celebrate their shared identity, enhancing social cohesion.In conclusion, while the world continually evolves, it is essential to recognize the value of traditional practices and skills. They are not mere relics of the past but important elements that contribute to cultural richness and community pride. Rather than seeking to eliminate these conventions, we should actively work to preserve and celebrate them, ensuring that they remain a vibrant part of our collective identity."
364;The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots. The problem off traffic overload, caused by overpopulation, has aroused interest of many city planners. It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock. However, I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way.First of all, public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street. Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options. Apparently, a bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number. Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles. Together, they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays.Second, rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas. It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now. As a rule of thumb, huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities. The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people.In conclusion, city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas. It is highly recommended to put forward such solution, especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China, with the ever-growing demand for job or education.;In contemporary society, big cities have increasingly come to be described as melting pots, teeming with diverse cultures, ethnicities, and lifestyles that coexist within a shared urban space. This vibrant diversity fosters innovation and creativity, contributing to the economic and cultural richness of urban environments. However, with this influx of people seeking opportunities and a better quality of life, cities are grappling with significant challenges, the most pressing of which is traffic overload due to overpopulation.City planners are at the forefront of addressing the complications that arise from such congestion. As the number of vehicles on the road continues to soar, the quality of life for residents diminishes due to increased commute times, air pollution, and heightened stress levels. Consequently, there is a growing interest among urban planners in reimagining transportation systems. One promising solution is the promotion of non-personal vehicles, including public transportation options such as buses, subways, and trams. By enhancing the efficiency and convenience of these systems, planners can encourage residents to opt for public transit instead of relying on private cars, thereby alleviating traffic congestion.Additionally, city planners are exploring the exploitation of suburban areas as extensions of urban living. By developing infrastructure in suburbs and connecting them seamlessly to urban centers, planners can distribute population density more evenly, reducing the strain on inner-city resources. This approach not only mitigates traffic but also creates new economic opportunities and enhances the quality of life for suburban residents who may prefer a quieter lifestyle while retaining access to the amenities and employment opportunities afforded by the city.In conclusion, while big cities serve as melting pots of cultures and opportunities, they must evolve to address pressing challenges, most notably traffic overload. Through the promotion of non-personal vehicles and the thoughtful development of suburban areas, city planners can create sustainable urban environments that improve the quality of life for all residents.
365;Celebrities are usually famous for glamour and wealth rather than their achievements. Some say taking them as an example can be dangerous for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Young people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities. These celebrities are popular among younger generations because of their glamorous lifestyles. It is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth. This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors. First of all, it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents. Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age. For example, in a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes. This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals.Secondly, it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way. Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior. For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools. So, this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people.Thus to conclude, it can be said that when young people follow celebrities, it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way. This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual. Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly, rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future.;"In the digital age, young people across the globe are increasingly influenced by media and celebrities. The allure of fame, coupled with the omnipresent nature of social media, creates an environment where idolizing celebrities is not just common but often expected. While this phenomenon can inspire aspiration, it is widely agreed that emulating celebrities can pose significant dangers for youth, ultimately affecting their health and personality.First, the health implications of following celebrities can be alarming. Many public figures, particularly in the entertainment industry, promote unrealistic body images and lifestyles that are both unattainable and unhealthy. From fad diets to excessive exercise regimens, young people are susceptible to adopting drastic measures in a bid to mirror their idols. This often leads to eating disorders, mental health issues such as anxiety and depression, and a distorted body image. Young individuals, still forming their self-identities, may perceive these celebrity-endorsed standards as the norm, neglecting their well-being in the process.Moreover, the influence of celebrities extends beyond physical health; it significantly impacts the personality development of youth. Celebrities often glamorize behavior that is imprudent or deviant, ranging from substance abuse to reckless lifestyle choices. For impressionable minds, these portrayals can normalize dangerous habits that deviate from healthy social norms. Consequently, young individuals may adopt attitudes and behaviors that contrast sharply with those of their peers, leading to social isolation and conflicts with foundational values.In conclusion, while the influence of media and celebrities can offer entertainment and inspiration, it bears inherent risks for young people. By critically examining the effects on health and personality, it becomes evident that idolizing celebrities can be hazardous—prompting a need for greater awareness, responsible media consumption, and positive role models to guide the youth in a healthier direction."
366;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The gender issues have been already discussing for many years in order to give solutions for realising the equal proportion of developing human resources. Implementing the statue and right of equal education are believed as a sustainable policy that should be held. Nowadays, there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course. I strongly agree about this statement.The proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently. Automatically, the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people. We can see now that women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers, and dealing with machines. Those activities have proven that women can also do the men's works. Therefore, female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men.Another reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person's career. These days, it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities. So, learning from human's history, education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college. According to this opinion, giving equal education for both men and women is a must.In conclusion, the needs for having developed-skills and gaining degree certificate in order to build someone's career are totally needed to implement and applied for any gender. As the world's situation is always changing, act for distributing education needs are absolutely important to compete the future challenges.;"Gender issues have been a significant topic of discussion for decades as societies strive to achieve equality in various aspects of life, particularly in education and employment. The pursuit of gender equality is crucial for the realization of human resources and the development of societies as a whole. Historically, many women faced barriers in accessing education and professional opportunities, leading to a disproportionate representation in fields of study and careers. However, ongoing discussions and advocacy for gender equality have prompted a gradual shift toward inclusivity.In recent years, many educational institutions have adopted policies aimed at promoting gender parity. A notable trend is the acceptance of an equal average number of male and female students across various courses. This proactive approach acknowledges the importance of diverse perspectives in learning environments and the workforce. As a result, women are increasingly pursuing higher education and entering fields traditionally dominated by men, such as STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), business, and politics.The rising proportion of women in education is not merely a statistic; it reflects a broader socio-cultural transformation. Many regions around the world are witnessing a steady increase in female enrollment in universities and vocational programs. This increase is indicative of shifting mindsets, where both families and societies increasingly value the education of women and recognize their potential contributions to economic and social growth.Nevertheless, the journey toward complete gender equality remains ongoing. While advancements are visible, structural barriers and societal biases still persist in certain contexts. Ongoing advocacy, policy implementation, and community engagement will be essential in ensuring that the trend toward equal representation continues. Ultimately, empowering women through education and professional opportunities is not only a matter of justice; it is crucial for the sustainable development of any society."
367;It has been proved that smoking kills. In some countries it has been made illegal for people to smoke in all public places except in certain areas. All countries should make these rules. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;People the world over have designated smoothing as a shameful practice and a lethal habit. Several millions of smokers die suffering from cancers such as lung and oral. This bad habit also responsible for causing health hazards to passive-smokers: who are around smoking is taken place. Thus, it is argued that smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations. This position will be proven by looking at how this arrangement has benefited both general public as well as smokers.To start, non-smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain. Prior to 1980's public places in Sri Lanka, illustrates unpleasant situation where people smoked freely. Even in public transportation they engaged in this intolerant bad habit, some instances that lead to belligerent incidents. After enforcing restrictions the situation came to control and this act as benefit rendered to the public.In addition to this, introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing. For instance, further enforcement banned smoking in capital in Sri Lanka has reduced this consumption related diseases and deaths, as per the ministry of health. As this shows, smoking restrictions has successfully daunted public from this bad puffing that put less strain on country's healthcare systems.After analyzing smoke illegalization in public places in Sri Lanka, it has been proven benefits people enjoy this arrangement. It is thus hoped governments would consider smoke banning in public places following footsteps of Sri Lanka as well as many other countries.;Smoking has long been recognized as a harmful practice, not only for those who indulge in the habit but also for innocent bystanders, often referred to as passive smokers. The societal consensus about smoking has shifted over the years, designating it as a shameful practice that leads to severe health risks and negative social implications. With the volume of evidence supporting the dangers of tobacco, there is a growing call for stricter regulations, particularly the prohibition of smoking in public places such as bus and railway stations.The health hazards associated with smoking are well-documented. Smokers expose themselves to a range of serious medical conditions, including lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory issues. However, passive smokers—those who inhale secondhand smoke—are equally at risk. Research reveals that non-smokers in close proximity to smokers suffer from increased health disorders, including an elevated risk of heart disease and respiratory complications. This creates a compelling argument for banning smoking in public spaces where large groups congregate.Public transport hubs like bus and railway stations are often crowded, and the presence of smokers in such areas exacerbates the exposure of non-smokers to harmful tobacco smoke. Instituting a smoking ban in these locations would demonstrate a commitment to public health and safety, as well as promote a culture where smoking is less tolerated. In conclusion, the argument for prohibiting smoking in public places is grounded in the need to protect both smokers and non-smokers. It reflects a societal shift towards prioritizing health over outdated norms surrounding tobacco use. By enacting such measures, communities can create a cleaner, healthier environment while also reducing the stigma associated with smoking, ultimately supporting public well-being.
368;Tourism is a modern form of colonialism. It distorts local economies, causes environmental damage and ruins the places it exploits. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Tourism, since its first appearance a long time ago, can be described as a controversial celebrity. Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion, environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places. However, I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons.First of all, tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be. Basically, places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas, of which economy, before their appearance, haven't blossmed yet. Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up. It will, by all means, attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents. In other word, tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction, which exploit the best out of its own potential.Secondly, even though environmental damage is inevitable, it is not tourism to be blamed for. In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction, the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration. To be precise, for instance, a fortune is spent on trimming the trees, watering the flowers, preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora, in the hope of beautifying the wild. Not to mention ecotourism, a new kind of environment-friendly service, which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures. Because of that, tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity.All thing considered, tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact. In my opinion, the combination of tourism and teaching process is highly recommended in pursuit of a harmonial relationship between human and their surroundings.;Tourism is often seen as a double-edged sword, offering significant economic benefits while simultaneously posing considerable threats to the environments and cultures it touches. Critics argue that tourism leads to domestic economic distortion, as local economies become overly reliant on the fluctuations of tourist spending. Moreover, the influx of visitors can result in environmental degradation, with natural habitats suffering from overexploitation and waste. Destinations frequently become overcrowded, leading to devastating consequences for ecosystems and eroding the unique characteristics that attract tourists in the first place.However, I contend that a well-planned integration of tourism and education can mitigate these adverse effects and foster a more sustainable approach. By incorporating educational elements into the tourist experience, visitors can develop a deeper understanding of the local environment and culture. For instance, eco-tourism initiatives often include guided tours that emphasize conservation and the importance of protecting natural resources. This educational aspect encourages tourists to engage more thoughtfully with their surroundings, promoting a sense of responsibility and stewardship.Furthermore, teaching locals about sustainable practices in tourism can empower communities to maximize benefits while minimizing harm. When local stakeholders are educated about eco-friendly tourism practices, they can develop strategies that balance economic gains with environmental preservation. This approach not only protects the physical landscape but also enhances the cultural experience for tourists, creating richer interactions between people and places.Ultimately, the combination of tourism and education is crucial in fostering a harmonious relationship between humans and their environment. By prioritizing responsible practices and emphasizing the importance of sustainability, we can transform tourism from a potential threat into a powerful vehicle for positive change. This holistic approach may very well lead to the preservation of our planet's treasures while supporting local economies and cultures.
369;In the last 20 years there have been significant development in the field of information technology (IT), for example the World Wide Web and communication by e-mail. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;The appearance of information technology (IT) in the last 20 years has brought about significant developments in life standard as well as work efficiency. However, it is believed that the evolution also proves to be detrimental. In my opinion, there is a likelihood that future developments in IT will put the users at their own expense.With the rapid developing pace, IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves. In the past, there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail, but the cyber world now varies form games, online TV shows to means of communication, and probably still keeps going. Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones, resulting in their dependence on technical equipment. What is more, the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict, therefore, staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative.Future IT has also aroused concern on health issues. The existence of Skype, Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click. As a result, rarely do people go out of their comfot zone, provided with snack and air conditioner, to assemble with others in flesh. Needless to say, their action will make a beeline for obesity, short-sighted, diabetes and other heart-related problems.In conclusion, despite the contribution of IT to the society, its effect on the users' independence and prositution should not be out of concern. To my mind, there have to be some alterations before IT has more serious impact on each individual's life.;"Over the past two decades, the advent of information technology (IT) has catalyzed unprecedented transformations across various facets of life. These technological advancements, characterized by the proliferation of personal computing devices, the internet, and mobile applications, have significantly elevated living standards and enhanced work efficiency. Individuals now enjoy instantaneous access to vast reservoirs of information, which empowers them to make more informed decisions while businesses harness IT to streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve customer service. Indeed, the integration of IT into everyday activities has cultivated a digitally interconnected society, fostering opportunities for innovation and productivity that were previously unimaginable.However, despite these positive developments, there exists a growing concern regarding the darker side of this rapid evolution. Many observers argue that the very technology designed to empower users has, in many ways, ensnared them, rendering them as mere slaves to their devices. The addictive nature of smartphones and social media has led to an erosion of personal boundaries; many find themselves constantly tethered to their screens, unable to disengage from the digital realm. This phenomenon is further compounded by the culture of urgency fostered by instant communication, leading to increased stress levels and diminished quality of life.Moreover, the workplace dynamics have shifted dramatically due to pervasive IT presence. While remote work and connectivity can augment productivity, it is often accompanied by the expectation of constant availability, blurring the lines between professional and personal time. As a result, employees frequently face burnout, struggling to manage the incessant demands of an always-on work culture.In conclusion, while the advancements in information technology have undoubtedly enhanced our lifestyles and work efficiency, this rapid evolution comes at a cost. As users become more reliant on technology, they risk losing autonomy over their time and well-being. Recognizing and addressing these challenges is essential to ensuring that IT serves as a tool for empowerment rather than a source of enslavement."
370;An increasing number of people are turning to vegetarianism. some belive that people are following a vegetarian diet for reasons other than animal rights issues. Do you agree with this? Give reasons why some people are choosing to become vegetarian;Since the dawn of time, human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources. Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family's meals all around the world. Recent years, however, has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians. Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue, others think it is much beyond that. It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect.Firstly, health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular. Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer. This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health. Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake, it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources.Secondy, relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet. Some religion, such as Buddha, believes that animals were human being in their previous life, so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings. It is often said that this view is rather unscientific. However, I am convinced that it is vital to follow one's own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind.To sum up, it is evident for me that people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals. However, a meal which is nutritionally balanced is always most recommended.;In recent years, there has been a remarkable increase in the number of individuals adopting vegetarian diets worldwide. This shift can largely be attributed to growing awareness of health benefits associated with vegetarianism, as well as the influence of religious beliefs. As people become more conscious of their health and its impact on overall well-being, the appeal of a plant-based diet has surged.The primary reason behind the growing popularity of vegetarianism is the improvement in health outcomes that many associate with such a diet. Numerous studies have demonstrated the positive effects of vegetarian eating patterns on reducing the risk of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Many individuals find that a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains can lead to weight loss, enhanced energy levels, and improved digestion. Moreover, the increasing alarm surrounding issues like obesity and nutritional deficiencies has compelled individuals to consider more wholesome dietary choices, with vegetarianism often seen as a viable solution.In addition to health considerations, religious beliefs play a significant role in the decision to adopt a vegetarian lifestyle. Many religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, and certain factions of Christianity, advocate for vegetarianism as a means to uphold the principle of non-violence towards living beings and promote compassion. Followers of these faiths often choose plant-based diets as a reflection of their spiritual values, further contributing to the rise of vegetarianism in various communities.In conclusion, the rapid increase in the number of vegetarians in recent years can be attributed primarily to health improvements associated with a vegetarian diet and the influence of religious beliefs. As individuals strive for healthier lifestyles and seek to align their diets with their convictions, the vegetarian movement is poised to continue its growth, shaping dietary trends and influencing food cultures around the globe.
371;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;There is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles. It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions, and there is no need to maintain them. However, from my point of view, what can be expected, is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society.It is undeniable that the country's culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life. For instance, in Vietnam, many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities, are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts. This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor's early life through books and images, which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed.In tradition, a person should look back at the past, mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle, to progress. Understanding why, and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today. Also, study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing.To sumarize, there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life. They are the ones that teach, and will teach us to be self-esteem and experienced, which means their preservation throughout history deserve our attention.;The advent of technological developments in various countries has undeniably ushered in modern skills and lifestyles that reshape the very fabric of society. Innovations in communication, transportation, and education have transformed how individuals interact and learn, facilitating an unparalleled exchange of ideas and cultures. While it is true that these advancements may seem to overshadow traditional practices, I posit that what we will observe is not the complete disappearance of tradition but rather a change in its role within society.Traditions are deeply ingrained cultural practices that offer a sense of identity and continuity. In many societies, these practices encompass values, rituals, and customs that have been passed down through generations. As technology proliferates, the mediums through which these traditions are shared may evolve, but the essence of the traditions themselves remains intact. For instance, traditional crafts may find new life through online platforms, allowing artisans to reach global audiences while preserving their ancestral techniques. Furthermore, technology can act as a bridge between generations, enabling older individuals to share their knowledge and skills with the youth in innovative ways. Virtual platforms can facilitate storytelling sessions or cultural exchanges that maintain the relevance of traditional narratives amidst modern contexts. As society navigates the complexities of a digitized world, empowering younger generations to engage with their heritage can foster a sense of pride and responsibility.Therefore, instead of viewing technological advancements and tradition as opposing forces, it is more constructive to see them as complementary. Technology can enrich and rejuvenate traditional practices, allowing them to adapt and resonate within contemporary lifestyles. Ultimately, the role of tradition may change, but its significance in fostering community, identity, and continuity is likely to endure, weaving itself into the evolving tapestry of society.
373;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;For a long time, the zoo has been a second home to endangered animals. However, other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing. In my opinion, the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons.First of all, the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners. With zoos, pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of, for instance, a lion or a crocodile. At a higher level, it is of university students' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings, which otherwise would not be at hand. This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels.Secondly, the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection. Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats, which consequently calls for the help of zoos. What is more, the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species. Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as: giraffe, panda, koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory.In sum, the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable. It is highly recommended that zoos should be seen with different perspective in order to function at their most efficiency.;Zoos have long been a topic of debate, often viewed through the lens of animal ethics and conservation. However, they also serve an essential educational purpose, particularly when it comes to providing real and vivid materials for learners. These institutions offer a unique opportunity for individuals, especially university students, to engage with living examples of biodiversity and animal behavior. By facilitating direct observations and interactions with various species, zoos create an environment conducive to experiential learning, enriching the educational process.For university students pursuing degrees in biology, zoology, or environmental science, zoos can be invaluable resources. They provide access to live animals, which allows students to conduct biological research rooted in practical statistics and real-time observations. Unlike traditional classroom settings where theoretical knowledge is paramount, the ability to study animals in their habitats within a controlled environment enables students to gather data that would otherwise be inaccessible. This hands-on approach fosters a deeper understanding of ecological principles, animal behavior, and conservation efforts.Additionally, amidst the process of globalization, natural habitats are increasingly encroached upon, leading to habitat destruction and endangerment of species worldwide. The ramifications of urbanization, industrialization, and agriculture significantly threaten wildlife. In this context, zoos take on an additional role as custodians of species that may no longer be present in their natural environments. They can raise awareness about the threats posed by human activities and the importance of conservation efforts. By educating students and the public about these issues, zoos can inspire future generations to advocate for responsible environmental stewardship.In conclusion, zoos are paramount educational resources that provide university students with opportunities for biological research and practical engagement with biodiversity. As we face the challenges of globalization and habitat destruction, their role as educational and conservation entities becomes more vital than ever.
374;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion?;"It is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one. I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken, every language should be protected from being disappeared.There are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages, it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them. For example, some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese, so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers, facilities and appropriate materials. Secondly, it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication, trade, cooperation as well as transaction, it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only.Despite of the above arguments, i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages. This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication. In addition, forming a language must be undergone thousands of years; thus, it deserves to be respected and preserved. Last but not least, language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world. Therefore, saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity's preservation.In conclusion, although letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial, it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages.";"The preservation of minority languages is a critical concern in our increasingly globalized world. Despite the arguments posited by those who advocate for prioritizing dominant languages, I strongly believe that government efforts to preserve minority languages are essential for upholding cultural diversity and historical heritage. The process of language formation is not a mere coincidence; it is a culmination of thousands of years of evolution, shaped by the experiences, traditions, and identities of the communities that speak them. Each minority language is imbued with its own unique expressions, idioms, and nuances, reflecting the rich tapestry of human thought and creativity.Language is not merely a tool for communication; it is a fundamental factor that contributes to the distinctiveness of cultures around the globe. Each language carries with it a unique worldview, influencing how its speakers understand and interact with their environment. When languages fade away, we lose invaluable cultural insights and perspectives. Furthermore, minority languages often encapsulate indigenous knowledge and ecological wisdom that are critical for sustainable living and biodiversity conservation.The consequences of language loss extend beyond mere communication. The disappearance of a language can result in the erosion of cultural identities, impacting the self-esteem and social cohesion of its speakers. When governments prioritize the preservation of minority languages, they not only celebrate the diversity of their populace but also foster an inclusive society where all voices are heard and valued.In conclusion, the preservation of minority languages merits proactive efforts from governments worldwide. It is vital to recognize that each language represents a vital piece of our global heritage, deserving both respect and protection. By investing in the promotion of minority languages, we safeguard the histories and identities that enrich our shared human experience, paving the way for a more inclusive and culturally vibrant future."
375;Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagreee with this statement?;"There has always been a saying in medicine: ""Prevention is better than cure"". This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health-protected measures. In my opinion, this plan should be put into practice for the two reasons mentioned accordingly.No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness. Children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones, thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle. What is more, it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of, for instance, not consuming too much fast food, over-fried food or intoxicants.In addition, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases. Needless to say, such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years. Similarly, if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance.To sum up, I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures. This will yield positive results on not only the people's physical and mental development but also their finance.";"The adage ""prevention is better than cure"" encapsulates a fundamental principle in medicine and public health. This saying underscores the importance of taking proactive measures to avoid illness rather than dealing with its consequences after the fact. By focusing on prevention, we not only protect individuals’ health but also create significant economic benefits for society at large. Investing in preventative healthcare measures, such as vaccination programs, health education, and early detection screenings, demonstrates a clear return on investment. It is often far less expensive to prevent diseases than to treat them once they manifest. For instance, chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease can be mitigated through lifestyle changes, which ultimately reduce the financial burden on healthcare systems. Thus, by promoting preventative strategies, governments and societies can allocate resources more efficiently, leading to improved overall health outcomes and economic stability.Moreover, the education of children regarding balanced diets and the nutritional value of food is paramount in this context. Young individuals should be equipped with knowledge about what constitutes a healthy meal, emphasizing the importance of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and proteins while also highlighting the dangers of excessive sugar, salt, and processed foods. This kind of nutritional education not only fosters healthier eating habits but also empowers children to make informed decisions that will benefit their long-term health.When children understand the impacts of their dietary choices, they are more likely to adopt these healthy behaviors into adulthood. Over time, these habits can lead to a decline in preventable diseases and foster a healthier population. Education serves as a crucial tool in promoting a holistic approach to health that prioritizes prevention, ultimately proving that indeed, prevention is better than cure."
376;University education should be restricted to the very besst academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;The pursuit of higher education has always been a significant milestone for outstanding academic students, who often receive admission to universities due to their exceptional intellectual abilities. These students typically possess a strong aptitude for critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical reasoning. However, the value of a university education extends far beyond academic prowess. It serves as a nurturing ground for artistic talent and the development of essential soft skills that are increasingly valued in today's dynamic job market.Academically gifted students contribute richly to university life, often engaging in rigorous coursework and research projects that propel knowledge forward. Yet, the university experience is not solely defined by scholarly achievements. Many institutions encourage students to explore their creative sides, offering programs in the arts, music, and performance. These opportunities allow students to cultivate their artistic talents, providing a balanced educational experience that embraces diverse forms of intelligence. Engaging in creative pursuits fosters innovation and generates a broader perspective—skills that are indispensable in various professional fields.Moreover, universities play a crucial role in developing soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and leadership. These abilities are essential in today’s increasingly interconnected world, where collaboration and interpersonal relations are key components of success. Participating in extracurricular activities, group projects, and campus organizations enables students to hone these skills in real-world contexts, preparing them for challenges that lie ahead.In conclusion, while the admission restrictions enforced by universities based on academic performance have their advantages—ensuring that intellectually capable students are prioritized—they also present downsides. These policies may inadvertently limit access to higher education for talented individuals who excel in non-academic areas. Thus, it is essential to find a balance that appreciates both academic excellence and diverse talents, allowing for a more inclusive approach to higher education. By doing so, universities can foster well-rounded individuals prepared to contribute meaningfully to society.
377;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answerÊ;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children's education. Indeed, children grow up with two important people, their parents and teachers, and both are important in children's development. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects. In the first place, school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education. For instance, to be able to obtain the teacher certificates, people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge. However, in comparison to teachers, parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children's subjects such as mathematics and physics.Furthermore, teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children's communication skills. For example, after many years of teaching experience, teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries, facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills. By contrast, parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way. Last but not least, compared with teachers, parents do not have enough time to spend with their children. Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work, hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children. Thus, it was impossible for them to be a good teacher.In conclusion, teachers are the best for children's education. Not only do they contribute much to children's professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world.;Children grow up surrounded by influential figures, predominantly their parents and teachers. While both play crucial roles in a child's development, I believe that teachers can often provide a unique advantage in certain aspects of education and personal growth.One significant area where teachers excel is their specialized knowledge and expertise. Educators are trained professionals who possess a deep understanding of various subjects and pedagogical methods. This enables them to present complex concepts in a structured and comprehensible manner, fostering a love for learning. Parents, despite their best intentions, may lack the familiarity with academic material required to effectively assist children in their studies, particularly as they progress to higher levels of education.Moreover, teachers serve as role models and mentors, helping to shape a child’s character and social skills. In a school environment, children engage with their peers and learn essential life skills such as collaboration, communication, and conflict resolution. This exposure often helps them develop resilience and adaptability, qualities that are indispensable in today's fast-paced world. Teachers create a structured and supportive atmosphere, encouraging students to express their thoughts and challenge themselves. In contrast, the home environment may not always provide such opportunities for diverse interactions.Additionally, teachers play a vital role in identifying and nurturing individual talents and interests. Through various assessments and observations, they can recognize students' strengths, offering tailored guidance that helps cultivate their abilities. In this way, teachers can ignite a passion for learning that parents may not always be equipped to inspire.In conclusion, while parents undoubtedly have a profound impact on children's early development, teachers emerge as pivotal figures in shaping their educational journeys. Their expertise, ability to foster social skills, and capacity to nurture individual potential make them invaluable in the quest for knowledge and personal growth.
378;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the increasing physical demands of human life, salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone. I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job. In the following paragraphs, some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively.On one hand, i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human' basic needs. More specifically, people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family's living needs such as food , clothes, accommodation, education, medication. It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries, for example, will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably. This is because they are doing what they love, their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths.On the other hand, i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working, we are likely to achieve success easily in that field. There are plenty of people, who are now really successful, have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers, dancers and painters. Besides, important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness, satisfaction of jobs, personal relationships, professional skills, working environment, managers and colleagues should not be underestimated. Finally, some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies.In conclusion, it is undeniable that income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers. Nonetheless, passion on jobs, in my opinion, can bring actual happiness and help us get promoted in working to earn even more money later on.;In today’s fast-paced society, salary has undeniably emerged as a primary factor influencing career choices. Many individuals often gravitate toward positions that promise lucrative compensation, associating financial stability with personal success and happiness. While it is true that a satisfactory income is vital for meeting basic human needs—such as food, shelter, and security—there exists a myriad of other factors that should be considered equally important when defining a career.Firstly, job satisfaction plays a crucial role in a person's overall well-being. Engaging in work that aligns with one’s passions and interests can lead to a more fulfilling life. For instance, a highly paid job in a field that one finds uninteresting or morally conflicting may lead to dissatisfaction and burnout. Conversely, a position that pays less but allows for creativity, innovation, and contribution to a cause can be more rewarding in the long run.Secondly, workplace environment and culture significantly affect an employee’s happiness and productivity. A supportive team, opportunities for professional development, and a healthy work-life balance can make a significant difference in job satisfaction. Employees often thrive in environments that empower them, foster collaboration, and encourage personal growth. Thus, a toxic work atmosphere, even with high pay, may lead to stress and ultimately prompt one to seek more suitable employment options.Moreover, job security and opportunities for advancement must not be overlooked. In a competitive job market, knowing that one has a stable position with prospects for growth often outweighs the allure of a higher initial salary. In conclusion, while salary is an essential aspect to consider when choosing a career, it is imperative to recognize that job satisfaction, workplace environment, and opportunities for growth are equally, if not more, important in leading a fulfilling professional life. Ultimately, a well-rounded approach to career decision-making will likely result in greater long-term happiness and success.
379;The burning of oil for transportation, especially in private cars, is wasteful and environmentally irresponsible. Taxation on petrol and diesel fuel should be increased to very high levels to discourage the use of private cars. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;There is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced. However, cars themselves, especially private ones, have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption. While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion.One can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile. Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries. Additionally, for those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities.However, taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation. To be precise, the more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable. Consequently, people have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis.Another point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially. Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support, other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them. America, for example, has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil.To summarize, higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons. However, it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues, making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars.;The advent of automobiles has revolutionized transportation, bringing economic benefits and increased mobility. However, this innovation comes at a considerable cost, particularly to the environment and the economy. The heavy reliance on cars has led to significant environmental degradation, chiefly due to wasteful oil consumption. As vehicles generate considerable greenhouse gas emissions, they contribute heavily to climate change, exacerbating natural disasters and altering ecological systems. Moreover, fluctuations in oil prices profoundly affect the economy. While petrol is a crucial commodity for driving economies, higher fuel costs directly translate into increased prices for essential goods such as rice, meat, and vegetables. Farmers incur higher transportation costs while agricultural inputs become pricier, leading consumers to face inflated prices at grocery stores. This cascading effect places a disproportionate burden on low-income families who spend a larger percentage of their income on basic necessities. Furthermore, nations that rely heavily on imported oil become politically and financially dependent on exporting countries. This dependency can lead to vulnerabilities in national security, as fluctuating oil prices often intertwine with geopolitical tensions. For instance, countries reliant on oil imports may find themselves constrained in their foreign policy choices, forced to maintain favorable relations with oil-rich nations, even when it may not align with their interests or values.Thus, while cars have facilitated individual mobility and economic expansion, they have simultaneously exerted severe pressure on the environment and compounded economic challenges. Addressing these issues requires a multifaceted approach, including investing in alternative energy sources, promoting public transportation, and adopting more sustainable practices. Only by re-evaluating our dependence on oil can we pave the way for a more sustainable future.
380;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society. I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs.First of all, we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself. As a result, criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs. Thus, citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally. Moreover, while on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns. Therefore, a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one.Secondly, police force carries guns only in high crime societies. Hence, people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime's categories such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, arson. Obviously, Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence.In conclusion, from the above views, although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary, it will bring the higher level of violence. Additionally, the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians' lives.;"The rising incidence of street crime in many urban areas has prompted an alarming response from law enforcement agencies: the increased arming of police officers. This trend towards heightened militarization within the police force has sparked significant debate and concern among the populace. For some, it embodies a vicious cycle of violence that exacerbates societal tensions rather than mitigates them.One of the primary reasons that individuals perceive this trend as a reflection of escalating violence is rooted in public perception. As crime rates rise, often sensationalized by media coverage, the fear of criminal activity proliferates. Consequently, the response from police is to equip officers with more advanced weaponry, fostering an image of an increasingly unstable society. Critics argue that this approach may cultivate an atmosphere of fear and aggression, where routine interactions between civilians and law enforcement can turn confrontational, further spiraling into violent encounters.Furthermore, the presence of firearms among police officers can inadvertently instigate a psychological shift in community relations. When citizens perceive law enforcement as militarized entities rather than community protectors, trust diminishes. This estrangement can result in a reluctance to engage with police, potentially leading to an increase in crime as tension mounts on both sides. Instead of viewing police as allies, individuals may regard them as threats, thereby challenging social cohesion and cooperation.Moreover, the normalization of firearms within police work alters the narrative surrounding conflict resolution. When officers are armed, the threshold for using lethal force becomes lower, which can escalate situations that might otherwise have been de-escalated through dialogue or non-lethal means. The cycle of violence is self-perpetuating; as police become more armed, so do criminals, leading to an arms race that ultimately harms society.In conclusion, the rise in street crime has led to a reactionary trend of arming police, which many argue embeds and enhances violence within society. This complex issue requires thoughtful consideration, as fostering trust and understanding between law enforcement and communities is crucial for achieving long-term safety and stability."
381;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? With the help of technology, students nowadays can learn more information and learn it more quickly. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life. In education, it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances. From my viewpoint, the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students' progress.To start with, since technology was introduced, student have been exposed to a wide range of information, which neccessarily broaden their minds. The internet, for example, provide knowledge in the form of news, radio talks, tapes or reseachs on any particular fields. There, the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide.Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning. The modern world provides learners with the mp3, the mobile phone or the laptop that help them, especially language learners, listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime. Therefore, students will develop their skills at a greater pace. Moreover, the internet again, is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids, such as educational games, sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly.On balance, I have to consent to the use of technology in education, as it expedites data availability and accelarates students' learning process. It is highly recommended that apart from education, technology should be applied in every aspect of life which assures of a better future.;In today's educational landscape, technology plays a pivotal role in enhancing students' academic performance. Many educators and researchers assert that integrating technology into the classroom can significantly boost educational outcomes. From my perspective, two key factors contribute to this phenomenon: the richness of resources technology provides and the convenience it offers students in their learning processes.Firstly, technology presents a vast array of educational resources that cater to diverse learning styles. Online platforms, educational apps, and interactive tools offer students access to comprehensive information beyond traditional textbooks. For instance, programs like Khan Academy and Duolingo allow learners to grasp complex subjects at their own pace while making the learning experience more engaging and enjoyable. This wealth of resources fosters a deeper understanding of the material, aiding students in mastering challenging concepts that they might struggle with in a conventional setting. Furthermore, the availability of multimedia resources—such as videos, podcasts, and simulations—enables students to visualize and contextualize information, making learning more effective.Secondly, the convenience that technology confers cannot be overstated. With the advent of mobile devices and internet connectivity, students can access educational content anytime and anywhere. This flexibility empowers learners to take charge of their education, allowing them to study on their own schedules. For example, students can review lectures, participate in online discussions, or collaborate on group projects from the comfort of their homes. Moreover, technology facilitates instant feedback through various online assessments, enabling students to identify and address their weaknesses promptly.In conclusion, the richness and convenience of technology are two fundamental factors that significantly enhance students' scholarly performances. By providing plentiful resources and facilitating flexible learning environments, technology equips students with the tools necessary to succeed academically in an increasingly competitive world. Embracing these advancements in education is crucial for fostering a generation of proactive and knowledgeable learners.
382;Human have made a great technological process in the last hundred years. However, this progress has negative effects on people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;It is undeniable that technological process has brought numerous benefits making human life become more and more comfortable and easy. Some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives. I personally disagree with this view. In the following paragraphs, both sides of the above matter as well as my own view's explanations would be analyzed and given, respectively.Firstly, it is undoubtedly that thanks to modern technology invented recently, human life has been improved dramatically. Air-conditioners, computers, cellphones, washing machines, for example, is likely to be seen as greatest inventions helping people to reduce stress and time for other activities. Moreover, applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients' lives.However, some negative aspects of technological process need to be mentioned clearly. In spite of bring fantastic advantages, technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process. This is because exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously. Last but not least, technology may decrease a great deal of creativity in certain groups of people especially children and the youth due to the dependence upon available achievements.In conclusion, I totally believe that technology has a great contribution to our lives and civilization. We can not neglect profound impact of great technological process on human life. Nonetheless, its adverse effects need controlling more reasonably.;Technological development has dramatically transformed the landscape of our daily lives over the past few decades. While some individuals argue that these advancements come with numerous drawbacks that significantly impact our lives negatively, I personally disagree with this viewpoint. In this essay, I will explore both perspectives and outline my rationale for embracing the benefits of technology.Proponents of the idea that technology has adverse effects often cite issues such as diminished face-to-face interactions, increased distractions, and an overreliance on digital devices. They argue that the prevalence of smartphones and social media has led to a decline in traditional communication skills and meaningful relationships. Furthermore, concerns regarding mental health issues, stemming from cyberbullying and the pressure to maintain an online presence, have been widely discussed in recent years. Critics contend that these factors contribute to feelings of isolation and anxiety, which can severely impact individuals' well-being.However, it is essential to recognize the positive aspects of technological development that significantly outweigh its drawbacks. Technology has enhanced communication by enabling instant connectivity across the globe. Families and friends separated by long distances can maintain closer relationships through video calls and messaging applications. Additionally, the advancements in technology in various fields such as healthcare, education, and transportation have led to improved efficiency and accessibility. Online learning platforms have democratized access to quality education, reaching a broader audience than ever before. Similarly, telemedicine has revolutionized healthcare, allowing patients to receive medical advice from the comfort of their homes.In conclusion, while it is important to acknowledge the concerns surrounding technological advancements, I believe the benefits significantly surpass the drawbacks. Technology has not only transformed the way we connect but has also improved various aspects of our lives. By embracing these innovations and utilizing them responsibly, we can create a future that harnesses the power of technology for the greater good.
383;There is a large amount of violence in television programs we should reduce. Do you agree or disagree?;"Excessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society. Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today. Personally, I believe that governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable. Admittedly, reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate. However, in order to tackle this problem more effectively, governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children’s television programs. As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. Little wonder, then, that by watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes. Therefore, it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies.Nevertheless, it would certainly be a violation of adults’ civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences. Frequently, adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day. For whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment. Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them. In conclusion, it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency; however, the adults should not be the victim of this policy.";The impact of violent content in children's television programs is a pressing concern for parents and educators alike. To address this pressing issue more effectively, it is imperative that governments take a stand by prohibiting any forms of violent content in all children’s programming. This action is essential, given the mental immaturity of most young viewers, who often struggle to distinguish right from wrong. Their cognitive development is still underway, making them particularly susceptible to the influences of aggressive behavior portrayed on screen. Research has consistently shown that exposure to media violence can lead to desensitization, increased aggressiveness, and even the normalization of violent behavior among children.However, while the need for such regulations is evident, it is crucial to acknowledge the repercussions that might arise. Striking a balance between protecting children and upholding adults' civil liberties presents a significant challenge. If governments were to impose stringent restrictions on content intended for mature audiences, it may infringe upon the rights of adults to choose what they want to watch or share with their families. Such overreach could lead to censorship debates, where the line between safeguarding the youth and infringing on freedom of expression becomes blurred.The responsibility ultimately lies with both the government and the media industry to foster a healthier viewing environment for children. Collaborative efforts could lead to effective programming without resorting to extreme regulations that limit creativity or infringe upon personal freedoms. Educational campaigns aimed at promoting parental guidance and media literacy can serve as complementary measures to any regulatory efforts. By creating a well-rounded approach to content regulation and parental involvement, we can ensure that children grow up with an understanding of moral values devoid of the harmful influences of violence in entertainment.
384;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world. Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act. Personally, I tend to disagree with this statement, while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence.On the one hand, I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun. An obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him. Obviously, police officers can force a criminal to surrender, because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public. As a result, some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence.On the other hand, there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities. Firstly, the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries. Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably. Secondly, cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs. Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance.In conclusion, it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence. However, some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment. In my view, the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act.;The increase in criminality around the world has become a pressing issue, warranting analysis of its underlying causes. While some individuals argue that the rise in crime is disproportionately linked to the police's reliance on firearms, I contend that this perspective oversimplifies a multifaceted problem. Various other factors contribute to the escalating levels of violence in society.Firstly, socio-economic conditions play a crucial role in the rates of criminal activity. High unemployment, poverty, and lack of education create an environment where individuals may feel compelled to engage in illegal activities as a means of survival. Communities plagued by these issues often experience higher crime rates, as the desperation for financial resources may lead individuals to resort to theft, drug trafficking, or other criminal acts. Hence, addressing these root causes could be far more effective in curbing crime than merely scrutinizing police methods.Moreover, societal issues such as systemic inequality and inadequate mental health resources can exacerbate tensions that lead to violence. Disparities in access to education, healthcare, and social services can alienate certain groups, promoting feelings of disenfranchisement. Such sentiments, when coupled with untreated mental health issues, can foster environments ripe for crime.Additionally, the influence of culture and media cannot be overlooked. The glorification of violence in films, video games, and music can desensitize individuals to the repercussions of criminal behavior. This cultural phenomenon can normalize aggressive behavior and create a perception that violence is an acceptable means of solving disputes.In conclusion, while the use of firearms by law enforcement may affect public perception of safety, it is essential to recognize the broader socio-economic and cultural factors that significantly contribute to rising criminality. A comprehensive approach that addresses these root issues is vital for effectively reducing crime rates and promoting a safer society.
385;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child's success in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"It goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted. Their success should be attributed to many different external factors. It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments. However, in my opinion, the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements.To begin with, the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children. In high school, for instance, an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same. From a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children, which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children's academic performances.To add up, when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such, classmates are second to none. It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents, explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others; it can be, for example, lessons on the class, social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents. Sharing the same age, children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas, to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments, resulting in deeper comprehension.All advantages considered, classmates are unrivalled by the children's parents as they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion, two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school.";Classmates are integral to shaping the academic experiences of students, often serving as the most crucial influence on individual achievements. The competitive atmosphere fostered within a classroom environment can significantly motivate students to excel. Within this social network, students engage in both collaborative and competitive interactions that can spur them to push their limits and strive for higher performance. The sense of rivalry can inspire determination, encouraging peers to study harder, improve their grades, and enrich their overall learning experience.From a psychological perspective, the emotional dynamics among classmates play a vital role in shaping academic outcomes. The feeling of being subordinate to peers creates a form of social pressure that can both challenge and elevate a child’s performance. When children perceive their classmates as high achievers, they may feel compelled to enhance their efforts to keep pace. This pressure can stimulate growth, encouraging them to refine their skills and strategies in a quest for academic success.However, this competitive environment is not devoid of potential drawbacks. Persistent feelings of inadequacy or the fear of failure in the face of peer comparison can lead to anxiety and stress. While some students thrive under pressure and use it as a catalyst for achievement, others may struggle, which can harm their self-esteem and academic performance over time. Thus, the influence of classmates is a double-edged sword, capable of fostering both motivation and anxiety.In conclusion, classmates undeniably serve as a significant influence on individual achievements, creating a competitive atmosphere that spurs children to excel. Understanding the psychological implications of this dynamic is crucial, as it frames how students interact with one another and the effects these interactions have on their academic journeys. Ultimately, striking a balance between healthy competition and emotional well-being is essential for facilitating optimal performance in educational settings.
386;Living in big cities is bad for people's health. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, more and more people are moving to big cities to live. However, while life in those cities is good in some ways, I completely argue that people's health would therefore be affected negatively.Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before. Exhaust from transportation, especially cars, and factories' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases. Besides, water pollution makes people's health become more critical. The fact is that dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people's bodies and create severe problems, which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time. Moreover, it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink. Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today's market. Also, overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases, especially cough, sneezing and illness. Furthermore, living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas. Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary, pickpocketing, trickery, vandalism, smuggling or even murder. Earning money for living becomes more difficult, living healthy in such places is getting harder also.In conclusion, I believe that life in big cities can have negative effects on people's health. Thus, both government and individual should take steps to diminish the consequences involved.;In recent years, there has been a significant trend of migration towards big cities, driven by the promise of better job opportunities, diverse living environments, and access to modern amenities. While urban living indeed offers various advantages, such as a vibrant social life and advanced healthcare facilities, the impact on public health is becoming increasingly concerning. One of the most pressing issues facing urban dwellers is environmental pollution, which poses a serious threat to both physical and mental well-being.Air quality in major cities is often compromised due to emissions from vehicles, industrial activities, and construction projects. High levels of pollutants, including particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide, can lead to respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and aggravated asthma, particularly among vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. Furthermore, noise pollution from traffic and public activities disrupts sleep patterns and increases stress levels, contributing to a decline in overall mental health.Water pollution is another severe issue in urban areas, where runoff from roads and improper waste disposal contaminate water supplies. Access to clean water is essential for health, and in many cities, the degradation of water quality poses a risk of waterborne diseases, which disproportionately affect low-income communities.Moreover, urban living often leads to sedentary lifestyles, as many residents rely on public transport and avoid outdoor activities due to overcrowding and safety concerns. This lack of physical activity, compounded by the stressors of city life, can lead to obesity and other lifestyle-related illnesses.In summary, while the allure of city living is undeniable, it comes with significant health challenges driven largely by environmental pollution. As urban populations continue to grow, addressing these issues through effective policies and community-driven initiatives is essential to ensure that the benefits of city life do not come at the expense of public health. Only then can we create sustainable urban environments that support the well-being of all residents.
387;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society. To some extent, I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control. First of all, it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime. However, this is not as simple as it sounds. In fact, stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally. People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control. Moreover, there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens. As a result, the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself. Therefore, if a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes. All in all, it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate. On the other hand, criminal mind seems to be more related to violence. Consequently, we should pay more attention to adjust people's behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control.;"The debate over whether policemen should carry firearms is a contentious issue that often stirs strong emotions on both sides. Critics argue that allowing police officers to bear arms may escalate violence in society, leading to tragic outcomes in already volatile situations. However, while this concern is valid, it overlooks a critical point: the majority of gun violence is perpetrated with firearms obtained illegally. Therefore, focusing solely on the existence of police firearms may miss the broader picture of crime management in a community.To understand the implications of armed policing, we must recognize that most gun-related offenses occur not with weapons licensed and regulated by the law, but rather through firearms trafficked into communities illegally. Criminals typically do not abide by laws that govern gun ownership; instead, they acquire weapons through illicit means, thus evading legal restrictions. This stark reality suggests that the issue of gun violence is more complex than merely whether the police are armed.If a government is serious about reducing crime rates and managing violence in its communities, it is crucial to focus on regulating and managing the actions of its citizens, particularly those engaged in or influenced by criminal behavior. Effective crime control involves comprehensive strategies that address the underlying factors contributing to violence, such as poverty, education, and social cohesion. Programs that foster community engagement, improve economic opportunities, and promote peaceful conflict resolution can substantially mitigate violence more so than merely restricting police armament.In conclusion, while concerns about police violence are legitimate, the emphasis should be placed on managing the sources of criminal behavior rather than restricting police access to firearms. By addressing the root causes of gun violence and supporting the police in their efforts to maintain law and order, society can work towards a safer environment for all its citizens."
388;Education is the single most important factor in the development of a country. Do you agree?;Education is undeniably an economic necessity. In most countries, it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly. In highly industrialized countries, undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all. I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country.In a developing country, not many can afford to send their children to school. There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities. They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands. These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen, can hardly eat three meals a day, let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday. As a result, these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents.Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors, lawyers or engineers. Basic education teaches one child to read and write. Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information. A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient. A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment. In the same way, a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society. Collectively, the benefits of education can make a man, a society and a developed country.In conclusion, education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country. The more people in the country become educated, the better chance it can develop.;Education is often heralded as the cornerstone of development in any society, yet in many developing countries, the harsh reality is that a significant portion of the population cannot afford to send their children to school. This socioeconomic barrier perpetuates a cycle of poverty, hampering individuals and communities from reaching their full potential. However, it’s essential to recognize that development through education does not solely equate to the cultivation of a workforce filled with doctors, lawyers, or engineers. The primary goal of education should be to empower individuals with knowledge, critical thinking skills, and the ability to make informed decisions. A well-informed individual might not hold a prestigious title or occupy a high-ranking position in society, yet their contribution is invaluable. He or she possesses the capacity to act sensibly, adapt to circumstances, and make sound judgments that can facilitate personal and communal growth. For instance, a farmer educated in sustainable agricultural practices can greatly enhance crop yields and improve the livelihoods of their family and community, regardless of their academic qualifications. Moreover, educational development fosters social awareness and civic responsibility. An educated populace is more likely to engage in community initiatives, advocate for rights, and contribute to democratic processes. This can lead to transformative changes at the grassroots level. In conclusion, the narrative surrounding education in developing countries should shift from an obsession with elite careers to a broader understanding of its impact on society. Empowering individuals with knowledge and understanding equips them not only to contribute to the economy but also to uplift their communities, create meaningful change, and make responsible decisions. Hence, education, in all its forms, is a catalyst for genuine development, offering a path toward a more equitable and sustainable future.
389;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this sets a bad example for young people. To what extent to you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth. To some extent, I do not agree with this statement.First of all, it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people. We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone, especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off. However, the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles. They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them. Therefore, it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills. Moreover, it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities' world without any talents or achievements. We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows, for example; The Voice, X Factor or Next Top Models etc. As a result, to become a star and an inspiration for people, a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates. Thus, only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore, it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters. In conclusion, people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation. That is the reason why celebrities nowadays give more good influence on young people than they were previously.";"In today's world, the influence of celebrities on adolescents is a topic of ongoing debate. Some argue that many young people are being negatively impacted by individuals who, despite lacking genuine talent, have achieved fame through their extravagant lifestyles and excessive wealth. This phenomenon raises concerns about the values that adolescents internalize, as they may idolize the superficial aspects of celebrity culture, rather than the dedication and effort typically associated with genuine success. However, this perspective underestimates the evolving consciousness of today's youth and their increasing discernment when it comes to role models.The current generation of adolescents is more conscious than ever about the importance of positive lifestyles and the implications of their influences. With the rise of social media, young people are not merely passive recipients of information; they actively engage with content, critically evaluating who they choose to follow. Life skills—such as critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and digital literacy—equip them to discern between authentic achievements and superficial fame. As they navigate a complex world filled with information, adolescents are learning to prioritize well-being, solid values, and meaningful connections over materialistic pursuits.Moreover, while the presence of untalented individuals among the ranks of the wealthy and famous may be prominent, it is important to note that true sustainability in the celebrity world is rarely achieved without some form of talent or significant achievement. Whether through acting, music, or entrepreneurship, those who rise to fame without merit are often short-lived. Audiences tend to gravitate towards those who display genuine skill, authenticity, and hard work. Thus, while some adolescents may be drawn to celebrities with lavish lifestyles, most are capable of navigating their influences wisely, focusing instead on individuals who inspire them through their talents and contributions to society. In conclusion, while the allure of wealth and luxury can be tempting, the young generation is increasingly equipped with the tools to critically assess their surroundings. Their growing emphasis on positive lifestyles and the recognition of true talent serve as a testament to their resilience against negative influences in the celebrity sphere."
390;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to whether or not mobiles phones have negative effects on our social life. Indeed, mobile phones have widely been used by people of all ages. However, I believe, this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society.In the first place, spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills. For example, as people, especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones, they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends, and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children's eyesight and physical posture. As a result, it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently.Furthermore, the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development. For instance, there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature. In these games, children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players, and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviors. Consequently, frequent conflicts may occur during communication.However, we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints. Mobile phones , such as smart phones, has made our communication easy and convenience. The reason is that, as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones, people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge. Thus, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication. To sum up, although mobile phones make our communication faster, it also gives rise to many social problems such as children's social skills and their mental health. Therefore, i highly advocate that we should use mobile phone in moderation in order to avoid these serious problems.;Mobile phones have undeniably become an integral part of modern life, embraced by people of all ages across the globe. These handheld devices facilitate instant communication, access to information, and entertainment at our fingertips. However, despite their myriad benefits, I believe that this great invention of the 21st century has introduced significant problems within our society, particularly regarding our social skills.One of the most pressing concerns is the detrimental effect of excessive mobile phone usage on interpersonal communication. As individuals become increasingly absorbed in their screens, face-to-face interactions are often neglected. Social gatherings, once vibrant with conversation and connection, now frequently feature a sea of individuals distracted by their devices. This technological preoccupation can lead to superficial relationships, as meaningful dialogues are replaced by brief text messages or comments on social media platforms. The art of conversation is diminished, with many people now struggling to engage in or sustain discussions without falling back on their phones.Moreover, the reliance on mobile phones diminishes our ability to read non-verbal cues, which are crucial for effective communication. Facial expressions, tone of voice, and body language are integral parts of conveying emotions, yet these nuances can be lost in text-based interactions. This loss can lead to misunderstandings and an overall decline in empathy, as individuals become accustomed to communicating through screens rather than personal interactions.In conclusion, while mobile phones are remarkable tools that enhance connectivity, their overuse can significantly harm our social skills. The decline in meaningful conversations, coupled with the inability to engage with others on a personal level, presents a pressing issue in today's society. It is essential that we find a balance, allowing ourselves to enjoy the conveniences of technology without sacrificing the richness of human interaction.
391;The environment problems facing today's world are so great that there is little ordinary people can do to improve the situation. Government and large companies should be responsible for reducing the amount of damage being done to the environment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Nowadays, many countries are concerned with the environment problems. There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that. Personally, I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment, but we need to analyze some specific situations.On one hand, solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies, and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems. For example, air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries, and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution, while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances. However, individuals are unable to cope with these things.Besides, the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people. It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection. This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society, and the government controls many influential media, such as TV stations and newspapers, which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens.On the other hand, it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection, and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment. For instance, many people driving private cars could cause air pollution, and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment. If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities, this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement.In conclusion, the government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues, but every citizen also can contribute to the environment.;The debate surrounding environmental protection often hinges on the responsibility of various stakeholders in society. A common viewpoint posits that governments and large firms are primarily responsible for safeguarding our planet, leaving ordinary citizens as passive spectators. Advocates for this perspective argue that addressing significant environmental issues, such as climate change and pollution, necessitates substantial financial resources and advanced technologies—capabilities that are predominantly within the reach of governmental bodies and large corporations.Indeed, governmental policies can enact sweeping changes, such as implementing renewable energy initiatives, regulating industrial emissions, and investing in sustainable infrastructure. Big firms also have the financial capacity to adopt green technologies and practices that can drastically reduce their ecological footprint. However, this argument can inadvertently diminish the role that individual citizens play in environmental advocacy and action.On the other hand, ordinary people can play an essential role in environmental protection through collective action and community engagement. Simple yet impactful actions—such as recycling, reducing waste, conserving water, and promoting awareness—can lead to considerable positive changes. Grassroots movements have shown that citizens can unite to advocate for policy changes, influence corporate practices, and foster sustainable lifestyles. Moreover, when individuals actively participate in protecting the environment, they also reap benefits, such as improved air and water quality, which directly enhance their quality of life.In conclusion, while governments and large firms undoubtedly carry significant responsibilities in tackling environmental challenges, the role of ordinary citizens should not be underestimated. Encouraging individual participation in environmental protection can lead to crucial societal shifts and foster a culture of sustainability. By working together, all sectors of society can contribute to a more sustainable future, emphasizing that environmental stewardship is a shared responsibility.
392;Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society, so this kind of information should be restricted on media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Nowadays, the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes. Personally, I believe such details should be strictly censored, if not banned altogether.It is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating. These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is, more often than that, to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings. Consequently, a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated or fraudulent, which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes.An even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise. This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans, avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police. Thus, without the prevention on criminal details, the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken.Most importantly, particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced. Without their consent, this could only add to theses innocent people's mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions.In conclusion, I strongly hold my point that any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer, as they may be false, may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes.;The manner in which crime is covered in the media has profound implications for societal perception, safety, and harmony. A significant amount of crime coverage is not only biased and exaggerated, but occasionally even fraudulent. This selective reporting distorts reality, leading to communities that are gripped by fear and apprehension. While it's essential to keep the public informed about safety issues, sensationalized crime reports often leave law-abiding citizens feeling increasingly vulnerable and unsafe in their neighborhoods.Additionally, detailed depictions of criminal activities can inadvertently serve as instructional materials for potential criminals. When news outlets provide vivid accounts of a heist or a sophisticated scam, they expose methods and tactics that could empower aspiring lawbreakers. This unintended consequence complicates the fight against crime and undermines lawful behavior in society. It is troubling to think that the very information meant to protect communities could also educate those seeking to exploit vulnerabilities.Moreover, the prevalence of sensationalized crime reporting contributes to a dangerous cycle where fear erodes social cohesion. Healthy societies thrive on trust and mutual respect among their members. However, when communities are inundated with tragic narratives of violence or lawlessness, the reactions of residents often skew towards isolation and suspicion. This dismantles social bonds and leads to a culture of anxiety.To break this cycle of fear and mistrust, a shift in how crime is reported is imperative. Journalists and media outlets must take responsibility for providing nuanced, accurate accounts of criminal activity without exaggeration. On the one hand, they should highlight successful community efforts in crime prevention and restoration of social order. By prioritizing balanced reporting, societies can foster unity, reduce irrational fear, and encourage constructive dialogue surrounding safety, ultimately promoting harmony over terror.
393;Some people say that in our modern age, it is unnecessary to teach children about the skills of handwriting. To what extent do you agree or disagree;In this age of modern technology, some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children. To some people, it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task. From my point of view, children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting for several reasons.Despite the convenience from up-to-date facilities, handwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning. Firstly, this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes, doing homework and writing. It enables to improve learners' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well. Under the guidance of parents or teachers, children can benefit from practicing handwriting. This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content, elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities.Secondly, parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance. The fact is that kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons. It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works. Moreover, the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills. For example, with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word, learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes. To conclude, no matter how fast and convenient modern devices bring to us in writing, handwriting is still a needed skill for all of people, especially students at the early age.;"In the age of modern technology, where keyboards and touchscreens dominate communication, the importance of teaching handwriting to children is often underestimated. While it is undeniable that advanced facilities and devices have transformed how students access information and express themselves, handwriting remains a critical skill that profoundly impacts their learning experience. Handwriting is more than just the ability to form letters; it enhances cognitive development. When children engage in writing by hand, they are actively developing fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and memory retention. Studies have shown that students who write notes by hand tend to understand and remember material better than those who type. This occurs because handwriting requires more cognitive effort, allowing for deeper processing of information. In contrast, the ease of typing can lead to superficial learning, where students may not fully grasp the material.Moreover, poor handwriting can directly affect a student's academic performance. Teachers often emphasize legibility as it influences their perception of a student's abilities. Illegible or messy handwriting can obscure the intended message, causing frustration for both the reader and the writer. It can lead to misunderstandings in communication and negatively impact grades, particularly in subjects where written expression is critical, such as language arts and history. Additionally, in high-stakes testing environments, the clarity of handwriting can be crucial. If examiners struggle to read a student's answers, it may result in lost points. In conclusion, despite the convenience that modern technology offers, handwriting instruction remains essential in nurturing well-rounded learners. By emphasizing the importance of writing by hand, educators can equip students with the tools they need to succeed, ensuring that they do not overlook this fundamental skill amid the fast-paced digital world. Handwriting should be embraced not merely as a relic of the past but as a valuable asset for the present and future."
394;Families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable. However, I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential.Firstly, by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor. It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course. With the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life.Secondly, the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital. Obviously, this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation; therefore, the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue. In addition, the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care.Many parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them. They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use. Nevertheless, we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade. We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes.On the whole, I do believe that taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in.";The debate surrounding private vs. public education often evokes strong opinions, particularly when it comes to the issue of taxation. Proponents of private schooling frequently argue that the taxes they pay towards state education are unreasonable, particularly when they are already funding their children’s private education. This sentiment highlights a significant concern among affluent families who feel financially burdened by a dual obligation to support both private educational institutions and public funding.Advocates for private schooling may believe that their financial contributions help to level the educational playing field, effectively narrowing the gap between rich and poor. By investing in private education, these families often provide access to resources, advanced curricula, and opportunities that may otherwise be unavailable to underprivileged children in underfunded public schools. However, it is critical to recognize that this rationale may overlook the larger systemic issues that contribute to educational inequality.Nevertheless, the idea of implementing tax reductions for parents whose children attend private schools raises valid concerns about the wastage of public capital. Reducing taxes for these families would divert funds from public education, exacerbating existing disparities. Public schools rely on stable and sufficient funding to maintain quality education for all students, including those who cannot afford private schooling. Thus, a tax reduction could lead to diminished resources, further straining an already overburdened public education system and jeopardizing the quality of education for many.Ultimately, while the grievances of those sending their children to private institutions are understandable, the implications of tax reductions could inflict significant harm on public education. Education funding should be directed towards ensuring equitable access for all children, rather than favoring those who can afford private schooling. Balancing the interests of affluent families with the needs of the broader educational community remains a complex and essential challenge in the realm of educational policy.
395;Government investment in the arts, such as music and theatre, is a waste of money. Governments must invest this money in public services instead. To what extent do you agree with this statement?;There has been wide opinion that Government should invest more money on public services rather than arts such as music and theatre. However, in my perspective, both public services and arts worth investment.It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing. Investing in hospitals helps improve people's health, also, in schools assists with raising our children's education level. Apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately, our standard of living would deteriorate.But our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts. Arts include many forms and music as well as cinema are the most typical. These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy. The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment, for instance K-pop and Hollywood, and these industries can not survive without goverment's financial assistance. The long and the short of it, both arts and public services are important to the community and should be invested properly.;The ongoing debate regarding government funding often pits public services against the arts, with many advocating for greater investment in essential services like healthcare and education. While it is undeniable that public services such as hospitals and schools are critical to the well-being of society, I believe that investing in the arts, including music and theatre, is equally valuable. Both sectors contribute significantly to the fabric of our communities and the overall quality of life.Public services are indispensable for a functioning society. They ensure that citizens have access to healthcare, education, and safety. Every penny spent on these services directly translates into improved quality of life for individuals and greater social equity. Hospitals save lives, schools educate future generations, and infrastructure supports economic growth. In times of crisis, the importance of public services is magnified, underscoring the need for robust funding.However, we must not overlook the crucial role that the arts play in society. The arts foster cultural identity, encourage creativity, and provide a platform for expression. Music, theatre, and other art forms enrich our lives, bringing joy and inspiration to communities. They can also drive economic growth through tourism and job creation, as cultural events attract visitors and promote local businesses. Moreover, exposure to the arts has been shown to enhance cognitive development and emotional intelligence, particularly in children.In conclusion, both public services and the arts merit investment from the government. While public services are essential for basic survival and prosperity, the arts provide cultural enrichment and emotional well-being. A balanced approach that recognizes the importance of both sectors will lead to a more vibrant, dynamic, and resilient society. By investing in both public services and the arts, the government can strengthen the community as a whole, ensuring a better future for everyone.
396;It is inevitable that as technology advances, traditional cultures will be lost. It seems that we cannot have these two things together. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, technology has been developing significantly, impacting many aspects of our life. While there is belief that technology advances means a lost in traditional cultures, I would argue that although the affect of technology on culture is undeniable, it has also contributed to the preservation of traditonal culture.Thanks to modern technology, our life has been improved with many gadgets. The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working, it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries. However, these newfangled practices has replaced many old traditional ones. For instance, factories equipped with new and highly-productive system has replaced old handmade products, the exchange of letters among friends is so hard to be seen as we have had emails and social network instead, new video games has superseded the old-physical ones. Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology.However, despite the drawback mentioned above, technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways. Internet has aided to assess the young generations to the cultural identity of many nations from all around the world. With the help of advanced methods, many art masterpiece has been well restorated and well preserved. Modern devices also assist the scientists to study the ancient societies much more deeply, hence discovering more cultural traces.To give a brief conclusion, Modern technogy has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways.;In the rapidly evolving landscape of the 21st century, modern technology has significantly transformed numerous aspects of our lives, including the way we engage with traditional cultures. While it is undeniable that many old cultural practices and customs have faded or been altered under the influence of technology, this same technological advancement has also provided remarkable avenues for the preservation and study of these cultural heritages.One of the most prominent drawbacks of modern technology is its tendency to overshadow traditional practices. The advent of social media, virtual reality, and streaming services has led to a homogenization of cultures, where the unique elements of local traditions are often replaced with global trends. For example, traditional storytelling may be supplanted by short video clips, diminishing the richness of oral histories that have been passed down through generations. As a result, many unique cultural identities risk being lost in the tide of technological change.Despite these challenges, technology has also played a crucial role in maintaining and revitalizing traditional cultures. Digital archiving allows for the documentation of languages that are at risk of extinction, providing invaluable resources for future generations. Online platforms have enabled cultural organizations to reach wider audiences, creating community awareness and interest in traditional practices. Moreover, virtual workshops and interactive online experiences make it possible for individuals to engage with their heritage in new and exciting ways, fostering a sense of belonging that transcends geographical boundaries.Furthermore, technology has facilitated scholarly research, allowing anthropologists and historians to share their findings more rapidly and efficiently. The ability to communicate across the globe helps unite different cultures, promoting collaborative efforts that can breathe new life into dwindling practices.In conclusion, while modern technology has indeed posed threats to traditional cultures by overshadowing them, it simultaneously offers innovative tools for their preservation and study. The challenge lies in finding a balance that honors tradition while embracing progress, ensuring that the richness of our cultural heritage continues to thrive in an increasingly digital world.
397;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students to study in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty. Personally, I do not agree the viewpoint, because many different characters exist between male and female students.On one hand, boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality. Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases. For instance, there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world. Many boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts. Besides, girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter. This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect.Furthermore, it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender, and that does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development. For example, a girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department, but she is unlikely to focus on her subject, and this also can block the girl's future development and career prospect.On the other hand, universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities, and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects. It would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender.In conclusion, it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject.;"The debate surrounding gender enrollment in universities and colleges is multifaceted and increasingly relevant in today’s academic landscape. Many advocate for an equal enrollment of male and female students across all faculties, arguing that such balance promotes equality and inclusivity. However, discrepancies in interests among genders often result in a natural divergence in subject choice; boys typically gravitate toward science and technology, while girls often prefer literature, education, and the arts.A critical argument for equal enrollment is rooted in the belief that diversity enriches the educational experience. When students from different genders study together in various disciplines, they bring unique perspectives, fostering innovation and collaboration. Therefore, achieving equal representation can lead to a more holistic education that prepares all students to work in diverse environments.However, it is essential to delve deeper into the observed preferences of genders regarding subject choice. While many boys show an interest in fields like engineering and computer science, girls frequently find their passions in the humanities and arts. This trend could be attributed to societal norms, educational encouragement, or personal interests. It is imperative for universities to recognize these preferences not as rigid stereotypes but as areas where they can actively work to promote change.For instance, efforts should be made to encourage more girls to pursue science and technology through scholarship programs, mentorship, and outreach initiatives that showcase female role models in STEM. Similarly, universities can develop campaigns to attract boys to the humanities, emphasizing the value of empathy, communication, and creativity in these fields.In conclusion, while universities must strive for equal enrollment, they should also actively encourage students to explore a wider range of subjects. Promoting interdisciplinary study, removing gender biases, and fostering an inclusive environment can help break down barriers and allow individuals to pursue their genuine interests, ultimately enriching the academic landscape."
398;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Celebrities, for example movie stars, are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend, etc. It is human nature that people, especially youngsters, are attracted to the celebrities they favour, and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible. But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children.The first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard. This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living. Further more, they will not value other people's hard work and take everything for granted.Meanwhile, not all celebrities are role models. It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols, having messy sex lives. Worse still, without proper parenting, children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living.Of course, some celebrities, e.g. writers, passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children for they share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world.In conclusion, media should shift its focus from covering celebrities to elsewhere. Meanwhile, children's access to the celebrities news on the media should be restricted and they should study only from the celebrities who can act positively.;In today's media-saturated society, celebrities, particularly movie stars, are often showcased in glamorous lifestyles filled with luxury, high-profile romances, and a seemingly idyllic existence. While this portrayal captivates audiences and inspires admiration, I contend that it poses a troubling trend, especially in its impact on children. The image of effortless wealth and success can distort young minds, leading them to form misguided perceptions about the realities of work and achievement.Children are impressionable, and when they see celebrities living opulent lives without apparent effort, they may come to believe that success does not require hard work or commitment. This notion undermines the value of education and diligence, contributing to a culture that prioritizes fame over knowledge and skill development. Instead of being encouraged to strive for academic excellence and cultivate their talents, children may feel that they can achieve a similar lifestyle through luck or personality rather than through perseverance.Moreover, not all celebrities serve as appropriate role models. Many figures in the entertainment industry are embroiled in controversies or engage in behaviors that are far from exemplary. As children idolize these individuals, they risk internalizing negative values, such as materialism and superficiality. The tendency to glorify celebrity culture distorts the understanding of success and contributes to the erosion of moral and ethical standards among impressionable youth.In conclusion, while celebrities undoubtedly influence popular culture, the narrative surrounding their lives can have detrimental effects on children. It is crucial that we guide young people towards recognizing the importance of hard work, education, and responsible behavior rather than merely emulating the often unrealistic lives portrayed in the media. Encouraging a balanced view of success can help cultivate a generation that values effort and integrity over fleeting glamour.
399;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;"In today’s rapidly evolving socio-economic landscape, the concept of the welfare state has taken on new dimensions, particularly concerning healthcare. Governments are increasingly recognized as custodians of public welfare, which includes providing sustainable healthcare services and promoting health education among their citizens. The well-being of a population is intricately tied to access to quality healthcare and information that empowers individuals to make informed health choices. As such, a multifaceted approach incorporating both treatment and preventive measures is critical.Sustainable healthcare encapsulates not only the provision of medical services but also the creation of an environment that fosters health and well-being. This involves investing in infrastructure, such as hospitals and clinics, ensuring that they are adequately staffed and equipped to address the diverse healthcare needs of the community. Additionally, health education plays an indispensable role in creating a well-informed populace. Education initiatives focused on nutrition, exercise, mental health, and the prevention of chronic diseases empower individuals to take charge of their health. Preventive measures often reduce the long-term burden on healthcare systems and improve overall public health outcomes.Despite the necessity for treatment options to address immediate health concerns, a greater proportion of the budget should be allocated to education and preventive issues. The long-term benefits of prevention are significant; for every dollar invested in preventive healthcare, there can be substantial savings on expensive treatments in the future. By reorienting budgetary priorities towards education and prevention, governments can not only enhance the quality of life for their citizens but also foster a more resilient healthcare system that effectively meets the challenges of modern society.In conclusion, for a welfare state to thrive, it is imperative that emphasis is placed on sustainable healthcare coupled with robust health education programs. A strategic shift in budget allocation towards prevention and education over treatment will pave the way for healthier communities and a more financially sustainable public health framework."
400;Fatherhood ought to be emphasized as much as motherhood. The idea that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies leads on to the idea that they are also responsible for bringing the children up. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families, the smallest component of the society. While mother's role is essential in a child's life, I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood.The first reason why the father's role should be equal to the mother's role is the nature of parantage. In my view, the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child's characteristics. For example, in a traditional Turkish family, while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child, a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child. The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today. In my opinion, we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life, including relationships. For instance, a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today's society. Instead, all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals. Therefore, I believe that having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity.In conclusion, fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships.;"In today's rapidly changing world, raising and nurturing children presents significant challenges for families. As society grapples with various economic, social, and emotional pressures, the responsibilities of parenthood have become increasingly complex. Among these responsibilities, the roles of both mothers and fathers are essential in shaping a child's development and well-being. While it is widely acknowledged that a mother's influence is critical, I firmly believe that fatherhood is equally vital to fostering a healthy and balanced parenting dynamic.The role of a father extends far beyond mere financial provision; it involves active participation in a child's emotional, social, and cognitive development. Research has consistently shown that children benefit immensely from the engagement of both parents. Fathers serve as role models, demonstrating valuable life skills, conflict-resolution techniques, and emotional stability. Their presence in a child's life contributes to building resilience, fostering self-esteem, and enhancing social competence. In families with actively involved fathers, children tend to exhibit higher levels of academic performance and improved mental health outcomes.Moreover, the importance of role models in a child’s life cannot be understated. Children often emulate their parents' behaviors and values, making it imperative for both mothers and fathers to exemplify qualities such as empathy, responsibility, and integrity. The partnership between mothers and fathers creates a comprehensive framework within which children can learn about gender roles, shared responsibilities, and healthy relationships. This balanced upbringing not only aids in their immediate development but also prepares them to navigate the complexities of adult life.In conclusion, while mothers play a crucial role in nurturing children, fathers are equally indispensable to healthy parenting. By embracing their responsibilities, fathers contribute meaningfully to their children’s growth and development. The collaborative efforts of both parents lay the foundation for a well-rounded upbringing, ultimately leading to a healthier future generation."
401;It is important that children should study hard at school. time spent playing sport is time wasted. to what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people believe that studying hard is essential part for children, otherwise others people think that playing sport is waste of time. In my point of view, both of studying hard and playing sports are part of life to children. On the other hand, studying hard will give children a better future. Studying hard gives children with a plenty of knowledge and skills for their future. Naturally, children will be growing up and looking for their job. For instance, children who always studying hard and getting high achievement, it will be easy to pass qualification for work and they are more likely to find great work at multinational company. If they working at multinational company as the result is they can earn higher salary. The message is when you always studying harder than others you will get best results.At the same time, playing sports will give good effects on children. There are many popular sports among children such as football, basketball, and volleyball. Also, there are many benefit when children doing sport. Firstly, children who always playing sport like football, they will be active as a person and learn to become team-player. It will be good for children, because indirectly they will learn how to socialize each other as a team. That will make children getting lots of friends, so they can contribute positively to community. Secondly, playing sport makes children getting healthy and become children's well-being. In conclusion, both studying hard at school and playing sports can improve children's future.;In the journey of childhood, two pivotal activities emerge as essential components for holistic development: studying hard and participating in sports. Both endeavors play significant roles in shaping young minds and bodies, preparing them for the myriad challenges of adulthood.Studying hard is foundational for fostering knowledge and skills necessary for future success. Through education, children acquire critical thinking abilities, creativity, and problem-solving skills that are vital in an increasingly complex world. The academic environment stimulates intellectual growth, encouraging children to explore diverse subjects and develop a passion for learning. As students engage with various disciplines—ranging from mathematics to literature—they build a robust knowledge base that not only supports their studies but also enhances their understanding of the world around them. This analytical framework is invaluable, as it paves the way for informed decision-making, effective communication, and adaptability in professional settings later in life.Conversely, playing sports contributes significantly to children's physical health and overall well-being. Engaging in athletic activities promotes fitness, instilling healthy habits that can last a lifetime. Regular physical activity aids in the development of coordination, strength, and endurance, while also reducing the risk of obesity and associated health issues. Beyond physical benefits, sports foster emotional and social skills, teaching children the importance of teamwork, resilience, and discipline. Participation in sports also provides an outlet for stress, allowing children to channel their energy positively while forming lasting friendships and connections.In conclusion, both studying hard and engaging in sports are indispensable aspects of childhood. They complement one another, with academic pursuits laying the groundwork for professional and personal growth, and athletic endeavors promoting health and well-being. Striking a balance between the two is crucial, equipping children not only with knowledge but also with the vitality and social skills that are essential for a fulfilling life.
