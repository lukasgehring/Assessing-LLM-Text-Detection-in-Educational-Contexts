0;Some people think that children should be taught to compete, but others think that children should be taught to co-operate that become more useful adults. What do you think?;It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.;The discussion about whether children should be instructed in the art of competition or cooperation has ignited lively debate among educators and parents alike. While some contend that instilling a sense of competition is crucial for children's future achievements, I strongly advocate for the notion that teaching cooperation is far more advantageous in cultivating responsible and capable adults.Instructing children in cooperation nurtures vital social skills such as communication, empathy, and problem-solving. When children collaborate towards a shared objective, they begin to recognize and value each other's strengths and weaknesses, which fosters a more cohesive and effective team dynamic. This experience equips them for the real world, where collaboration and teamwork are highly prized. Additionally, cooperation promotes a sense of community and mutual respect, foundational elements for forging strong, enduring relationships.Conversely, emphasizing competition can foster a self-centered mentality, where individual success takes precedence over collaboration. This mindset can breed an unhealthy fixation on winning, resulting in stress, anxiety, and diminished self-esteem when faced with challenges. An excessive focus on competition may also create a cutthroat atmosphere, pressuring children to achieve at any price and detracting from the principles of fair play and sportsmanship.Ultimately, although competition can offer certain advantages, I maintain that teaching children the value of cooperation yields more significant benefits over time. By learning to collaborate, exchange ideas, and support each other, children will grow into well-rounded, empathetic, and productive adults. As they navigate the complexities of life, they will be better prepared to form strong relationships, operate effectively in teams, and make positive contributions to their communities. In essence, fostering cooperation in children is essential to raising a generation of compassionate, collaborative, and successful individuals.
1;Nowadays, more people are migrating to other countries than ever before. In order to become integrated into society in their adopted countries, immigrants should abandon their old ways and adapt to local customs and codes of behaviour. Do you agree or disagree?;The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.Firstly, maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.Secondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.To conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one’s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society.;The idea that immigrants need to relinquish their traditional practices and conform to local customs in order to integrate into society has ignited a vigorous discussion. While some people argue that assimilation is crucial for a smooth transition, others believe that maintaining one’s cultural identity is just as vital. Personally, I disagree with the notion that immigrants should entirely forsake their heritage.On one side, adapting to local customs can ease social integration and enhance economic opportunities. By embracing the values and norms of their new country, immigrants can forge stronger connections with locals, access better job prospects, and engage more effectively within their communities. However, this adjustment should not require sacrificing one’s cultural background. Immigrants bring invaluable perspectives, traditions, and practices that can enhance the cultural richness of the host nation.Conversely, losing one’s cultural identity can result in a diminished sense of self and a disconnect from one’s heritage. Safeguarding cultural practices offers immigrants a feeling of belonging and continuity, which is vital for their mental and emotional health. Furthermore, a multicultural society that celebrates diversity is likely to be more inclusive and welcoming to newcomers, allowing them to contribute their unique skills, experiences, and viewpoints.In summary, while it is important for immigrants to adapt to local customs, preserving their cultural identity is equally crucial. A balanced strategy that enables immigrants to integrate into society while honoring their cultural heritage is the most favorable outcome. By embracing diversity and fostering inclusivity, host countries can cultivate a welcoming climate that promotes social cohesion and economic success for everyone.
2;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages and different cultures around the world. While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations. Firstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country’s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists. Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores. These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard. Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country.Secondly, through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected. For instance, in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely ‘Trong Dong’ drum performance and ‘Ha Long’ bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry. Without this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works. Thus, tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes. To conclude, as far as I am concerned, international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries. In addition, the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments.;The growth of international tourism has become a prominent trend in recent years. While some individuals see this development as advantageous, others have reservations about its potential repercussions. Personally, I believe that international tourism brings both positive and negative consequences to the world.On one side, international tourism has several advantageous effects. It can enhance cultural exchange and understanding among nations, fostering global unity and collaboration. Additionally, an influx of tourists can greatly benefit local economies, as visitors spend money on lodging, dining, and souvenirs. This economic boost can lead to job creation, infrastructure improvements, and a higher quality of life for local residents. For example, countries such as Thailand, Spain, and Italy have experienced notable economic growth driven by tourism.Conversely, unchecked tourism can result in various adverse outcomes. Overcrowding can cause environmental harm, as the presence of numerous visitors can deplete local resources, pollute air and water, and damage natural ecosystems. Furthermore, the commercialization of tourist sites may lead to the dilution of local cultures and traditions. A case in point is Venice, which has encountered significant challenges due to the overwhelming number of tourists, placing stress on its infrastructure and altering the city’s essence.In summary, while international tourism can yield both advantages and drawbacks, I believe it is crucial to find a balance between encouraging tourism and protecting local cultures and environments. It is essential for governments, tourism agencies, and local communities to collaborate on sustainable tourism strategies, ensuring that the benefits are shared equitably while minimizing negative impacts. By doing this, we can promote a more responsible and advantageous form of international tourism.
3;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide. While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations.Firstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations. Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits. This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism. Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.Secondly, there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals. As the Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat’s anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions. For this reason, many marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species. Thus, it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments.To conclude, I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments. If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future.;The growth of international tourism has sparked a heated debate, with some viewing it as a beneficial trend while others express concern over its adverse effects. I believe that international tourism serves as a double-edged sword, presenting both advantages and disadvantages.On one side, international tourism offers a wide range of benefits. It facilitates cultural exchange, enabling individuals from diverse countries to understand and appreciate each other's traditions, customs, and lifestyles. This exchange fosters global unity and collaboration, helping to dismantle stereotypes and biases. Additionally, tourism plays a critical role in boosting local economies, generating substantial revenue, creating jobs, and driving economic growth. Many nations depend significantly on tourism as a primary source of income, which has enhanced the living standards of millions around the globe.Conversely, international tourism also presents several challenges. The surge in visitors can lead to overcrowding, pollution, and the degradation of popular sites, placing stress on local infrastructure and resources. Moreover, the commercialization associated with tourism can undermine traditional cultures as local practices are modified to meet tourist expectations. Additionally, the carbon emissions from international travel contribute to environmental issues such as climate change and air pollution.In summary, although international tourism has its setbacks, I contend that its advantages outweigh the disadvantages. By adopting responsible and sustainable tourism practices, we can alleviate negative impacts while amplifying positive outcomes. Encouraging cultural sensitivity, awareness, and respect can help tourists contribute to the conservation of local cultures and ecosystems rather than endangering them. Ultimately, international tourism has the potential to enrich our lives, expand our horizons, and promote global understanding, rendering it a trend worthy of encouragement and support.
4;The idea of going overseas for university study is an exciting prospect for many people. But while it may offer some advantages, it is probably better to stay home because of the difficulties a student inevitably encounters living and studying in a different culture. To what extent do you agree or disagree this statement? Give reasons for your answer.;It is every student's desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment. While some students study and live overseas to achieve this, some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas. In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.First, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures. Compared to the peers studying in the home country, it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself/herself into new environments and situations in life.Second, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet. One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness, living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life. Moreover, the one will learn living without depending on anyone else.Also, employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills. Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market. Therefore, one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his/her peers.In conclusion, there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas. However, living and studying overseas gives the individual a new perspective on the subject that is studied or in general life.;The prospect of pursuing higher education abroad has gained significant appeal for students around the globe. However, the assertion that staying in one's home country is a preferable choice acknowledges the challenges associated with living and studying in a foreign culture. I hold a partially opposing view on this matter.On one hand, it is clear that studying abroad presents considerable challenges, including cultural shock, language difficulties, and feelings of homesickness. The process of adjusting to a new environment, forging new friendships, and navigating unfamiliar academic landscapes can be quite daunting. In addition, the financial implications of studying overseas can be heavy, and many students may find it hard to sustain themselves.Conversely, I contend that the advantages of studying abroad significantly surpass the downsides. For starters, it offers students a rare chance to fully engage with a new culture, expand their worldview, and cultivate essential life skills such as independence, resilience, and adaptability. Moreover, having an international education can boost one’s career opportunities, showcasing a readiness to embrace challenges and take risks. Many foreign universities also provide exceptional education, innovative research chances, and esteemed faculty that may not be available in a student's home country.Additionally, with thoughtful planning, research, and preparation, many of the obstacles related to studying abroad can be overcome. Numerous institutions offer a range of support services, including language assistance, cultural orientation, and counseling, to aid international students as they adapt to their new surroundings. In conclusion, although studying overseas does come with challenges, I firmly believe that the advantages of this experience make it a profoundly enriching opportunity for personal and academic development. With adequate preparation and a readiness to adjust, students can flourish in a foreign culture and enjoy the benefits of an international education.
5;Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Studying abroad is one very common thing that students do, and they have different reasons for that. I believe that studying abroad has many advantages. Students gain a lot out of the experience personally, academically, and culturally.First of all, students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country. Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one's character. For example, students might face many challenges in the host country. Therefore, they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter. Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence. One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies. For example, they will get exposed to a different educational system. They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country.Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience. While living in a foreign country, students can learn a lot about the culture of that country. Furthermore, they can meet different people of the country. They can learn about their way of thinking, their customs and traditions, and way of life. Learning about others' cultures is so important. It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world. It makes us more open, and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts. Also it educates us about the world we are living in. In conclusion, studying abroad does not only have advantages, but also can change us in a very positive way. It can influence us in different aspects of life.;In recent years, studying abroad has emerged as a popular choice among students. Many opt to pursue their education in foreign institutions for a variety of reasons. A key motivating factor is the opportunity to access high-quality education and academic programs that might not be available in their home countries. For example, some nations are home to top-ranked universities that offer specialized courses in areas like engineering, business, or medicine that are lacking in the student's home country.Another compelling reason for studying abroad is the chance to expand one's cultural and social perspectives. Living and studying in a different country exposes students to new languages, traditions, and lifestyles, fostering the development of vital skills such as independence, adaptability, and effective communication—qualities that are increasingly important in today's global society. Additionally, studying abroad allows students to engage with a diverse range of individuals, creating lasting connections and networks.Moreover, studying abroad can significantly enhance career opportunities. Employers often regard international students as appealing candidates due to their unique skills and experiences that distinguish them from their peers. These students are frequently perceived as more adaptable, resilient, and open-minded—traits that are highly valued in modern workplaces. Additionally, some countries may offer superior job prospects and higher salaries, making international study a strategic move for those looking to advance their careers.In summary, students pursue education abroad for various reasons, including access to quality education, cultural enrichment, and improved career prospects. By studying internationally, students can gain a competitive edge, acquire essential skills, and forge meaningful relationships that will benefit them for years to come. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the advantages of studying abroad are likely to grow, making it an appealing option for students worldwide.
6;With the rise in popularity of the internet, newspapers will soon become a thing of the past. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The internet has been more and more popular for recent years, providing people with a huge source of information. As a result of this, print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers. Some people, however, still believe that they can exist for long time; others disagree, arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence. Personally, I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons.First of all, to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers. Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime. As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages. Hence, the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information.Another point is that, from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one. It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries. The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same, even usually less information than those he can have with the internet? The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so. For this reason, the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time.Last, but not least, when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down. This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today. At this point, newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive.In conclusion, it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media. However, this, if occurring, should be seen as a result of the ever-increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole.";The emergence of the internet has transformed the way we access information, resulting in a considerable change in how news is shared. With the growing popularity of online news outlets, many suggest that newspapers may soon become obsolete. While I recognize the influence of the internet on the newspaper sector, I only partially concur with this view.On one hand, the internet allows individuals to receive news instantaneously from any location worldwide. Online news platforms provide constant updates, keeping readers informed about the latest current events. Moreover, the internet presents a multitude of news sources, enabling readers to encounter a variety of perspectives and opinions. Consequently, this shift has led to a decrease in newspaper sales as many people gravitate towards digital options.On the other hand, I maintain that newspapers are unlikely to vanish entirely. A significant number of readers still appreciate the tactile experience of a physical newspaper and the in-depth reporting and commentary typically offered in print. Additionally, newspapers often focus heavily on local issues, delivering news and information that is pertinent to their communities—something online platforms occasionally find challenging to replicate.In summary, while the rise of the internet has certainly affected the newspaper industry, I don't believe newspapers will soon fade away. Instead, I foresee them evolving to integrate online features, such as digital editions and social media interaction. Ultimately, the future of newspapers will likely be a blend of traditional and digital formats, enabling readers to access news in the manner that best suits their preferences.
7;For successful development of a country, should a government focus its budget more on very young children education rather than universities?;"""Education is the investment in our future"", as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out, education, which fosters a civilized society, plays a significant role in a country's long-lasting prosperity. It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development. As for the two integral components within the system, elementary and advanced education, there's no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both.Concerning that elementary education, like the base of a architecture, is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today's society, government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it. So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy, and this interplay seriously compromises a country's future development. In other words, if countries, especially the developing countries, are determined to take off, one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education.That's not enough, for higher education, which represent the cutting edge of a country's academic achievements, act as the vanguard in economic and social advance. The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community. Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention, but this argument is invalid. Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money, what's more, government's big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide.From reasons listed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that, a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities, both are crucial on the way to a brighter future.";The allocation of a government’s budget plays a vital role in a nation’s progress. One significant challenge arises in the realm of education: should the government emphasize funding for early childhood education or universities? I believe prioritizing the education of very young children is crucial for a country’s successful development.Early childhood education serves as the foundation for a child's future success in academics and holistic development. Investing in the education of young children can exert a profound influence on their cognitive, social, and emotional well-being. Studies indicate that high-quality early childhood programs lead to enhanced academic achievements, improved social skills, and greater earning potential in adulthood. Additionally, a strong early education can help bridge the achievement gap and lead to better educational results overall.On the other hand, while universities play a crucial role in developing skilled and knowledgeable individuals, they benefit from the educational groundwork laid during earlier years. Solely focusing on higher education may fail to address the fundamental causes of educational inequities and may not yield as significant an impact on national development. Moreover, an educated populace that begins learning at a young age fosters a more informed and engaged citizenry, which is essential for a nation’s socio-economic and political growth.Thus, I firmly contend that governments should allocate a greater portion of their budgets to the education of young children rather than concentrating solely on universities. This approach will help equip future generations with the essential skills, knowledge, and values required for driving national development and prosperity. Such an investment promises long-term benefits, cultivating a more educated, skilled, and competitive workforce vital for a nation's success.
8;Many students have to live with roommates while going to school or university. What are some of the important qualities of a good roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to explain why these qualities are important.;"Much has been said about the importance about good roommates and how roommates will affect our life in school. Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considered. In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. Consideration is always important in relationship. For example, roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time. Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine. At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously. Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life. It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member.Moreover, communication is as well making a good roommate. People have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning. One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project. If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk. Therefore, communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation. Through communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others.In conclusion, there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important. Consideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality. However, people might not get what they want all the time. The sky is the limit; there are all kinds of personality out there. We need to be flexible to be account into society.";Living with roommates is a common experience for many students in school or university. Having a good roommate can greatly impact both academic and personal life. In my view, the key qualities of a good roommate include respect, responsibility, and effective communication.To begin with, respect is fundamental in a roommate relationship. This means honoring each other's personal space, belongings, and study routines. For example, a thoughtful roommate won’t blast loud music or throw parties without discussing it with their roommates first, allowing everyone to concentrate on their studies. Moreover, valuing each other's unique perspectives and differences fosters a harmonious living atmosphere.In addition, responsibility is a crucial trait for a good roommate. This encompasses maintaining shared areas like the kitchen and bathroom, as well as sharing household costs. A responsible roommate contributes to chores like cleaning and laundry and pays bills on time. This keeps the living space clean and comfortable while alleviating financial stress.Finally, effective communication is vital for a positive roommate experience. This involves being open and honest about needs, concerns, and expectations. For instance, if one roommate plans a noisy gathering, they should notify their roommates in advance to reach a mutually acceptable solution. Good communication helps avoid misunderstandings and conflicts, allowing roommates to find common ground and resolve issues amicably.In summary, key qualities of a good roommate include respect, responsibility, and effective communication. These attributes are essential for fostering a positive and supportive living environment conducive to academic achievement and personal well-being. By being considerate, reliable, and communicative, roommates can cultivate a strong and harmonious relationship, enhancing their shared living experience and reducing stress.
9;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways) . Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay;Nowadays transportation has attracted much social concern. Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy. It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that governments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment. Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air. Both these two things are important.First and foremost, carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere. The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged. If governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work. This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment. Whereas, if there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released. Obviously, the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth. In addition, the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam. It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities. The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads. In order to tackle the problem, governments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes. There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion.In conclusion, I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around. Nevertheless, public transportation systems even have more important advantages. They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere. That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities.;The ongoing debate about whether governments should focus on enhancing roads and highways or improving public transportation has persisted for years. In my view, governments should allocate more funds toward public transportation options like buses, trains, and subways. A key reason for this is that enhancing public transportation can greatly alleviate traffic congestion and reduce air pollution. By offering efficient and dependable public transit, individuals are more likely to forgo their cars, leading to fewer vehicles on the road and a decline in harmful emissions.Moreover, investing in public transportation yields various economic advantages. It helps create jobs, boosts local economies, and expands access to job and educational opportunities. For example, a robust subway system can link suburban areas with city centers, simplifying commutes to work and school. Additionally, public transportation enhances the quality of life for low-income individuals who may lack access to automobiles, providing them with an affordable and reliable travel option.On the other hand, spending more on roads and highways may simply cater to the increasing number of personal vehicles, worsening traffic issues and air pollution. Furthermore, the upkeep and construction of roads often entail higher costs and more labor than developing public transportation systems. Thus, prioritizing public transport is a more cost-effective and sustainable choice for governments. By doing so, they can foster a transportation infrastructure that is environmentally friendly, economically robust, and socially equitable, benefitting all community members. In essence, investing in public transportation represents a progressive approach with lasting benefits for our environment, economy, and society.
10;Some people say that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.Ê;"Although some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics, I truly believe that the physical education part should not be outweighed. Physical exercises help to create healthy nation, assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country. First of all, the ancient Latin proverb says: ""Anima sana in corpore sano"", which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul. There is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises. The more we practice, the better we feel. Additionally, there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity: gradually, step by step we change physical condition to better. So, if the entire nation, from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday, eventually it may help to build healthy nation.Besides, when we practice outdoors and indoors sports, many aspects are getting clearer. For example, when a person goes jogging everyday, eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation. Alike, the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically. Furthermore, almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation, which is a part of physical education. Last, but not least, financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is. For instance, the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare, since the nation is comparatively healthy. Along with that, physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development. As a matter of fact, the better a person feels, the better his brain works. Therefore, putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society. As hence it ends up with financially competitive country.In the conclusion, I would like to say that the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education, the more influence we can get on academic success of students.";I strongly advocate for the inclusion of physical exercise as a mandatory component of every school day. While academic subjects are vital for a student's intellectual growth, physical activity is equally crucial for their overall wellness. Research has shown that regular exercise enhances cognitive function and concentration, which can lead to better academic outcomes. When students participate in physical activity, they tend to focus more effectively in class and retain information more efficiently.Additionally, integrating physical exercise into the school day can help address the rising rates of obesity and sedentary lifestyles among children. By requiring exercise as part of their daily routine, we encourage students to develop healthy habits early on that will benefit them throughout their lives. Physical education classes also offer students valuable opportunities to cultivate essential life skills like teamwork, communication, and discipline, which are vital for personal and professional success.On the other hand, a curriculum focused solely on academic subjects can result in student burnout and diminished motivation. A well-rounded school day that includes both academic and physical activities can help sustain students' enthusiasm for learning. Furthermore, engaging in physical exercise can act as a stress reliever and mood enhancer, which is especially important for students facing academic pressures or personal challenges.In summary, I firmly believe that physical exercise should be an essential part of every school day. The advantages of regular physical activity—such as improved academic performance, the formation of healthy habits, and the development of crucial life skills—underscore its necessity in a student's daily life. By integrating physical exercise into the school day, we can nurture well-rounded, healthy, and happy students who are prepared to thrive in all areas of life.
11;Advance in transportation and communication like the airplane and the telephone have changed the way that nations interact with each other in a global society. Choose another technological innovation that you think is important. Give specific reason for your choice.;Nowadays, everyone can see the effect of technology on their life, especially on the way of transportations and communications such as the airplane and the telephone. There are lots of other effects of growing technology on transportations and communications, which are mentioned as follows. First and foremost, email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology. Many years ago, peoples had to pay a great deal of money to post their letters, and their payements were related to the weight of their letters or boxes, and many accidents may cause problem that the post could not be delivered. But nowadays, all people can take advantage of internet to have their own email free, and send their emails to everyone in no time, besides they can be sure if their emails have been delivered or not.Another important aspect on technology is transferring money. Today, students can apply for foreign universities much easier than before. Not only with the help of sending email, but also using credit cards to pay all necessary fees online. Therefore, with the advent of internet and online paying systems, you can do many thing at your home easily.Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments. Biomedical engineers could make a significant effect on increasing life expectancy the world. For example, one of their inventions was related to artificial heart valves which can be count as a turning point in heart surgeries. In the past time doctors used pig heart's valve to implant, but the patient could not be alive more than 3 years after the replacement. But now, biomedical engineers can make artificial heart valves which works well and doctors can implant them easily. To sum up, technology has helped us to have more comfortable life. You can see its effects on transportation, communication, medicine and so forth.;The emergence of technological innovations has transformed how countries engage with one another in a global context. Beyond airplanes and telephones, the internet stands out as a pivotal advancement that has significantly influenced global interactions. It has become an essential resource for international communication, trade, and cultural exchange.I regard the internet as a key technological innovation because it has eliminated geographical barriers and facilitated immediate connectivity between nations. It has bolstered global commerce, empowering businesses to operate internationally and reach customers on a worldwide scale. E-commerce platforms and digital payment systems have enabled seamless shopping and financial transactions across borders. Additionally, the internet has promoted the sharing of ideas, cultures, and values among countries, enhancing global understanding and collaboration.Furthermore, the internet has been instrumental in advancing international diplomacy and cooperation. Governments and global organizations can now communicate and negotiate in real time, irrespective of their physical locations. This capability allows for quick responses to worldwide challenges, such as natural disasters, economic downturns, and epidemics. Moreover, the internet has democratized access to information, giving individuals the ability to obtain knowledge and news from around the globe and participate in international discussions and debates.In summary, the internet represents a transformative technological innovation in the way countries relate to one another in the global arena. Its effects on international commerce, cultural interaction, diplomacy, and information access are profound. As our world continues to grow more interconnected, the internet will remain crucial in shaping global relations and encouraging international collaboration.
12;Agree or disagree:Technology has made children less creative than they were in the past.;Technology accelerates human's evolving pace. With advanced technology, many things that seemed impossible in the past, have become realities. For example, people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen, both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet. However, some people point that technology has made children less creative. I don't deny that technology may have some negative effects on children, but I think technology makes children even more creative.First, technology inspires children to create new things. Children are curious about everything around them, so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone, they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works. For example, Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer, then he did everything he could to understand how it worked. After he had figured out all the stuff, he then began to promote the computer. In the end, he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight. Therefore, instead of interfering children's creativity, technology actually encourages children to learn and to create.Second, technology widen children's knowledge. In the past, children were only able to see things from one perspective. However, with highly advanced technology, children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends. Therefore, they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking. Knowledge is the base of creativity. The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world, inspires children and encourage them to create new things.Admittedly, technology may have negative effects on children. Technology has made life too easy for most children. In comfortable conditions, children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change. Nonetheless, with the development of technology, increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products. They kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age.;"The assertion that technology has diminished children's creativity compared to previous generations is a subject of ongoing discussion among educators and parents. While some contend that technology suppresses creative expression in children, I respectfully disagree. In fact, I argue that technology has introduced fresh avenues for creative expression.Admittedly, it is true that excessive screen time and reliance on technology can contribute to a more sedentary lifestyle and a reduction in imaginative play. Children who devote the majority of their time to video games or television might miss out on engaging activities like drawing, painting, or building with blocks. However, this limitation is not inherently tied to technology itself; rather, it stems from its usage.Conversely, technology presents children with numerous tools and resources that can effectively nurture creativity. For instance, digital art software and applications enable children to create and edit images, videos, and music in dynamic ways. Moreover, online platforms and communities offer children spaces to showcase their work, gather feedback, and collaborate with peers. Technology has also democratized access to a wealth of information and resources, which can serve as inspiration for their creative endeavors.Additionally, technology allows children to engage in creative pursuits that were previously unattainable, such as 3D modeling, animation, and coding. These activities encourage critical thinking and creativity, fostering problem-solving skills and avenues for self-expression. In summary, while technology can indeed be misused in ways that hinder creativity, I firmly believe that it holds the potential to amplify and broaden children's creative horizons. With mindful and purposeful use, children can hone their creative talents and explore innovative forms of self-expression."
13;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone. They all enrich our daily lives. Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten. And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers. It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes. They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it. In this case, students learn things easily. Moreover, they contend that good television programs do teach students. For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc.Personally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source. Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong. Just imagine: if a student can't even make out whether the source is reasonable or not, then how can he get the right information to help him to learn?;The idea that students benefit more from lessons with teachers than from other educational resources has ignited a vigorous discussion. Some contend that traditional classroom instruction is the most effective means of learning, while others argue that alternative methods, such as the internet and television, can offer equally valuable—or even superior—educational experiences. I partially disagree with this assertion.On one hand, traditional lessons led by teachers provide a distinctive learning environment that encourages engagement, interaction, and immediate feedback. Educators can adapt their teachings to address the unique needs of each student, resulting in a more personalized and effective educational experience. Additionally, teachers play a crucial role in fostering essential skills like critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication, which are vital for success in both academic and professional realms.Conversely, alternative resources such as the internet and television have grown increasingly sophisticated and accessible, offering a wide array of educational materials. The internet, in particular, hosts an immense amount of information, enabling students to delve deeply into subjects at their own pace. Furthermore, online courses, educational videos, and podcasts allow learners to benefit from the expertise of distinguished professionals and educators from around the globe. Television also provides various educational programs that can ignite curiosity and enthusiasm for diverse topics.In summary, while traditional lessons with teachers hold significant value, I believe that alternative resources can enhance and complement the educational journey. Students can gain substantial knowledge from both conventional instruction and alternative materials, and the most effective strategy is likely to combine both approaches. By utilizing the strengths of each, students can achieve a more well-rounded and engaging education that equips them for success in the 21st century.
14;Email and text messaging have transformed communication but they are seriously threatening the status of written language. How far do you agree or disagree with this statement?;The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.First of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.The popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts. Moreover, it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments. If that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand.In conclusion, we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity. Nevertheless, educators and individuals themselves, especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one.;"The rise of email and text messaging has undeniably transformed how we communicate, enhancing both the speed and convenience of information exchange. However, the idea that these technologies pose a significant threat to the integrity of written language is a matter of contention. While I recognize that there are some detrimental effects on written language, I only partially concur with this view.On one side, the prevalence of email and text messaging has contributed to a decline in formal writing skills, as individuals increasingly favor concise and casual messages. The quick nature of digital communication often leads to less emphasis on grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Additionally, the widespread use of abbreviations, acronyms, and emoticons can detract from the depth and subtlety of written language. For example, the frequent use of terms like ""btw"" and ""tbh"" may impede one's ability to convey complex ideas or nuanced emotions.Conversely, email and text messaging have also created new pathways for written communication, allowing individuals to engage with others regardless of geographical barriers. Furthermore, digital platforms have democratized writing, giving people the opportunity to articulate their thoughts and share their perspectives with a broader audience. Blogging, online journalism, and social media have opened up new channels for written expression, promoting a culture of literacy and individuality.In summary, while email and text messaging do present certain challenges to the preservation of written language, I believe that their influence is not entirely detrimental. By finding a balance between the convenience of digital communication and the need for formal writing skills, we can leverage the advantages of these technologies while safeguarding the essence of written expression. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to navigate the evolving communication landscape, using email and text messaging as means to enrich, rather than diminish, the art of writing."
15;Some people think it is acceptable to use animals for the benefit of the human beings. Some people think it is wrong to exploit animals for the human purposes. What is your opinion?;"With the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.First of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life. To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying. The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life. Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines. Furthermore, it also have potentially harm for human's health without any testing. To sum up, I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals' profits, the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits.";"The ongoing debate about the ethics of using animals for human benefit has ignited passionate discussions. While some contend that exploiting animals for human needs is justifiable, I strongly maintain that it is fundamentally wrong.Supporters of animal use often point to its role in advancing medical research, transportation, and food production, acknowledging that these practices have contributed significantly to human progress and well-being. For example, animals have played a crucial role in the development of life-saving vaccines and treatments through medical experimentation. Nevertheless, I believe that these advantages do not compensate for the suffering and distress inflicted on animals.Moreover, animals are sentient beings with emotions, needs, and rights. They possess the ability to feel pain, fear, and joy, much like humans. Treating them as mere resources for human benefit is a form of exploitation that undermines their inherent dignity and autonomy. Additionally, with the progress in technology and science, there are increasingly viable alternatives that can eliminate the need for animal exploitation.In summary, while I recognize the benefits humans have derived from using animals, I firmly assert that it is wrong to exploit them. Animals should not be viewed as commodities or instruments for human gain; they are living beings deserving of our respect, compassion, and protection. As a society, we must advocate for animal welfare and embrace more humane and sustainable practices that prioritize their dignity and well-being. By doing so, we can aspire to create a more ethical and just world for all living beings."
16;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinions.;It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television. Nowadays, number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday. Unfortunately, most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television. I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties.In spite of enjoying watching television shows, it is really time consuming task. Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising. We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities. This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday. At the end, there is no time for call to our parents or friends.Second, I think watching television programs makes us lazy. We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office. Hence, we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports. This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable.Last but not least, some television programs have a negative effect on viewers. Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity. These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers. They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors.To sum up, killing our time, making us lazy, and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive. I think it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution.;"The assertion that ""television has destroyed communication among friends and family"" is a contentious issue for many individuals. While some maintain that television has contributed to a decrease in interpersonal communication, I hold a different perspective. In my view, television has not obliterated communication; rather, it has transformed the ways in which people engage with one another.It is undeniable that excessive television viewing can diminish face-to-face interactions. For instance, when a family spends hours engrossed in a show, they might miss out on meaningful conversations and the sharing of thoughts and feelings. However, this phenomenon is not universally applicable; it largely hinges on how television is utilized. Many families leverage television as a bonding experience, discussing narratives and characters, which can ultimately strengthen their communication.Conversely, television has also introduced new avenues for interaction. With the advent of social media and streaming services, friends and family can share opinions on their favorite shows and exchange recommendations, regardless of their physical proximity. Additionally, many television programs address intricate social issues, fostering significant discussions among viewers. For example, series like ""This Is Us"" have received accolades for tackling sensitive topics such as mental health, racism, and trauma, prompting audiences to engage in dialogue and share personal experiences.In summary, while it is true that too much television can lead to a reduction in face-to-face communication, it is misleading to claim that television has annihilated communication among friends and family. Like any other medium, television serves as a tool, and its effects are contingent on how it is employed. When consumed in moderation and with intention, television can enhance communication and provide fresh avenues for people to connect and exchange ideas."
17;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field. Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work. This factor is still affecting thinking of many people. They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only. This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender.Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders. Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor. For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky. They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also. Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination. They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission. However, the current job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers. The job selection criteria are pre decided. For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine. They prefer male staff for night shifts. They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc. Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender.To conclude, I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject. Our youth has become very confident towards his career. They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations. Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer. So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal.;The idea that universities should enroll equal numbers of male and female students in every discipline has ignited significant debate. While achieving gender balance is essential for fostering equality, some contend that imposing strict quotas may not be the most effective strategy. Personally, I find merit in both sides of this argument.On one hand, ensuring equal representation of male and female students can help to close the gender gap in specific fields, particularly those like engineering and computer science, where women are often underrepresented. This move can create greater opportunities for women to explore careers in these areas, thus promoting diversity and challenging existing stereotypes. Moreover, this initiative could encourage men to engage in fields traditionally dominated by women, such as nursing and education, leading to a more inclusive and balanced educational landscape.Conversely, enforcing equal representation might result in the acceptance of less qualified candidates, which could undermine the academic integrity of the institution. Universities should focus on merit-based admissions, where students are chosen based on their academic qualifications and potential, rather than their gender. Additionally, some disciplines may inherently draw more students of one gender over the other, and attempting to artificially equalize the numbers could be counterproductive.In summary, while the proposal to enroll equal numbers of male and female students has its advantages, it is not universally applicable. Universities should aim to cultivate an environment that encourages all students, regardless of gender, to follow their academic passions. Ultimately, admissions should be driven by individual merit and potential. A more tailored approach that considers the unique needs of each discipline is likely to be more effective in advancing both gender equality and academic excellence.
18;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better?;Many young adults want to get away from their parent's houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits, to be independent. But these young people do not take into account that their lives are going to be more difficult, when they are away from home. They will have to pay a lot of bills, because they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant, who they may not like. Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money. If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan, electricity, water or even for a meal. If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working, because they will not have money to pay for everything. There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home, because parents will take care for them. Moreover, parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying.Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant, who they do not like. His habits may be totally different from theirs, his behavior may be inappropriate, but they will have to live with him or even share a room, in order to have less expenses. Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults. When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view, they will not be able to ask him for advice. Furthermore, they are most likely to quarrel every day, instead of to help each other.In conclusion, I reckon that for the young adults it will be better to live with their parents, because of the benefits they will have. They will not need to worry about financial problems or if they will get on well with their roommate.;The debate over whether young adults should strive for independence from their parents or continue living at home is a nuanced one. Personally, I contend that remaining with family for an extended period is more advantageous.On one hand, staying with parents offers young adults financial stability and security. By eliminating concerns about rent and bills, they can fully concentrate on their studies or careers without the burden of additional stress. Furthermore, living with family provides invaluable emotional support and guidance, which are crucial for young individuals facing the challenges of adulthood.Conversely, pursuing independence too soon can lead to unnecessary difficulties. Many young adults lack the essential life skills required for independent living, such as budgeting, cooking, and time management. By residing with their families, they can acquire these vital skills in a nurturing environment.Cultural and societal influences also significantly impact this decision. In various cultures, cohabiting with family is viewed as a sign of respect and responsibility, rather than a deficiency in independence. Additionally, the rising cost of living poses a considerable challenge for young adults attempting to live on their own.In summary, while pursuing independence is a vital part of maturation, I believe that living with family for a longer period can equip young adults with the support, guidance, and skills essential for success. This arrangement allows for a gradual development process and a more seamless transition into adulthood, avoiding the struggles of financial independence too early. Ultimately, the choice between seeking independence or staying with family varies by individual situation, but I strongly advocate for the numerous benefits of remaining with family during these formative years.
19;Some people believe that the government is responsible for cleaning up the environment while other people belief it should be the responsibility of companies and private individuals. Whats you opinion? ;Air pollution is an issue threatening the environment in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the negative way. I believe that more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution. First, in most industrialized countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions. The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution. While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses, most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution. If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution, they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause.Second, private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating. As house heating is a major need in the winter time, some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes. Instead of this, some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution. In my opinion, by charging private individuals for causing air pollution, that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution. On the other hand, I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies. Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air, instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals. In conclusion, due to the fact that governments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution, both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution.;The discussion about who should be accountable for environmental cleanup has ignited passionate debate among individuals, businesses, and governments. Some contend that the government should take the initiative in protecting the environment, while others argue that companies and private citizens ought to shoulder this responsibility. In my view, the duty of cleaning up the environment should be a collective one, shared by all parties involved.On one side, governments possess the authority and resources necessary to establish policies and regulations that can significantly diminish pollution and safeguard natural resources. They have the power to enforce laws, allocate funding for environmental initiatives, and raise public awareness about the importance of conservation. Thus, it is reasonable to expect governments to assume a leading role in environmental protection.Conversely, businesses and private citizens also play vital roles in this effort. Companies can implement sustainable practices, minimize waste, and invest in renewable energy sources. At the same time, individuals can make mindful choices in their everyday lives, such as cutting down on plastic use, conserving water, and recycling. Additionally, both businesses and individuals can contribute to environmental causes through donations and volunteer efforts.In summary, the task of cleaning up the environment is a shared responsibility that necessitates the involvement of governments, businesses, and private citizens alike. Instead of placing the burden on a single entity, we should unite in our efforts to safeguard our planet. By collaborating, we can combine our resources, expertise, and knowledge for a more significant impact. Ultimately, it is through a joint commitment that we can secure a sustainable and environmentally-friendly future for generations to come.
20;High sales of a product are mainly due to good advertisment strategies. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;Everyday, companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers. The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising. However, it is not sufficient in itself. The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers. In my opinion, advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons. We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements. Therefore, advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product. When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised, they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases. Recently, there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV. The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot. As a result of this, the number of that product being sold will increases. Also, the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media, the more popular the product becomes. Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product. Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product. When a product is commonly used, it becomes trustworthy for the society, no matter what quality it is. However, it also has to be affordable for the consumer. Considering this fact, advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised. They make the product preferable. In conclusion, as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods, high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements.;The idea that strong sales figures for a product result mainly from effective advertising strategies has prompted considerable discussion. While advertising undeniably plays an important role in increasing sales, I believe this statement holds only partial truth.On one side, well-executed advertising strategies can significantly enhance sales performance. Effective advertising raises brand awareness, educates potential customers about the product, and fosters an emotional connection with the target demographic. For example, a compelling advertisement can generate excitement around a new product, capturing interest and driving sales. Companies like Coca-Cola and Nike have demonstrated success in using advertising to establish memorable brand identities and enhance sales.Conversely, high sales can also stem from various other factors, including product quality, pricing, distribution channels, and customer service. A product that lacks quality or is priced too high will struggle to achieve strong sales, regardless of how well it is advertised. Additionally, positive word-of-mouth, often fueled by outstanding customer service, can significantly influence sales figures. In the current digital landscape, social media and online reviews wield considerable power over consumer purchasing decisions, sometimes surpassing the effects of traditional advertising.Moreover, some products naturally attract consumer interest due to their novelty, necessity, or cultural significance, leading to strong sales irrespective of advertising efforts. For instance, an innovative tech gadget may sell well due to its cutting-edge features rather than solely because of its promotional campaign.In summary, while effective advertising strategies are undoubtedly vital for driving sales, they are not the exclusive factor in achieving high sales figures. Product quality, pricing, customer service, and additional elements also play crucial roles. Consequently, attributing high sales primarily to effective advertising is an oversimplification. A holistic approach that takes multiple influencing factors into account is essential for attaining and maintaining robust sales success.
21;Some people believe a country will benefit greatly by a high percentage of young people go to university. Others argue that it only leads to unemployment. Discuss both and give your own opinion.;"Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university. In regard to the development of the country, some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities, while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment. In this essay, I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.To begin with, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons. From their point of view, the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, and, furthermore, labors for graduates are in short supply. What is worse, the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying. In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming.However, on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine. These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world. More importantly, many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society. Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships.To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities' education have reasonable justifications; however, I agree with the latter view. Although higher education does not guarantee young students' success, the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges.";The debate over whether a high percentage of young individuals pursuing higher education is advantageous for a country has become increasingly intense. On one side, proponents argue that an influx of university-educated youth can yield significant advantages. They contend that higher education equips students with critical skills, knowledge, and analytical abilities essential for economic advancement. A knowledgeable workforce fosters innovation and entrepreneurship, leading to the creation of new job opportunities and contributing to overall economic development.Conversely, critics assert that an elevated percentage of young people in university may result in unemployment. They note that the job market might struggle to accommodate the influx of graduates, creating a surplus of skilled workers competing for a limited number of positions. This scenario can lead to frustration and disillusionment among graduates, who may feel their university experiences have not translated into viable career prospects.In my view, while a high percentage of young people attending university can be advantageous, it is vital to ensure that educational programs are aligned with market demands. Governments and educational institutions should collaborate to equip students with applicable skills and training while working to generate job opportunities that correspond to graduates' capabilities. By adopting this approach, a country can harness the benefits of a well-educated workforce while mitigating the risks of unemployment. Ultimately, a balanced strategy that considers both economic needs and job market realities is essential for maximizing the advantages of higher education for young individuals.
22;There are social, medical and technical problems associated with the use of mobile phones. What form do these problems take? Do problems of using mobile phones outweigh the benefits?;Nowadays, the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well, such as social, medical and technical problems. However, I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones. In this essay, I would like to analyze these three issues in order to support my viewpoint.First of all, almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems. Mobile phones are not out of expectation. Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas, such as schools, libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive. What is worse, some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other. Nevertheless, it is not impossible to solve these problems, as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented.It is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal. It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers, although the further investigation are needed.Another debatable problem is about techniques. There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party. This possibility exists all the time. But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users.Moreover, the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people's daily life. Not only used for communication, but it also functions as an Internet browser, a music player, a personal organizer and so forth.In conclusion, nothing can be overused without side effects. The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people's dependence on it is irreversible, although it has a number of problems that should be well handled.;"Mobile phones have become an essential aspect of contemporary life, with billions of people worldwide depending on them for communication, entertainment, and access to information. However, this growing reliance has also led to various social, health, and technical challenges.Socially, mobile phones contribute to reduced face-to-face interactions, increased distractions, and a rise in cyberbullying. Many individuals find themselves engaging more with their devices than with one another, which undermines the development of deep, meaningful relationships. Additionally, the persistent notifications and alerts can disrupt focus, resulting in accidents, diminished productivity, and negative effects on mental well-being.From a medical standpoint, mobile phones are linked to several health concerns, such as radiation exposure, insufficient sleep, and eye strain. The World Health Organization has classified the radiofrequency electromagnetic fields produced by mobile devices as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans."" Furthermore, the blue light emitted from screens can inhibit melatonin production, leading to sleep disorders and related health issues.On the technical side, mobile phones face risks from hacking, data breaches, and other cyber threats. As more personal information is stored on these devices, the likelihood of identity theft and financial fraud rises. Additionally, the rapid obsolescence of mobile phones contributes to a growing problem of electronic waste, further exacerbating environmental pollution.While it's essential to recognize these challenges, we must also consider the numerous advantages of mobile phones, which include enhanced connectivity, ready access to information, and convenience. To ensure that mobile phone usage is safe, responsible, and sustainable, it is vital to acknowledge and address these concerns. By understanding these issues and taking proactive steps to mitigate them, we can enjoy the benefits of mobile phones while minimizing their adverse effects. Ultimately, a balanced approach to mobile phone use is crucial for ensuring that the advantages outweigh the drawbacks."
23;Using computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on your children? do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, thanks to the development of technology, computer is now indispensable to life. Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently. In my opinion, the latter opinion is true.First, using computer constantly has bad influence on children's eyes. When they concentrate on computer for too long, their eyes will get tired, which is the main reason for some eyes problems, typically shortsighted.Moreover, children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills, they will know little about the outside life. It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear dangerous consequences. For instance, several teenagers play games without rest, which leads to health depression, a typical example is the death of Korean gamer, who had a non-stop playing for 3 days.Finally, even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much. Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose, most of them are attracted by facebook, blog, etc. instead. Due to this neglect, they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet, they will have no time for their studying.In conclusion, although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life, it still has its bad side, especially for children. People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose.;Computers have become a vital aspect of everyday life, and children are not excluded from this trend. Although they provide a wealth of information and educational resources, I believe that daily computer usage can result in more harm than good for children.On one hand, computers offer children access to a wide range of educational content, help improve their typing skills, and expand their knowledge across various subjects. However, the drawbacks of excessive computer use significantly outweigh these advantages. Prolonged screen time can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, increasing the risk of obesity and other health issues. Moreover, it can foster social isolation, as children often engage more with screens than they do with their friends and family.Additionally, too much time spent on computers can negatively impact children’s cognitive and emotional growth. It may shorten their attention spans as they face endless distractions and notifications, making sustained focus on tasks challenging. Moreover, the easy availability of violent and explicit material online can adversely affect their emotional health and moral compass.In summary, while computers can be powerful tools for education and personal growth, their overuse can lead to more negative outcomes than positive ones for children. Therefore, it's essential for parents and caregivers to monitor and limit computer use, promote physical activities, and encourage social interactions and outdoor play. By doing this, we can enable children to benefit from computers while reducing their potential pitfalls.
24;Large factory near your community. Advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community.;Nowadays, whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society. Out of the case of economic development, industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society. However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution. From my point of view, the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories.First of all, a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. To manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit. What is more, the factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area. For example, the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need.The main disadvantage is contamination. It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems. For instance, in some industrial cities, a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances.However, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. Therefore, how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it. In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well.In conclusion, installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries. Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way.;The construction of a large factory near our community has introduced both benefits and drawbacks. On the positive side, the factory has generated numerous job opportunities for local residents, leading to a decrease in unemployment rates and a boost to the local economy. Many families are now enjoying the financial stability that these jobs provide, resulting in an overall improvement in the community's standard of living.Moreover, the factory has played a role in enhancing the area's infrastructure, including roads, transportation systems, and utilities. This development has made commuting to work, school, and essential services more convenient, thereby improving the quality of life for residents. Additionally, the factory has attracted various businesses and services, such as restaurants, shops, and entertainment venues, enriching the social and cultural fabric of our community.However, the factory's establishment has also brought about certain negative consequences. A primary concern is the environmental pollution stemming from its operations. The resulting air and water contamination has adversely affected the health and wellbeing of local residents, particularly vulnerable groups like the elderly and young children. Furthermore, the noise and increased traffic from the factory have disrupted the peaceful atmosphere, making it challenging for residents to relax and enjoy their homes.Additionally, the influx of new workers and their families has placed considerable pressure on local resources, including schools, healthcare facilities, and housing. The community has faced difficulties in adapting to this heightened demand for services. In summary, while the large factory near our community has provided numerous advantages, it is crucial to address and mitigate its negative impacts to ensure that the community can thrive and benefit from industrial development while preserving a healthy and sustainable environment.
25;Food is now easier to prepare. Is this a good thing?;Nowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.First of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food. Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up.In addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.In conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing. Cooking is not a waste of time, contrarily, it is crucial for our health and culture.;The emergence of modern technology and culinary advancements has significantly simplified food preparation. With the popularity of pre-packaged meals, microwave-ready dishes, and online recipe resources, the time and effort involved in cooking have been dramatically decreased. While this convenience is undoubtedly advantageous, it's important to consider the broader implications of this trend.On one side, the simplicity of preparing food offers a variety of benefits. It saves valuable time, enabling individuals to dedicate more hours to work, leisure, or personal growth. Additionally, pre-packaged meals and meal delivery services enhance accessibility to nutritious options for those with hectic schedules or minimal cooking skills. This shift has improved food availability and decreased the reliance on unhealthy fast-food alternatives.Conversely, the growing dependence on convenient food preparation has its drawbacks. Over-relying on pre-packaged and processed foods can result in diminished cooking skills and an increase in unhealthy ingredient consumption. The environmental concerns associated with single-use packaging and the carbon footprint of meal delivery services are also significant. Moreover, the erosion of traditional cooking practices and the cultural importance of food preparation may be jeopardized as people turn increasingly towards convenient, often impersonal, meal options.In summary, while the ease of food preparation has clear benefits, finding a balance between convenience and its potential drawbacks is essential. By being intentional about our food choices and occasionally cooking from scratch, we can reap the rewards of convenient meal options while also preserving traditional culinary techniques and fostering a healthier, more sustainable approach to food.
26;The best and only way to assist developing countries is to provide them with financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;As is commonly understood, there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries. It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries. However, it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries. This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters.Firstly, education is an essential part in development. For instance, most developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities. From this example, it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support. Thus, the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid.In addition, it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world. This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market. Indeed, they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas. Therefore, developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries.In conclusion, financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries. And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation.;I contest the notion that providing financial aid is the best and only method to support developing countries. While financial aid can play a significant role in fostering development, it is not a comprehensive solution to the various challenges these nations face. In fact, relying solely on financial assistance can foster dependency and weaken a country's ability to build a robust economy.In the short term, financial aid can help alleviate poverty, fund infrastructure projects, and ensure access to essentials like food and shelter. However, it fails to tackle the root causes of underdevelopment, such as inadequate education, ineffective governance, and restricted access to technology. Excessive reliance on financial aid can nurture a dependency culture, preventing countries from cultivating their economic self-sufficiency.There are indeed more effective ways to assist developing countries in the long term. For example, offering technical assistance, sharing expertise, and supporting capacity building can empower nations to establish their own institutions and systems. Additionally, fostering trade and investment can generate jobs, drive economic growth, and reduce poverty.In summary, while financial aid can certainly be helpful in supporting a nation's development, it is not the only avenue available for aiding developing countries. A more holistic approach, which includes technical support, capacity enhancement, and trade promotion, is likely to be more effective in achieving sustainable development and alleviating poverty. Hence, I firmly disagree with the statement and advocate for a multifaceted strategy to genuinely assist these nations in their development journey.
27;Society should ban all forms of the advertising because it has no purpose and causes damages. Do you agree or disagree? ;It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life. We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday. Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing. Other critics say that ads have no purpose, they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned. On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way. Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers.First of all, I do support the idea that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children. Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis. Fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.On the other hand by advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services. Thanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose what’s the best for us.These days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising. For example, tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy. In order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers. Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country.In conclusion, I think that modern society needs advertising. Ads will keep us well informed about new products and services, but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way.;I firmly oppose the idea that society should completely eliminate all forms of advertising. Although it's true that some advertising can be misleading or detrimental, it oversimplifies the issue to claim that advertising serves no purpose and only inflicts harm. In fact, advertising is essential to both the economy and society, functioning as a key communication channel between businesses and consumers.On one side, advertising delivers important information about goods and services, allowing consumers to make informed choices. It stimulates competition among companies, which in turn drives innovation and enhances product quality. Additionally, advertising generates substantial revenue for media organizations, which supports content creation and the spread of information.On the flip side, it’s recognized that some advertising can lead to negative outcomes, like endorsing unhealthy lifestyles or fostering materialism. However, instead of implementing an outright ban on advertising, a more effective approach would be to establish regulations and standards that ensure accuracy and respectfulness in advertising. This strategy would help retain the advantages of advertising while reducing its potential negative impacts.Moreover, a comprehensive ban on advertising could lead to unintended consequences, such as curtailing freedom of expression and hindering economic development. A more reasonable course of action would be to promote responsible advertising practices and educate consumers to critically assess the ads they encounter. In summary, while advertising does have its downsides, it is not devoid of purpose or inherently harmful. A balanced strategy that encourages responsible advertising and informed consumer choices is a far more prudent solution than an all-encompassing prohibition.
28;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think that women should work to earn money whereas other people belief that women should care about household. What's your opinion?;Personally, I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly. Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household. I will mention some basic reasons as following.Firstly, extra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses. By taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life. This is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present. So, it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money.Secondly, working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity. These things in turn will make them more confident, independent. These women will set a good example for their children. Therefore, it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better.Last but not least, nowadays, there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work. Besides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women.In conclusion, a well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home.;The role of women in society has evolved significantly over the years, resulting in far greater opportunities today than in the past. While some argue that women's primary focus should be on earning a living, others contend that their main responsibility is managing the household. I firmly believe that women should have the liberty to choose between working and homemaking, as both roles hold equal importance and value.On one side, women who opt to work outside the home contribute an additional income that can enhance their families' standard of living. Additionally, working women have the chance to pursue their passions, improve their skills, and achieve a sense of independence and self-fulfillment, which positively influences their mental and emotional health.Conversely, women who decide to manage the household are vital in nurturing and educating their children, overseeing domestic tasks, and providing emotional support within the family. Although this role is often overlooked and undervalued, it is crucial for the overall well-being and stability of the family unit.In conclusion, I believe that women should have the freedom to make their own choices regarding their societal roles. Whether they decide to work, focus on homemaking, or balance both responsibilities, their decisions should be met with respect and support. By expanding opportunities and choices for women, we can foster a more equitable society where everyone can flourish and realize their full potential. Embracing and appreciating the diversity of women's roles will enable us to move toward a brighter, more inclusive future for all.
29;The government has to provide primary and secondary education, but for university education either students or their parents should pay. To what extent do you agree?;"Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world. I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people; however, for the more higher education like university, the students or their parents should pay for the fees.Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees. In the other hand, I don't think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students' primary and secondary education. It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education.Moreover, students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it. They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves. In addition to that, the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well.Furthermore, this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future.In conclusion, I completely agree that government should not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them.";The discussion surrounding responsibility for university education costs has become increasingly heated in recent years. While some advocate for entirely free university education provided by the government, I partially support the idea that students or their parents should shoulder some of the financial burden.On one hand, free university education presents a range of advantages. It can foster a more educated and skilled workforce, contributing positively to the nation’s economic growth and development. Additionally, it can enhance social mobility and equality by granting students from low-income families equal opportunities to pursue higher education. However, the financial implications of such a system can be substantial for the government, potentially diverting funds from other critical public services, such as healthcare and infrastructure.Conversely, requiring students or their parents to finance education can yield several benefits. It may motivate students to engage more deeply with their studies and recognize the value of their education. This system also cultivates a sense of personal responsibility and accountability among learners. Furthermore, many universities depend on tuition fees to sustain their operations, and without these contributions, they might face challenges in delivering high-quality education and resources.In conclusion, while I appreciate the necessity of making higher education accessible to everyone, I believe that students or their families should bear some of its costs. Nonetheless, the government can play an essential role by offering financial aid to those who struggle to cover tuition expenses, through scholarships, grants, and low-interest loans. This approach allows those willing to invest in their education to do so, while also ensuring that less fortunate students can access higher education. Ultimately, a balanced strategy that considers the needs of both the government and students is crucial for making university education both accessible and affordable for all.
30;The first car appeared on British roads in 1888. By the year 2000 there may be as many as 29million vehicles on British roads. Alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Recently, a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation. Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation, while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution. In my opinion, I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced. In this essay, several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages.Firstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. Therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.Secondly, an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion. Once we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while. What is worse, traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents. Thus, the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented.In order to solve these problems, alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively. With regard to the former, alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal. For example, rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries. This system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee. Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, it is a better form to protect environment than automobile. As for the latter point, the introduction of international laws can be also effective. For instance, there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only. Thus, these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution.In summary, even though some people claim the convenience of automobile, I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion.;The rise of automobiles on British roads has been remarkable, increasing from just one vehicle in 1888 to an anticipated 29 million by the year 2000. This rapid expansion has sparked worries regarding the environmental, social, and economic implications of car dependency. Given these challenges, I believe it is crucial to promote alternative transportation methods and implement international regulations to manage car ownership and usage.Car dependency has significant negative effects on the environment, such as air and noise pollution, as well as greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, the high volume of vehicles leads to traffic congestion, increased accidents, and heightened stress levels. By advocating for alternative modes of transport like cycling, walking, and public transit, we can greatly alleviate these issues. Governments and local agencies should invest in the necessary infrastructure—such as bike paths, pedestrian-friendly areas, and reliable public transport systems—to encourage these alternatives.Moreover, the establishment of international regulations could play a vital role in mitigating the adverse effects of car culture. Such regulations might focus on emission standards, fuel efficiency, and safety benchmarks, while also fostering car-sharing, ride-sharing, and other collaborative transport solutions. By managing the number of cars on the roads and promoting more sustainable transport options, we can develop healthier, more livable urban environments and reduce our carbon emissions.It's important to recognize, however, that for many individuals, particularly in rural locations with limited public transport options, cars will continue to be a necessary means of travel. Therefore, any regulations or laws implemented must be thoughtfully balanced, taking into account the diverse needs of different communities. In conclusion, I firmly advocate for the encouragement of alternative transportation options and the introduction of international laws to regulate car ownership and use, as this approach will foster a more sustainable, environmentally responsible, and equitable transportation framework.
31;Rich countries should provide financial help to poor contries. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;"In this world, there is no one who does not know this world 'globalization', which means the world are more closer, and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways. That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries. It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries. In addition, a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries. However, I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons.First of all, poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer. To be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies. Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business. In actual, republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's. Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties.Secondly, aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people. If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted. It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization.Third, the campaigns might include practical benefits. In globalized world, the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others. When America mortgage loan system went bad, several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated, even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt.In conclusion, there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people, keeping strong global economy. I strongly believe that being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers, and it will make the earth a better place to live.";The discussion surrounding financial assistance from wealthy nations to poorer ones has generated considerable debate. In my view, I support the idea that affluent countries should extend financial aid to those in need, though I believe this support should come with specific conditions.On one hand, providing financial aid to developing nations can greatly contribute to reducing poverty and fostering economic development. Wealthy countries have a moral duty to assist those less fortunate, and such assistance can lead to a more stable and prosperous global economy. Furthermore, financial support can facilitate crucial development initiatives, such as enhancing education, healthcare, and infrastructure, all of which are vital for a nation's long-term progress.Conversely, critics argue that financial aid can foster dependency and hinder the recipient country's ability to establish a self-sustaining economy. There's also the concern that aid might be misappropriated or wasted by corrupt governments, potentially worsening poverty and inequality. However, I believe these concerns can be addressed by making aid contingent upon good governance, accountability, and transparency.In conclusion, I advocate for wealthy countries to provide financial assistance to poorer nations, but with careful deliberation and established conditions. This approach can help alleviate poverty, encourage economic growth, and foster sustainable development. Ultimately, the aim of aid should be to empower developing nations to achieve self-sufficiency and economic autonomy, rather than fostering reliance. Through responsible and effective assistance, affluent countries can play a crucial role in reducing global poverty and promoting a fairer and more prosperous world.
32;Even though globalization affects the world's economics in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"During the history of the world, every change has its own positive and negative sides. Globalization as a gradual change affecting all over the world is not an exception. Although it has undeniable effects on the economics of the world; it has side effects which make it a controversial issue.Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country. They think that the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments.Those who disagree, believe that globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects. Developing globalization, people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world. In addition, they admit that globalization can be considered a chance for people of each country to promote their lifestyle through the stuffs and services imported from other countries.Moreover, the proponents of globalization idea point out globalization results in considerable decrease in global tension due to convergence of benefits of people of the world which is a natural consequence of globalization.In conclusion, I would rather classify myself in the proponents of globalization as a speeding factor of global progress. I think it is more likely to solve the problems of the world rather than intensifying them.";The rise of globalization has transformed the global economy, leading to unprecedented growth and deeper connections between nations. While it is clear that globalization has brought significant benefits to the economy, it is essential to recognize its negative repercussions as well.On one side, globalization has opened doors for international trade, investment, and cultural exchange. It has allowed countries to focus on their strengths, as suggested by David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage, enhancing efficiency and productivity. This has resulted in greater economic growth, lower prices, and improved living standards for millions globally. Additionally, globalization has made it easier for technology, knowledge, and innovation to flow, helping developing nations catch up to their more developed counterparts.Conversely, globalization has attracted criticism for its harmful effects on local industries, job markets, and the environment. The influx of inexpensive imports has led to declines in domestic manufacturing, resulting in job losses and economic turmoil in various countries. Furthermore, the search for cheaper labor and resources has often led to the exploitation of workers in developing nations, exacerbating poverty and inequality. The heightened transportation and consumption associated with globalization have also contributed to environmental harm and climate change.In summary, while globalization has undeniably benefited the world economy, its negative impacts must not be overlooked. Policymakers and international organizations must recognize and address these issues to ensure that the advantages of globalization are distributed fairly and sustainably among all nations and peoples. By doing this, we can reduce the negative consequences of globalization and work towards a fairer and more prosperous global community for everyone.
33;Many children are forced to stay at school and study subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. These children may disrupt the education of the majority and should be allowed to leave school early to find a themselves a job. What are your views?;Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future. Others, however, think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school.First of all, schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying. It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things. Second of all, schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students. Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences. Therefore, they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future. For example, as we know, employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills.Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job. Whether children can learn a lot at school, there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. Furthermore, children can learn social skills when they have a job. They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school. Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned.Overall, I believe that students should study at school. Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job, studying at school is always the best choice for children's future. There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job.;The idea that children who show little interest in academics should be permitted to leave school early to pursue employment has ignited a vigorous debate. Proponents argue that compelling students to remain in an educational setting against their will can negatively impact their well-being as well as the overall learning atmosphere. Disruptive behavior from disengaged students can obstruct the educational experience for their motivated peers. Allowing these students to exit school early could enable them to seek jobs that align with their skills and interests, possibly leading to a more satisfying and productive life.Conversely, it is important to weigh the long-term consequences of leaving school prematurely. In today's competitive job landscape, insufficient education can severely restrict career opportunities and earning potential. Additionally, skills and knowledge gained in school—such as reading, math, and critical thinking—are crucial for success in most professions. Departing from school early may place students at a considerable disadvantage, increasing the likelihood of unemployment or relegating them to low-paying, low-skilled positions.Instead of allowing students to exit school early, it could be more advantageous to develop alternative educational pathways tailored to various interests and learning styles. Vocational training programs, apprenticeships, and online courses can offer students a sense of purpose and direction while equipping them with the skills needed for success in their chosen careers. Ultimately, it is vital to find a balance between meeting the diverse needs of students and ensuring they acquire the essential knowledge and skills necessary for their future success.
34;Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we can see advertisements everywhere, from television set to posters on the streets. Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television. I tend to agree with this view.To boost their sales and win over customers, companies pour a great amount of money into advertising. Most of the time, it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product. By which I mean, huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product. By casting famous singers in their television advertisement, motorcycles or clothes for example, sales increase significantly since youngsters, as the target consumers, love celebrities. Since having these products shows their status, the quality obviously is not relatively important.However, despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated, it is also true that it plays and important role economically. They introduce new products, and provide various choices, not to mention they are often visually enjoyable, since they aim to grab your attention. Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels, creates a fair environment for commercial competition. Otherwise the market may be monopolistic, and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective.The power of advertising maybe over-rated, we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers. No matter how appealing the advertisements are, we should be able to make the decision on our own.;The idea that robust sales of popular consumer products are primarily influenced by advertising, rather than genuine societal needs, has ignited considerable discussion. While I recognize that advertising significantly shapes consumer preferences, I only partially concur with this perspective.On one hand, advertising has become a crucial instrument for businesses, enabling them to generate demand and sway consumer behavior. Through innovative marketing strategies, companies can cultivate a perceived need for certain products, even when they may not be essential. The booming sales of luxury items, such as high-fashion apparel and exquisite jewelry, exemplify this trend. In such cases, the surge in sales can be largely attributed to successful advertising campaigns that foster a desire for these items among consumers.Conversely, I contend that advertising is not the sole factor driving sales. Numerous consumer products, including food, personal care items, and electronics, are vital for everyday living, and their sales reflect authentic societal needs. For example, the widespread popularity of smartphones stems from their practical utility and functionality, rather than advertising alone. These devices are essential for communication, information access, and various daily tasks, making them indispensable in today’s world.In summary, while advertising undoubtedly plays a crucial role in boosting sales, it is not the only determinant. The interplay between advertising and sales is intricate, and the degree to which advertising impacts sales can differ based on the product and its relevance. Ultimately, it is a blend of both advertising efforts and genuine societal needs that governs the sales of consumer goods.
35;Why should the ownership of guns be limited?;Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries. However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others. Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns. The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns. For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting. So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.Secondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people. Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues. Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting. What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.Thirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide. In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent. Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.In conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.;The discussion around gun ownership has been a complex and divisive topic for a long time. Supporters emphasize that the right to bear arms is vital for personal liberty and safety, while opponents argue for restrictions due to the inherent dangers and repercussions of gun ownership. In this essay, I will present the case for limiting gun ownership.A primary concern regarding unrestricted access to firearms is the heightened risk of gun violence and accidents. With guns readily accessible, the chances of their involvement in violent crimes or unintentional shootings increase significantly. By imposing limits on gun ownership, we could reduce the overall number of firearms available, thus minimizing the potential for harm. Furthermore, research has demonstrated a connection between easy access to guns and elevated rates of homicide, suicide, and domestic violence.Additionally, restricting gun ownership can prevent firearms from getting into the hands of those who should not possess them, including criminals, children, or individuals with a history of mental health issues. Implementing stricter background checks and licensing procedures would help ensure that only responsible and law-abiding individuals are allowed to own guns. This would contribute to a safer and more secure environment for everyone.Moreover, countries that have adopted stringent gun control measures have experienced significant declines in gun-related deaths and injuries. For instance, after Australia enacted strict gun regulations in 1996, there was a notable drop in gun-related homicides. This evidence suggests that limiting gun access can positively influence public safety and overall well-being.In summary, while the right to bear arms is an important facet of personal freedom, it is crucial to balance this privilege with the imperative of protecting public safety. By restricting gun ownership, we can help decrease gun violence, keep firearms away from dangerous individuals, and foster a safer society. It is vital for governments to proactively regulate gun ownership and strive to cultivate a more secure and peaceful world.
36;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;International sporting events are a good change to create a multi-nation community of fans having the same passion. It will help people around the world understand each other more. Since, international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.An international sporting event is normal held in a country with huge interest from fans all over the world. For the time of occasions, people regardless of nationality, origin and religion will live together. People can understand more about a country, it is useful to ease tensions between nations. For example in FIFA World Cup 2010, the relation between North Korea and South Korea is dangerous for the warship sinking. The world suspected North Korea of the aggressive action. However, due to this event North Korea showed a friendship and enthuasism. It is rare times when people can learn about this country. It really help to alleviate the tension.Besides easing tensions, an international sporting event also helps fans release patriotic emotions in a safe way. When they garther together to encourage their team, they will show their patriotic emotions. Regardless of the competition between teams, their emotions are always released in a safe way due to the sole passion of the sport. Moreover, all fans know that a sport event will attract the attention of whole the world and a lot of public media. They will try to create a beautiful image about their land and people. In Olympic Beijing 2008, Chinese tried thier best to bring the world a spectacular image about their country. First of all, foreigners came here always received the support of friendly volunteers who were young students. They were welcomed by each Chinese hospitality, beauty in each cities. Everythings is created by patriotic emotions of Chinese who wanted to bring a beautiful China to the world.In conclusion, International sporting events will draw the international concern. It will make the world more peaceful by easing internation tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.;The assertion that major events like the football World Cup and other international sports competitions are crucial for alleviating international tensions and safely channeling patriotic feelings is a subject of contention. While I acknowledge that these events can have beneficial effects, I also contend that their influence can be limited and, at times, even counterproductive.On one hand, the football World Cup and comparable international sporting events create opportunities for countries to unite and share a collective experience. The excitement and camaraderie these events generate can help promote a sense of global community and common humanity, potentially reducing international tensions. Furthermore, the patriotic sentiments stirred during these occasions can serve as a healthy and harmless outlet for national pride.Conversely, the fierce rivalries and nationalist fervor that often accompany these events can intensify existing tensions and even lead to new conflicts. For example, interactions among fans from various countries can escalate into violence and hostility, undermining the prospects for international understanding and collaboration. Additionally, the vast resources and focus devoted to these events can divert attention from more urgent global issues that necessitate collective action.In summary, while international sporting events like the football World Cup do hold the potential to ease international tensions and offer a safe avenue for patriotic expression, their impact should not be exaggerated. These events represent just one element of the complex landscape of international relations and global citizenship, and their effects can be intricate and varied. Ultimately, a more nuanced perspective on the role of sports in international relations is essential for fully understanding both their advantages and limitations.
37;Some people believe that the range of technology available to individuals today is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people, while others say that technology has the opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Technology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.In the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one. Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies. Thus, most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people.Secondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.Undoubtedly, everything has two sides and technology is not an exception. To some extent, the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology, because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return. Nevertheless, I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap.In conclusion, the good technology bringing to us is undeniable. Under proper use of technology, the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it.;The influence of technology on the socioeconomic divide has led to significant discussions in recent years. On one side, some argue that the expanding array of technological resources is exacerbating the disparity between the wealthy and the less fortunate. They maintain that individuals with more financial means can access the latest, most advanced technologies, boosting their productivity and, consequently, their wealth. Conversely, those from lower socioeconomic statuses often find it difficult to afford even basic technological tools, limiting their ability to compete in today's economy.On the flip side, others contend that technology serves as a unifying force, helping to close the gap between the affluent and the impoverished. They posit that advancements like the internet and mobile devices have opened the door for people across various backgrounds to access a wealth of information, educational materials, and job prospects. For example, online platforms have democratized education and employment opportunities, allowing individuals to develop new skills and attain better-paying jobs, regardless of their circumstances.In my view, technology possesses the capacity to either widen or narrow the socioeconomic divide, depending on its application and distribution. Nevertheless, with appropriate policies and initiatives, such as affordable access to technology and digital literacy programs, I believe technology can be an effective instrument for diminishing inequality. By equipping individuals with the necessary skills and resources to engage in the digital economy, technology can empower marginalized communities and promote greater social mobility. Ultimately, it is our duty to ensure the equitable distribution of technology's benefits and to maximize its potential to bridge the gap between the affluent and the disadvantaged.
38;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;For many centuries, outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study. Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful. However, a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money, to illustrate, astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment. On the other hand, there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space.Firstly, many facts about solar system can be discovered. For instance, a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat. Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa. If it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts.Secondly, people can know more about the planet earth itself. By observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth. With this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming.Finally, a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented. As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks. Oxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater. Moreover, spaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society.As a conclusion, I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space. In spite of costing a fortune, space exploration has given aforementioned benefits.;Government investment in outer space exploration has ignited significant debate in recent years. While some critics claim that the extensive funds allocated to space travel are squandered, I firmly maintain that this investment is both reasonable and warranted.To begin with, space exploration has resulted in numerous groundbreaking discoveries and innovations that have profoundly benefited our society. For example, satellite technology, developed through space research, has transformed communication, enabling global connectivity and enhancing international trade. Additionally, advancements in space medicine have deepened our understanding of the human body and led to new treatments for various diseases.Furthermore, space exploration holds the promise of unlocking new resources and avenues for economic growth. With the global population on the rise, the demand for essential resources such as food, water, and energy is surging. Space exploration has the potential to address these challenges by tapping into resources available on other planets and celestial bodies. For instance, NASA's initiative to return humans to the moon by 2024 could pave the way for discovering new mineral deposits that could support human needs on Earth.Lastly, investing in space exploration can yield significant long-term environmental benefits. By exploring and gaining insight into the universe, we can enhance our understanding of Earth's formation and evolution, ultimately aiding our efforts to combat climate change and safeguard the environment. Furthermore, space-based technologies, such as solar panels and renewable energy systems, can provide sustainable solutions to our energy demands, reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and lowering carbon emissions.In conclusion, although investing in outer space exploration may appear costly, I strongly argue that it constitutes a rational and essential expenditure. The potential advantages of space research, from expanding our knowledge of the universe to discovering new resources and fostering economic growth, make it an investment that is certainly worthwhile.
39;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In present day and age, students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university. This phenomenon, although in some extents, are proved to have negative effects, I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages. In this essay, some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained.It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs. Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities. In addition, that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities. As a result, students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience. Moreover, having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation.Secondly, students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones. By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained. Also, working conditions require students the independency in thinking, working, and solving problems, which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities.Lastly, doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation. Indeed, high studying tuition, added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students. With the money they earn from extra jobs, which normally is not much, those difficulties could be partially solved. Moreover, that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life.In conclusion, I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits. By taking on an extra job, students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience, confidence and accommodation. It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future.;The idea of teenagers working while studying is a topic of discussion in many nations. Personally, I believe that having a job can be advantageous for teens, but it largely depends on individual circumstances. On one side, a part-time job can offer teenagers important work experience, develop their skills, and instill a sense of responsibility. It can also enhance their time management abilities as they learn to juggle their studies with their work obligations. Additionally, earning their own money can help them understand the significance of budgeting and financial management.Furthermore, engaging in work can expand their social networks, allowing them to interact with colleagues and customers from various backgrounds. Many part-time working students report increased confidence and independence, as they contribute to their family's finances or save for their personal goals. For example, a student employed as a tutor can acquire teaching experience, while one working in retail can hone their customer service skills.However, it's vital that these jobs do not hinder their academic performance. Excessive work hours or overly demanding jobs can adversely affect their studies. Therefore, it’s essential for parents, schools, and employers to ensure that work commitments do not jeopardize educational priorities. In the end, having a job as a teenager can be a rewarding experience, provided it is balanced with academic responsibilities. By engaging in part-time work, teenagers can develop crucial life skills, enhance their character, and prepare for their future careers. In summary, working while studying can be beneficial, offering valuable experience and a sense of responsibility, as long as it doesn't interfere with their education.
40;Some schools send their students to institutions/organizations for a short to do some unpaid work. To what extent is it beneficial to the students and the organizations/institutions?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies, and then I would draw a conclusion at the end.To begin with, students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to. In most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom. As a result, students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation. For this reason, the internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy.As for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money. In addition, the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan. Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training. Therefore, companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation.To sum up, students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say.;The trend of placing students in institutions or organizations for brief periods of unpaid work has gained popularity in recent years. Known as work experience or internships, this practice aims to give students valuable hands-on experience and skills in a real-world environment. Ultimately, this approach benefits both the students and the organizations involved.For students, the advantages are diverse. Firstly, it allows them to apply theoretical knowledge in practical situations, which enhances their comprehension and retention of the material. Secondly, it introduces them to the professional world, helping them cultivate essential skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. These experiences are crucial for preparing students for their future careers and improving their competitiveness in the job market. Additionally, internships can sometimes lead to job offers, providing a direct pathway to employment after graduation.From the organization's standpoint, hosting students for unpaid roles can be equally advantageous. It brings in fresh perspectives and innovative ideas, as students often provide new approaches to various tasks. Furthermore, it serves as an effective recruitment strategy, enabling organizations to evaluate potential future hires without a long-term obligation. Organizations also gain extra support for projects and tasks, boosting productivity. Additionally, aiding in the education and development of upcoming professionals can enhance an organization’s corporate social responsibility profile, attracting more clients and top talent.However, it is important to acknowledge potential downsides, such as the risk of exploiting unpaid labor. Nevertheless, when structured appropriately, these work experiences can create a mutually beneficial scenario, offering students important practical knowledge while giving organizations insight into the future workforce and contributing to societal development. In summary, the practice of placing students in unpaid work positions is largely advantageous, delivering mutual benefits that can shape the next generation of professionals and support organizational growth.
41;Paying more money is the only possible motivation to make employees work harder and to increase their productivity. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this.A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places. Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile. For instance, junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want. If the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan.Nevertheless, I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances. Take Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce. By doing this, the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured.To sum up, I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees. Alternatively, providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses.;The idea that higher pay is the sole motivation for employees to enhance their performance and productivity remains a contentious issue. While financial incentives certainly play a crucial role in motivating workers, I believe they are not the only factor at play.On one side, offering increased salaries or bonuses can effectively drive motivation and output. Employees who see their efforts recognized and rewarded are more inclined to work harder and achieve top-notch results. Furthermore, attractive financial incentives can aid in securing and retaining the best talent amid fierce competition in the job market.Conversely, studies indicate that numerous other elements can inspire employees to elevate their productivity. Factors such as a sense of purpose, work-life balance, opportunities for training and growth, and a supportive, appreciative workplace environment also significantly contribute to motivation. Additionally, employees who find their work meaningful and feel they are part of a greater mission tend to be more driven and productive than those who are mainly incentivized by monetary rewards.In summary, while higher pay can motivate certain employees, it is not the exclusive motivator. Employers should consider a variety of factors to inspire their teams, including non-monetary benefits and fostering a positive work culture that emphasizes purpose and fulfillment. By adopting a more holistic approach to motivation, employers can cultivate a more engaged and productive workforce. Ultimately, a blend of both financial and non-financial incentives is likely to yield the best results in enhancing employee motivation and productivity.
42;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. Do you agree or disagree?;For most folks on Earth, the need to gather in one place, and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation. This trend is so deeply engraved in people's mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned, even when some participants are facing grievous social problems. It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation. This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace, and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols.Firstly, during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event. For example, when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers. This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality. Thus, world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace.Secondly, these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country. For instance, when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field. South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night. This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team. As a result, it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events.In conclusion, after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries, it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness. This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future.;"The claim that major events like the football World Cup and other international sports competitions play a crucial role in alleviating global tensions and allowing patriotic feelings to be expressed safely is a subject of discussion. While some believe these events foster unity and bring people together, I hold a nuanced view on the matter.On one side, international sporting events do create opportunities for nations to unite, potentially easing frictions and enhancing diplomatic relations. For example, the football World Cup gathers millions from diverse cultures, fostering a collective experience that goes beyond national divides. This shared passion can promote a sense of togetherness and recognition of our shared humanity, which may help mitigate tensions between countries.Conversely, such events can also spark conflicts and heighten feelings of nationalism, which may not always be channelled in a constructive or respectful way. The fierce competition often leads to intense rivalries, occasionally resulting in clashes among fans, and at times, even violence. Additionally, a strong focus on winning and national pride can foster an ""us versus them"" mentality, which might deepen existing divides rather than alleviate them.In summary, while international sporting events hold the promise of fostering unity and diminishing tensions, they do not inherently guarantee the safe expression of patriotic emotions. The overall impact hinges on various factors such as the competitive context, fan attitudes, and media portrayal. Thus, I believe these events can serve as a positive influence, but their effects should not be exaggerated, and proactive measures should be taken to ensure they promote harmony and respect instead of discord and division."
43;Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion.;The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past. It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly. I will analyze these areas in the essay.Firstly, the major source of energy today is water. Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source. To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India. If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity. Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.Secondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming. For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming. In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.To conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy. This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming. Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy.;The idea that governments ought to intensify their efforts to promote alternative energy sources has gained substantial momentum in recent years. I fully support this perspective, as the advantages of alternative energy are far superior to those of conventional fossil fuels.First and foremost, renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power are sustainable and environmentally friendly. In contrast, the combustion of fossil fuels is associated with climate change, air pollution, and various other environmental issues. By advocating for alternative energy, governments can help address these challenges and foster a cleaner, healthier environment for their citizens.Additionally, utilizing alternative energy can decrease a nation’s dependence on imported fuels, thereby enhancing energy security and mitigating the effects of price fluctuations. This shift can yield considerable economic benefits, alleviating financial pressure on households and businesses while generating new job opportunities within the renewable energy sector.Governments can encourage the adoption of alternative energy through various policies, including tax incentives, subsidies, and investments in renewable energy infrastructure. They can also promote energy efficiency through measures such as updated building codes and appliance standards. By taking a proactive stance in supporting alternative energy, governments can stimulate innovation, lower costs, and improve accessibility for households and businesses.In summary, I strongly believe that governments should increase their efforts to promote alternative energy sources. The benefits of these sources—including their reduced environmental impact, enhanced energy security, and economic advantages—make them a compelling choice for nations aiming to establish a sustainable energy future. By prioritizing alternative energy, governments can pave the way for a cleaner, more prosperous, and sustainable future for all citizens.
44;The government should aid unemployed people by direct financial help. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Unemployment is clearly a global problem, be it in developed countries or developing ones. However, I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out.Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only. Tax revenue is collected from those who works. Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers. Besides, there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, so addressing unemployment should have low priority.Also, it is obvious that, to survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well. If they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all.Of course, this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance. They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support. In this case, the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work. After all, it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again.In conclusion, my point of view is that, although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people, direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity.;The idea of providing direct financial assistance to people who are unemployed has ignited significant debate. I personally support this perspective. Offering financial support to those without jobs can significantly affect their lives and benefit the economy as a whole.To begin with, direct financial aid can be a crucial support system for individuals who have lost their jobs, enabling them to cover essential expenses and preserve their dignity. Unemployment often leads to financial hardship, stress, and anxiety. By providing direct financial assistance, the government can alleviate some of the burdens that come with job loss, allowing individuals to concentrate on securing new employment.Furthermore, direct financial support can positively impact the economy. Recipients of financial aid are more likely to spend their funds locally, thereby injecting cash into the economy and supporting small businesses. This can, in turn, foster economic growth and create additional job opportunities. Additionally, such support can help reduce the risks of poverty and homelessness, which can have lasting implications for both individuals and society.On the other hand, some may contend that direct financial aid can lead to a dependency mindset and deter individuals from seeking work. However, I assert that with the right measures and conditions in place—such as job training and educational programs—direct financial assistance can effectively support the unemployed and facilitate economic recovery. In summary, I strongly believe that the government should provide direct financial help to unemployed individuals, as it offers a necessary safety net, stimulates economic growth, and aids people in regaining their footing.
45;Some people think that universities should provide graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace. Others think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer. What, in your opinion, should be the main function of a university;Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise. Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts: where more and more is known about less and less. Nevertheless, among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life. However, although I respect the universities' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause, I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.A university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge. High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.On the other hand, universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather. It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed. So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.In conclusion, the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources. It would be helpful, however, if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures.;The role of universities has sparked considerable discussion in recent years. Some argue that their focus should primarily be on preparing students for the workforce, while others contend that the main objective should be to provide access to knowledge for its own sake. I believe that universities need to strike a balance between these two perspectives.On one side, it is crucial for universities to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary for the job market, as this aligns with employers’ expectations of graduates. This is especially vital in fields such as engineering, medicine, and law, where practical skills are indispensable. By offering relevant training and hands-on experience, universities can enhance students' employment prospects and enable them to make valuable contributions to the economy.Conversely, universities also have a responsibility to facilitate the pursuit of knowledge for its inherent value. This allows students to immerse themselves in diverse subjects without the immediate pressure of practical application. Such an approach nurtures critical thinking, creativity, and intellectual curiosity—qualities that are vital for personal development and societal advancement. Additionally, it empowers students to follow their passions and interests, even when those paths do not directly lead to employment.In conclusion, the primary function of a university should be to deliver a comprehensive education that integrates both practical skills and theoretical knowledge. This balanced approach not only prepares graduates for the workforce but also fosters intellectual curiosity and critical thinking. Ultimately, this will help students thrive in their careers while also making meaningful contributions to the advancement of knowledge and society.
46;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos. From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.To begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings. Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.Nevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside. They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting. However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat. It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression.;I disagree with the idea that zoos lack any useful purpose. While some may see them as purely entertainment, I believe they fulfill several important roles. Firstly, zoos are vital to conservation efforts. Many engage in breeding programs for endangered species, helping to boost their populations and mitigate the risk of extinction. A notable example is the California Condor breeding initiative at the San Diego Zoo, which has significantly aided in the species' recovery.In addition to conservation, zoos offer valuable educational experiences for the public. They provide a unique opportunity for visitors, especially children, to learn about and appreciate wildlife diversity. Observing animals in a controlled setting allows people to gain insight into their behaviors, habitats, and adaptations, which can foster empathy and inspire action to protect wildlife and their ecosystems.Moreover, zoos often facilitate scientific research, offering a platform for scientists to study aspects of animal behavior, physiology, and biology. This research can lead to significant advancements in fields such as veterinary medicine, ecology, and conservation biology. For instance, investigating animal behavior in zoo settings has enriched our knowledge of social dynamics, communication, and problem-solving in various species.In summary, zoos have a diverse array of purposes that go well beyond entertainment. They play a crucial role in conservation, education, and scientific research, establishing them as valuable institutions in today’s society. Far from lacking purpose, I firmly believe that zoos are essential for promoting wildlife well-being, preserving biodiversity, and raising public awareness about the importance of conservation and sustainability.
47;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees. From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions.To begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world. In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation. Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide. Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students. Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains.Nevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases. However, discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished.;The rise of distance-learning programs has transformed the educational landscape, providing greater flexibility and accessibility to a wider array of students. Nonetheless, the discussion about the effectiveness of these programs compared to traditional in-person college education remains ongoing. In my view, while distance-learning offers several benefits, I partially concur that it may not always match the effectiveness of face-to-face education in specific areas.On one hand, distance-learning programs deliver unmatched flexibility, enabling students to effectively manage their time and juggle academic pursuits alongside work or family responsibilities. This proves especially advantageous for those who cannot relocate due to personal or professional constraints. Furthermore, such programs typically offer a broader selection of courses and specializations than conventional institutions, catering to niche interests and giving students access to distinguished faculty from around the world.Conversely, I believe that in-person education provides unique advantages that distance-learning programs find challenging to replicate. The social engagement and human connections found in a traditional university environment are invaluable, fostering relationships, networking opportunities, and a sense of community that virtual settings often lack. Moreover, attending classes in person facilitates spontaneous discussions, debates, and inquiries that emerge during lectures, which can enhance comprehension and involvement with the subject matter.In summary, while distance-learning programs are undoubtedly a significant asset that enhances flexibility and accessibility, I agree that they may fall short of the holistic educational experience offered by in-person attendance. The advantages of social interaction, immediate feedback, and a structured learning environment render traditional university education distinctive and, in many cases, more effective. Nonetheless, distance-learning programs will continue to be an essential component in broadening educational access, and their importance should not be overlooked.
48;Some people have benefited from modern communication technology, but some people have not benefited from it at all. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones, e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication.To begin with, mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business. With the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds. Furthermore, it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world. With a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine. Therefore, it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind.Nevertheless, opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits. They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money. Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services. Consequently, people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies.By way of conclusion, I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases; however, the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn't afford it.";The emergence of modern communication technology has transformed how people connect and seek information. While many individuals have reaped significant rewards from these advancements, others have been excluded from the benefits. Personally, I partially agree that not everyone has gained from modern communication technology.On one side, these innovations have created countless opportunities for individuals to connect and access a wealth of information. For example, social media, messaging applications, and video conferencing tools allow people to maintain relationships with distant friends and family. Additionally, online educational resources and e-learning platforms enable individuals to learn new skills and acquire knowledge from their homes. Many, particularly those in urban settings with reliable internet access, have immensely benefited from these tools.Conversely, numerous individuals remain untouched by advances in communication technology. This is especially true for those in rural or underserved areas where internet connectivity is poor or absent. Moreover, older adults or individuals with limited tech skills may find it challenging to navigate these technologies, leading to feelings of isolation and disconnection. Furthermore, the digital divide has intensified existing social and economic disparities, leaving those without access to modern communication tools at a disadvantage in education, employment, and social engagement.In summary, while modern communication technology has undeniably enhanced the lives of many, it is equally accurate that some individuals have not shared in these benefits. It is crucial to address the digital divide and ensure equitable access to these technologies for all, regardless of geographic or socio-economic factors. Only then can we genuinely claim that modern communication technology has provided advantages for everyone.
49;Some people argue that musical lessons should be made mendatory in high school sducation while others argue that it's a wast of time for students. What is your opinion?;Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject, while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional. In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides.It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology. Therefore, many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music. I have an impression that students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time. In this case, music can be a useful and interesting solution. Moreover, if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life. In fact, students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music. Consequently, the calm atmosphere in the class might be created.By contrast, it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students. In our hectic life, however, demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees. Hence, I agree with the majority, because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it. Increasingly however, students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously. Therefore, music and other entertaining subjects should be optional. Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace. To my mind, students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song.In conclusion, I think that in order to be a competitive worker, students must know their field in an advanced level. On the other hand, music can help an individual to shape its character. An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory.;The discussion surrounding the necessity of mandatory music lessons in high school has ignited heated debate. While some view these lessons as a distraction for students, I strongly contend that they should be an essential component of high school education.To begin with, music lessons offer students a distinct chance to enhance their creative abilities and express themselves outside traditional academic frameworks. Research indicates that music positively influences cognitive growth, bolstering memory, spatial-temporal reasoning, and language skills. By integrating music into the school curriculum, students can enjoy these advantages, resulting in a more comprehensive educational experience.In addition, music education can significantly influence students' emotional and social growth. Mastering an instrument or participating in a choir can boost self-confidence, foster teamwork, and help manage stress and anxiety levels. Given the rising concerns about mental health among teenagers, it is crucial for schools to provide avenues for emotional expression and growth.Furthermore, music lessons allow students to connect with their cultural heritage and appreciate the rich variety of musical traditions from around the globe. This exposure can cultivate empathy, understanding, and respect for diverse cultures, which is vital in our interconnected world.In summary, requiring music lessons in high school education can greatly enrich students’ cognitive, emotional, and social development. Rather than being a waste of time, these lessons offer students a valuable and transformative experience that enhances their academic journey and equips them for success in various aspects of life.
50;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Universities should give the same amount of money to their students' sport activities as they give to their university libraries.;Libraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success. Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities. In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else.First, I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university. All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because, after internet, library plays an important role in research. Although sport is important, it does not have the same priority of library has. In addition only small part of students attend sport activities. For example, in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities.Second, usually libraries do not have income. Most libraries are free not for students also for public. Hence, universities support is vital for libraries. But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors. Also, they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets. To conclude, there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses, but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income.Last but not least, investing in libraries has a long-time result. For example, a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers. Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time. Besides, in the far future, they become more valuable. On the other side, most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time.In spite of the importance of sports activities, libraries are more important. They are critical part of universities and a good university has to have a modern library.;The idea that universities should invest equally in sports activities and their libraries is a contentious issue. While athletics contribute significantly to students' overall development, I disagree with this notion.University libraries serve as the cornerstone of academic life, offering students a wealth of resources, including books, journals, and online databases. These materials are crucial for conducting research and completing assignments. Furthermore, libraries provide a quiet atmosphere conducive to studying, which is essential for academic achievement. Adequate funding for libraries guarantees that students have access to the necessary tools for their educational success.In contrast, while sports are vital for students' physical and mental health, the expenses associated with sports facilities and equipment tend to be lower than those required for maintaining and updating library resources. Additionally, many universities offer scholarships and funding for talented athletes, which helps sustain their sports endeavors.Rather than equating the funding for sports and libraries, universities should consider allocating a sensible budget for athletic programs while prioritizing the library's needs. This balanced approach would ensure that students have the resources needed for academic success while also promoting their physical and mental well-being. In conclusion, although sports are valuable, I believe that universities should prioritize funding for their libraries to better support students' academic goals.
51;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;"With the development of globalization, English became the dominated language in national trade, conference and many important events. This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public.Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people. First of all, it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly. In the ancient time, the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas. Fortunately, the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers. If we can popularize the use of English, the language hinder will disappear as well. In addition, English is a beautiful language, which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages. Learning English can foster people's sentiment and nourish their literature and art.However, the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct. Even English is a sophisticated language; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries, which have totally different linguistic system. It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people's daily life, which is influenced by culture, environment as well as religious. Obviously, these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity.Personally, English as an elegant language should be advocated in many fields to expand the global trade and communications. But, we still need preserve other languages for sake of keeping the linguistic and cultural diversity.";The rise of English as a global language presents a complex situation, offering numerous advantages while simultaneously contributing to the erosion of less widely spoken languages. On one hand, the benefits of English's dominance are clear. It has enhanced international communication, facilitated commerce, and enabled cultural exchanges, effectively bridging geographical gaps and promoting global understanding. English has established itself as the common language of international business, science, and technology, allowing individuals from various linguistic backgrounds to interact and collaborate effortlessly.Conversely, the drawbacks of English's preeminence cannot be ignored. The growing prevalence of English has resulted in the decline of many lesser-known languages, as younger populations increasingly choose English as their main mode of communication. This trend carries significant cultural and social consequences, since languages are deeply intertwined with the histories, traditions, and identities of their communities. Therefore, the disappearance of a language is tantamount to a loss of cultural heritage and diversity.In summary, while the benefits of English's global dominance are substantial, I contend that the disadvantages are more profound. Preserving linguistic diversity is crucial for sustaining cultural richness and fostering global understanding. We must take steps to promote and protect lesser-known languages through educational programs and cultural initiatives. Ultimately, it is vital to find a balance between the advantages of a global language and the imperative to maintain linguistic diversity, ensuring that the benefits of English do not come at the cost of cultural heritage. Such efforts can lead to a more inclusive and diverse global community where every language is appreciated and respected.
52;Some people believe that humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit, while others argue that the rights of animals should be protected.;Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain. He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself. Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, while others are concerned that animals should not be misused. This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication.Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them. Likewise, other animals such as, horses, cattles and donkeys for farming, agriculture and as a mode of transportation. Many people keep pets like dogs and cats, trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples. They are kept for security purposes in houses.On the other hand, many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits. For instance, cows are often injected by Oxytocin, a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation. This in turn, causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle. Furthermore, thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products. Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights. Many other practices like, equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster. And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals.From my prospective, human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters. Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime.;The discussion surrounding the use of animals for human benefit versus their rights has persisted for many years. On one side, some advocate for the utilitarian view that animals can be harnessed to enhance human life, offering critical resources such as food, clothing, and companionship. For example, livestock like cows and chickens are cultivated for their meat, dairy, and eggs, which play vital roles in human nutrition. Furthermore, domesticated animals, including horses and dogs, are trained to support humans in various functions like transportation and search-and-rescue operations.Conversely, others contend that animals possess inherent rights that warrant protection. They argue that, being sentient beings capable of experiencing pain, joy, and suffering, animals deserve to be treated with kindness and respect, rather than being exploited for human purposes. Numerous animal welfare organizations and advocates assert that using animals for food, entertainment, or scientific research is unethical and should be abolished. They suggest alternatives such as plant-based diets, synthetic materials, and advanced technologies to replace animal-derived products and services.In conclusion, while some maintain that animals can be utilized for human advantage, others firmly believe in the necessity of protecting their rights. It is essential to find a middle ground that addresses human needs while ensuring animal welfare is upheld. This can be accomplished through responsible, sustainable animal husbandry practices and the promotion of alternatives that limit animal exploitation. Ultimately, recognizing the intrinsic value of animals and treating them with the respect and compassion they deserve will foster a more ethical and harmonious coexistence between humans and animals.
53;Modern technology has made it possible for people to view exhibitions at home so museums and art galleries will disappear soon. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology; therefore, some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon. Although modern technology make it possible, I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear.On the one hand, technology indeed simplifies people's life all the time. Obviously, people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home, save the time and money on the road, which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society. However, in accordance with recent research, experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication.On the other hand, the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture. First of all, authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos. It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos, so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it. Furthermore, museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages; therefore, these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture.In conclusion, I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions, but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture.";The emergence of modern technology has transformed our interactions with art and exhibitions. Virtual tours, online displays, and high-definition digital presentations have made it possible for individuals to appreciate artworks from the comfort of their own homes. However, I contend that this development will not render museums and art galleries obsolete.Although technology allows for remote access to exhibitions, it cannot duplicate the authentic and immersive experience that physical museums and galleries offer. The tactile quality of art, along with the opportunity to appreciate the texture, scale, and intricate details of a piece up close, is irreplaceable in a virtual environment. Additionally, museums and galleries foster a social and cultural atmosphere, bringing people together to engage in discussions and deepen their understanding of art. The unique ambiance of these institutions is a fundamental aspect of the art-viewing experience that cannot be matched online.Moreover, museums and galleries have a critical function in the preservation and conservation of artworks, in addition to providing educational programs and workshops. These institutions employ dedicated curators, conservators, and educators who are committed to promoting art, history, and culture. The absence of museums and galleries would represent a significant loss, not only for art enthusiasts but also for the broader community.In summary, while modern technology undoubtedly enhances our access to art and exhibitions, I am confident that museums and art galleries will continue to flourish. They provide a singular and enriching experience that virtual tours and online exhibitions cannot replicate. Instead, technology is likely to complement and elevate the museum and gallery experience, enabling people to engage with art in fresh and innovative ways.
54;Some people believe that teenagers should learn all school subjects, while others claim that students should focus on the subjects that they are best at or that they are interested in. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Presently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected. Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study. Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.It is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future. Therefore, I do support the view of learning all school subjects.;The discussion over how students should approach learning school subjects has generated significant dialogue among both educators and students. Some contend that teenagers should engage with all subjects, arguing that a comprehensive education exposes them to diverse fields and promotes a well-rounded knowledge base. This broad exposure not only enhances critical thinking skills but also empowers students to make informed decisions. Additionally, it allows them to uncover hidden talents and interests that might not emerge otherwise.Conversely, others advocate for a focus on subjects more aligned with students' strengths or interests. This strategy encourages specialization in areas where they naturally excel, fostering a deeper understanding of those subjects. By honing in on their passions, students can develop a clearer sense of purpose and direction, which can boost motivation and lead to greater academic success.In my view, a balanced approach that integrates aspects of both perspectives is most effective. While it is crucial to provide a solid foundation in various subjects, it is equally important to allow students the opportunity to specialize and dive deeper into their interests. This strategy not only ensures a comprehensive education in core subjects but also promotes engagement and fulfillment. Ultimately, adopting a flexible, student-centered approach to learning will empower teenagers to realize their full potential and equip them for an evolving, complex world.
55;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;In the present age, it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English. Some people claim it's a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits. Personally, I agree with the former opinion.No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally. To begin with, communication between countries and cultures become convenient. In my country, English is a required course from elementary school. Thus, studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters. For them, language obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country. This, in turn, enhances relationship and promotes international business. Furthermore, researchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English. Taking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English. It's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides. As a result, they have no choice but choosing English as a second language.Admittedly, opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year. Hence, the culture heritage and nation identity vanish. However, this is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society.In conclusion, in spite of some negative effects, I'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around. I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization. But at the same time, actions, like recording, can be taken to protect native languages and cultures.;The rising prominence of the English language has sparked considerable debate in recent years, with many asserting that it is contributing to the decline of lesser-known languages. While both sides present valid arguments, I believe that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its benefits.On one side, the proliferation of English brings undeniable advantages. It has emerged as a global lingua franca, promoting communication and economic interaction among countries. This facilitates opportunities in international trade, education, and cultural exchange. Additionally, proficiency in English has become a valuable asset, allowing individuals to access a wealth of information and engage with diverse communities.Conversely, the encroachment of English on lesser-known languages poses serious consequences. The decline of linguistic diversity is a pressing issue, as languages are often intricately linked to cultural identity and heritage. As English gains dominance, many indigenous languages face the threat of extinction, along with the histories, traditions, and customs of the communities that speak them. This shift not only leads to cultural homogenization but also diminishes unique perspectives and modes of thought.In summary, while the benefits of the widespread use of English are clear, I contend that its negative effects are more significant. The erosion of linguistic diversity and cultural heritage represents a serious loss that must not be overlooked. We must strive to promote and safeguard lesser-known languages to help them flourish in an increasingly globalized world. Initiatives such as language education programs, cultural exchanges, and community-driven preservation efforts can play a crucial role. Ultimately, finding a balance between the advantages of a global language and the need for linguistic diversity is essential.
56;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, pictures, music or film) in whichever way they wish. there should be no government restrictions on what they do. to what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious. Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds. Creativity originates in a free mind. Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions.Time and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message. Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras. Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message.Nonetheless, innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience. It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments. For instance, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue. This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds. In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.Unfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, ""Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open“. Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains. Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely.However, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people. Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose. I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression. Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries. Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws.";The debate surrounding the idea that creative artists should have complete freedom to express their ideas is a complex one. While I believe that artistic expression is crucial for fostering innovation and progress, the notion of having no government restrictions at all is an oversimplification.On one hand, granting artists total freedom can result in the creation of bold and thought-provoking works that challenge societal norms and ignite significant conversations. When artistic expression is free from constraints, it can nurture a culture of creativity and experimentation, ultimately contributing to social and cultural advancement. Additionally, censorship can hinder innovation and restrict artists from exploring new frontiers and ideas.Conversely, removing all government regulations can lead to concerning outcomes. For example, completely unrestricted artistic expression might give rise to hate speech, graphic violence, and other harmful content, which could adversely affect individuals and society as a whole. Moreover, certain types of artistic expression may violate the rights of others, including privacy and copyright protections. As such, some degree of regulation is essential for safeguarding the rights and well-being of all members of society.In summary, I advocate for significant freedom for creative artists to express their ideas, but I contend that some level of government oversight is necessary. Striking a balance between artistic freedom and social responsibility is vital to ensure that artistic expression is upheld while also protecting the rights and welfare of others. By establishing reasonable and thoughtful regulations, governments can encourage a culture of creativity and innovation without compromising the greater good.
57;some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;The modern society is full of cut-throat competition. Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed. However, co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle.Co-operation is essential for teamwork. Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children. We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success. A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself. For instance, lions hunt in a team. It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy. In the same way, co-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate.Nevertheless, co-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes. It helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others. A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements. However, competition is also as important as co-operation.Unfortunately, the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction. An individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others. Competition has helped the development of science and technology. Competition helps in improvement and evolution. For example, every other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others. This kind of competition gives customers more options.However, blind and selfish competition is detrimental. 'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run. Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule. A healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach.Thus, competition and co-operation go hand in hand. These are two sides of the same coin which can't be separated. I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition. They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition. When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together, success, achievements, recognition and any goal becomes easier.;The discussion regarding whether to encourage competition or cooperation among children has led to a lively debate among educators and parents. Proponents of competition argue that it is crucial for kids' development, asserting that it inspires them to pursue excellence and work harder toward their goals. This mindset cultivates important traits like resilience, discipline, and determination. Additionally, competition prepares children for the challenges and setbacks they will face as adults.Conversely, some advocates believe that promoting cooperation is more advantageous for children. They contend that working collaboratively fosters teamwork, empathy, and mutual respect—qualities essential for building robust relationships and achieving collective success. By striving toward shared objectives, children learn to recognize each other's strengths and weaknesses, as well as important social skills such as communication, active listening, and conflict resolution. Furthermore, cooperation contributes to developing a sense of community and social responsibility, which are critical for a harmonious and productive society.In my view, striking a balance between competition and cooperation is the most effective strategy. While competition can encourage children to reach their personal best, an overemphasis on winning can lead to an unhealthy fixation on individual success. On the other hand, cooperation nurtures a sense of unity and shared purpose but may lack the drive necessary for pushing children beyond their limits. Ultimately, an integrated approach that combines both competition and cooperation can help children grow into well-rounded, motivated, and socially responsible individuals, equipped to thrive in various aspects of life.
58;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violent increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Crime is always punishable. Retribution is the method for countering criminals. Some countries have stringent rules, like capital punishment, while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system. However, strict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society.Capital punishment is given only in the ""rarest of the rare"" cases. Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings. When a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment. Thus, capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals.Moreover, capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes. When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes. Thus, the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased.Importantly, capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals. Criminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment.However, the jury giving the verdict are also humans. They have the life of a person at their discretion. They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. For example, if an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous. Only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment.Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society. I firmly believe that psychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment. Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner. However, it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict.";"The assertion that our lives are less secure and that violent crime rises in the absence of capital punishment is a controversial topic. While some contend that capital punishment is crucial for curbing violence in society, others argue that it does not effectively deter crime. I partially disagree with this statement.On one hand, capital punishment may act as a deterrent for potential offenders; the fear of execution can dissuade some individuals from committing acts of violence. Additionally, it can offer a sense of justice and closure for the families of victims. For example, countries like Singapore, which maintain strict laws including capital punishment, boast low crime rates, citing these laws as a contributing factor.Conversely, there are numerous arguments against this viewpoint. First, capital punishment may not effectively deter crime, as many offenses occur impulsively or under the influence of substances, where the perpetrator is not considering the repercussions. Moreover, there is an inherent risk of wrongfully executing an innocent person, a tragic error that cannot be corrected. Furthermore, research indicates that rates of violent crime are more significantly influenced by social and economic conditions—such as poverty, unemployment, and lack of education—than by the presence or absence of capital punishment.In conclusion, while capital punishment can provide certain benefits, such as delivering justice and closure for victims' families, it is not the most effective means of controlling violence within society. Addressing social and economic challenges and enhancing the justice system are more critical in reducing crime rates. Therefore, I assert that our lives are not necessarily less secure without capital punishment and that its efficacy in curbing violence is limited."
59;In some countries, young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Studies are an essential part of life. Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies, while in some countries, it is considered as waste of time. However, a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school.In most education systems, a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age. A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change. A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions. Personally, a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by traveling or following their hobbies. Importantly, when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge.Nevertheless, during high school, many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in. Working or traveling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest. It will also help them to learn professional setup by working. Financially, students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job. Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course.However, there are also disadvantages. A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental. When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia. For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably. Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time. But, the break should be an optional thing. It varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period. A break gives students more benefits than harms.Importantly, the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them. Thus, a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies. Countries, like India, where such a break is considered a blot, should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition. One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life.;The gap year, a time frame between finishing high school and beginning university studies, has become a popular choice for many young people in various countries. During this year, many opt to travel or work, each having its own set of pros and cons.On one hand, a gap year can be extremely advantageous for young individuals. It offers them a chance to acquire valuable work experience, develop new skills, and foster independence. Many students take this opportunity to travel, immerse themselves in different cultures, and expand their horizons, which can be profoundly rewarding. Furthermore, a gap year can serve as a much-needed respite from the pressures of academic life, allowing students to rest and recalibrate before entering university.Conversely, there are potential downsides to consider. A primary concern is that a gap year may interrupt a student’s academic trajectory. After a year away from studying, some students might find it challenging to readjust to academic routines, which can affect their performance in university. Additionally, some may view the gap year as a chance to procrastinate and become unmotivated, jeopardizing their pursuit of higher education altogether.In conclusion, embarking on a gap year presents both opportunities and challenges for young people. While it can facilitate the acquisition of work experience and promote personal growth, it can also disrupt academic progress and dampen motivation. Ultimately, the decision to take a gap year is a personal choice that hinges on an individual’s aspirations, priorities, and unique circumstances. With thoughtful planning and a clear objective, a gap year can serve as a truly rewarding and enriching experience.
60;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;"Computer-a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life. Ever since Charles Babbage (know as ""Father of computers"") invented computers, its development never had a pause. The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years.In the modern world, computers are used everywhere. Right from flying planes to sending a small document, computers are needed. They are used in space programs, wars, hospitals, schools and so on. Computers have made human life more easy, convenient and lightning fast. For example, in earlier days, if one had to send a message to someone in other country, it used to take months. But today, it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks. Computers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it.Moreover, future prospects of computers are very bright. From a computer as big as a room, it has now been minimized to the size of a palm. Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels. Research on making computerized drone soldiers (unmanned computer controlled) is going on. There is no end to the evolution of computers.However, everything has pros and cons. Computers have made humans over-dependent. Virus programs, privacy breach, leak of confidential documents, cyber attacks, identity theft, frauds etc. are some of its demerits, from a countless list. Computers expose children to vulgar materials. They have even invaded mental health of humans, for example, FAD (Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook). Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives. The recent case of Wikileaks, leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful.Nevertheless, with all the mentioned demerits, computers have provided security and sophistication too. Thus, dependence on computers is not a bad thing. However, one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things. Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective. Human life today can't be imagined without computers, so not depending on them is out of question.";The world is undergoing a significant transformation characterized by an increasing dependence on computers, with their applications expanding across various domains including business, healthcare, crime detection, and aviation. As technology progresses, it is clear that computers will become even more central to our everyday existence. In the future, we can anticipate their use in innovative areas such as education, where learning experiences will be customized to meet each student’s unique needs. They will also play a crucial role in environmental monitoring, helping to predict and alleviate the impacts of climate change. Additionally, computers are set to further revolutionize the medical field, enabling accurate diagnoses and targeted treatments, potentially leading to groundbreaking advancements in disease prevention and treatment.Nevertheless, this growing reliance on computers prompts important considerations regarding its implications. On one side, the benefits of computer technology are significant. They enhance efficiency, precision, and speed across numerous sectors, propelling societal advancement. Moreover, computers have paved the way for improved communication, connectivity, and access to information, fostering a more interconnected and informed global community.Conversely, concerns arise regarding the dangers of excessive dependence on technology. Relying too heavily on computers may lead to a decline in fundamental skills and critical thinking. Additionally, threats such as cyberattacks, data breaches, and technological failures present serious risks to privacy, security, and infrastructure. Therefore, while it is essential to embrace the advancements and benefits brought by computers, maintaining a balanced perspective is crucial. This entails investing in cybersecurity, promoting digital literacy, and ensuring that traditional skills and knowledge are not neglected in our rush to adopt new technologies. By recognizing both the advantages and potential drawbacks, we can leverage the power of computers to enhance our world while steering clear of the dangers of over-dependence.
61;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Education is important for the development of the world. Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not. However, since both genders are equally important, both must be given equal opportunities. Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices.Right to education is a basic human right of both, males and females. The whole world aims for women empowerment, and to achieve this, females should be given equal opportunities as males. When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop.Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other. It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together. For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them. On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys. Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both. Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run.Unfortunately, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc. This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society. Time and again, women have proved their mettle in every field. Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills.Thus, I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers. Equality in education will help in development of the society. Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior. Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit, irrespective of the gender. Educational rights must be given to both genders.;The notion that universities should enroll equal numbers of male and female students across all disciplines has ignited intense discussion. While some contend that this strategy advances gender equality, I hold a partially opposing view.On one hand, achieving equal representation of both genders in every field could help address disparities in areas where one gender is notably underrepresented. For instance, women frequently face a significant imbalance in STEM fields, and implementing such policies might encourage greater female participation in these careers. Additionally, this strategy can contribute to a richer and more inclusive educational environment, benefiting all students involved.Conversely, instituting rigid quotas may present challenges. This system could result in less qualified candidates being admitted over more suitable ones solely to satisfy gender equity goals, potentially undermining the academic standards of the institution and disadvantaging students who are better suited for specific programs. Moreover, some fields naturally attract more students of one gender, and attempting to enforce an artificial balance could prove counterproductive.In summary, while advancing gender equality in higher education is crucial, I believe a more nuanced strategy is required. Instead of mandating equal enrollment figures for male and female students in every discipline, universities should strive to cultivate an environment that motivates and supports individuals of all genders to pursue their academic passions. Such efforts could include focused outreach initiatives, scholarships, and mentoring programs aimed at attracting and retaining underrepresented demographics. By embracing a more comprehensive approach, universities can foster diversity and inclusion without compromising academic excellence.
62;Do you agree or disagree with the statement: people will spend less time on cooking food;Perhaps, no issue in this world is as significant to people as cooking food, because it affects everybody in their daily lives. Some people hold the opinion that people should spend much time on food. However, I do think that people are likely to spend less time in cooking food. There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint, and among those reasons are two important ones.The first and foremost reason is that with the development of science and technology, more advanced kitchen facilities, such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers, have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time. As a result, people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two, even three hours like in the last 10 years. Actually, in recent years, there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework. And this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology. Thus, it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future.Another reason is that most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants because they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves. According to a recent survey, 89% of people have come to think that, since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures, they have to use a lot of time to work hard, to update themselves, to acquire all kinds of skills and so on. Thus, they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal. Even they have some spare time, they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study.Some people may argue that investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family. To some extent, it is true. However, as a matter of fact, using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality. Even, with the help of ozone machines, bacterias, mold spores, or pesticide in vegetables, fruits and foods will be killed and removed, thus health and life of eaters is assured. Besides, along with the high living standard, requirements of quality products in almost restaurants, nowadays, are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities. Consequently, it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality, but do not waste a lot of time.To sum up, if all those factors are contemplated, it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint. So, from what have been discussed above, I strongly affirm the conclusion that people will spend less time in cooking food.;The idea that people are spending less time cooking has gained considerable attention lately. With modern technology and the demands of a fast-paced lifestyle, it's reasonable to believe that individuals are dedicating less time to meal preparation. I support this viewpoint for several reasons.Firstly, the emergence of convenience foods and meal delivery services has transformed how people eat. These options provide a variety of meals that can be assembled and delivered much more quickly than preparing a dish from scratch. Consequently, many people, particularly those with busy lives, are choosing these faster alternatives, leading to reduced time in the kitchen.In addition, advancements in kitchen technology have significantly contributed to shortened cooking times. Devices like microwaves, instant pots, and air fryers allow for quick meal preparation, enabling individuals to create dishes in just minutes. This ease of cooking, combined with the increasing availability of pre-cut and pre-cooked ingredients, further accelerates the cooking process.Finally, a societal shift towards busier lifestyles and a focus on leisure activities reinforces the notion that cooking time will continue to shrink. As people prioritize career advancement, fitness, and social engagements, the time spent on cooking is likely to diminish.In summary, taking into account the influences of convenience, technological progress, and evolving lifestyles, it is logical to agree that people will indeed spend less time preparing meals. As society continues to evolve and life becomes increasingly hurried, the trend toward quicker and more convenient food options is expected to grow.
63;Traditional games are more useful than modern games in developing children's skills. To what extent do you agree?;Games have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities. With technological advances, children have more access to modern games currently. In such case, the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children's developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion. For me, I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.It is true that modern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend. This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future. At the same time, children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative.However, I think traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society. One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills. Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face. As a result, communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more.Furthermore, it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today. In fact, these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices. By contrast, modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits. Therefore, there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival.Thus, I would conclude that traditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games. Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process.;The ongoing debate about the advantages of traditional games compared to modern games in nurturing children's skills has generated significant discussion. While some contend that modern games hold the upper hand, I strongly believe that traditional games are more effective in cultivating essential skills in children.Games like hide and seek, tag, and board games provide distinct advantages that are often unmatched by modern alternatives. For example, they encourage physical activity, foster social interaction, and stimulate cognitive growth. Outdoor activities such as tag and hide and seek promote exercise, enhance motor skills, and teach teamwork and strategy. Meanwhile, board games like chess and checkers develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and spatial awareness.In contrast, modern games, while entertaining and engaging, frequently fall short in depth and richness compared to traditional games. Many modern games are geared towards solo play, which limits social engagement and collaborative skills. Additionally, the heavy reliance on technology can contribute to a sedentary lifestyle, leading to various health issues. While some modern games do offer educational elements, they typically lack the hands-on and immersive experience that traditional games provide.Furthermore, traditional games are generally more accessible and economical than modern ones, which often require costly hardware and software. This inclusivity allows children from diverse backgrounds to participate and hone their essential skills. In summary, despite the merits of modern games, I believe that traditional games are far superior in skill development for children. They deliver a unique blend of physical, social, and cognitive benefits vital for a child's overall growth. Therefore, parents and educators should prioritize traditional games to help children evolve into well-rounded and capable individuals.
64;Some people said the government shouldn't put money on building theaters or sports stadiums but should spend more money on medical care and education. Do you agree or disagree?;How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public. Recently, some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities. As far as I am concerned, this proposal is beneficial more to the society.Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums. As a matter of fact, an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games. Therefore, providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government.Entertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented. Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience. The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government. Instead, the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government.Furthermore, putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them. For example, not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot. Therefore, it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs. That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.To summarize, I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, because the former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens.;The distribution of government funds is a debated topic, with many advocating for a focus on crucial services like healthcare and education rather than investments in theaters or sports stadiums. I support this viewpoint, as prioritizing healthcare and education leads to long-term advantages for both the nation and its citizens.First and foremost, healthcare and education are basic human rights that necessitate significant funding to guarantee fair access for all. Insufficient investment in these areas can result in dire outcomes, including deteriorating public health and a shortage of skilled workers. By emphasizing medical care, governments can enhance healthcare facilities, hire more healthcare professionals, and offer quality services to the populace. Similarly, funding education facilitates the cultivation of an informed and skilled workforce, which is vital for a country’s economic development and societal advancement.Conversely, although theaters and sports stadiums can enhance the cultural and recreational landscape of a community, they are not as essential as healthcare and education. These venues can be financed and maintained through private investments or public-private partnerships, alleviating financial pressure on the government. Additionally, the advantages of theaters and sports facilities, such as encouraging arts and physical fitness, can also be realized through alternative and more budget-friendly options like community centers and public parks.In summary, considering the critical roles that healthcare and education play in the welfare and progress of a nation, I strongly believe that government spending should prioritize these sectors over the construction of theaters or sports stadiums. This strategic allocation of resources will have a more profound and enduring effect on citizens' quality of life and future opportunities.
65;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It's pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Living in the 21st century, people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity. Thus, every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years, regardless of any potential problems it may bring about. Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles. However, I believe their concern is groundless. Instead, technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles.In terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life. In the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles. This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills. However, with the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere.Additionally, technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing. For example, China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens. In fact, many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture.On the other hand, some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles. They argue that people, especially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques. But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years.Therefore, I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles. Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run.;The idea that traditional skills and lifestyles fall by the wayside due to technological innovation has ignited considerable discussion. While some believe it's pointless to uphold these outdated practices, I only partially share that viewpoint.On one side, technological advancements have certainly contributed to the decline of specific traditional skills. For example, the widespread use of calculators and computers has reduced the necessity for manual arithmetic and mental math. Similarly, automation has taken over many manual labor positions, making traditional craftsmanship less significant. In these instances, it may appear unproductive to attempt to preserve such outmoded practices.Conversely, numerous traditional skills and lifestyles continue to possess considerable cultural, aesthetic, and educational importance. Traditional crafts like pottery, weaving, and woodworking not only foster a sense of community and identity but also help preserve cultural heritage. Additionally, these skills often demand creativity, problem-solving, and attention to detail—qualities that are crucial for personal growth and development. Furthermore, many traditional methods, such as organic farming and natural healing, present viable alternatives to modern industrial practices and can promote a more sustainable and environmentally friendly way of living.In summary, while it’s true that some traditional skills may become obsolete due to technological progress, it is not entirely futile to strive to keep them alive. Efforts to preserve and promote traditional practices support cultural diversity, provide a connection to the past, and offer distinct advantages that modern technology cannot replicate. Thus, a balanced approach that recognizes the merits of technological advances while also valuing traditional skills and ways of life is vital for holistic and sustainable development.
66;Creative artists should be given freedom to express their ideas (words, pictures, music and films. However some people think government should take some restriction with them. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life; however, some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government. It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society; however, I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work. It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning. If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth? In a word, the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified.Let's then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals. It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc. I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.By way of conclusion, I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work; on the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful.";"The ongoing discourse about the freedom of creative artists to convey their ideas has ignited vigorous discussions in recent years. While some contend that artists should enjoy unrestricted freedom of expression, others advocate for certain constraints imposed by governments. I believe that while artists should have considerable freedom to express their thoughts, this freedom should not be absolute.On one hand, allowing artists to freely express their ideas can result in groundbreaking and thought-provoking works that challenge societal conventions and push limits. Such freedom enables artists to share their unique viewpoints and visions, potentially giving rise to novel ideas and cultural movements. For example, films like ""Schindler's List"" and ""Hotel Rwanda"" have highlighted historical injustices and instigated significant dialogues regarding human rights.Conversely, some argue that governments should establish constraints to curb the dissemination of hate speech, obscenity, and other detrimental content. I concur that certain restrictions are essential for safeguarding vulnerable individuals in society.In summary, while I advocate for granting creative artists a considerable degree of freedom to express their thoughts, this freedom must come with limitations. Governments should implement specific restrictions to prevent harm and ensure that artistic expression does not undermine the well-being of others. Striking a balance between artistic freedom and social responsibility is vital for nurturing a healthy and dynamic cultural environment. This approach will allow creativity and innovation to flourish while also upholding the rights and dignity of all individuals."
67;The government should control the amount of violence in the media to reduce the number of violent crimes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media.Obviously, violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences. This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who, lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong, are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable.On the other hand, media, such as TV or film, is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government. It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society. Violence, as one of the facts in the real world, certainly has to be reported. However, excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well. It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members, one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy. In the real world, we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure.We cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present. What the government should do immediately is to strengthen censorship to control the amount of violence in media. Otherwise, the violent crime rate will rise continuously and out of control someday.;The question of whether the government should regulate the portrayal of violence in media to reduce violent crime has ignited considerable debate. Some believe that such regulation is essential for curbing aggressive behavior, while others argue it compromises freedom of expression. I hold a partial agreement with the notion of government intervention, but I believe it should be carefully balanced with the need to uphold artistic freedom.On one hand, it is logical to assume that exposure to violent media can lead to increased aggression, especially among children and teenagers. Research suggests that sustained exposure to violent content may desensitize individuals to the repercussions of violence, potentially resulting in a rise in violent acts. Therefore, implementing governmental regulations could be beneficial in reducing this risk by restricting the depiction of violence in media, particularly in content designed for younger viewers.Conversely, imposing heavy regulations on media content can raise significant concerns regarding censorship and the suppression of creative expression. The media serves an important function in reflecting and critiquing societal issues, including those related to violence. Strikingly strict regulations may hinder filmmakers, writers, and artists from exploring these intricate themes in a meaningful and authentic way. Furthermore, in a democratic society, the rights to free speech and expression should remain robust and not be excessively limited.In conclusion, while I recognize the potential advantages of government regulation in the fight against violent crime, I believe that such measures must be implemented with caution to prevent unjust censorship. A balanced strategy that safeguards vulnerable audiences while maintaining artistic freedom is crucial. Ultimately, fostering education and critical thinking skills is equally important in helping individuals differentiate between fictional violence and real-life repercussions, thus cultivating a more responsible and compassionate society.
68;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think this situation has caused more problems than it has solved. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons or your answer;"The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life, including the revolution of feminism. Women have been opened up to more chances than ever. This, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society from my point of view.To start with, the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society. Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children. Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on. This is to say, the ""weaker"" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields.In the second place, the revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well. The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money. What is more, women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration.Admittedly, such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or, under many circumstances, women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives. Also, children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work. Yet everything has it upside and downside, women should find the best way to overcome such challenges.All things considered, in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles.";The belief that the rise in opportunities for women in contemporary society has resulted in more challenges than benefits is a subject of debate. While some may contend that this change has caused numerous difficulties, I strongly disagree with this viewpoint.In fact, I maintain that the expanding opportunities for women represent a crucial advancement towards equality and social improvement. A major benefit of this phenomenon is the empowerment of women, allowing them to make informed choices regarding their lives, careers, and families. With enhanced access to education and employment, women can now contribute economically, support their families, and pursue their interests. This shift has fostered a more diverse and skilled workforce, spurring innovation and economic growth.Furthermore, the increasing involvement of women across different sectors has dismantled traditional stereotypes and challenged patriarchal norms. Women are now seen in leadership roles, politics, and other fields that were once male-dominated. This progress not only inspires future generations of women but also promotes a more inclusive and equitable society. Moreover, as more women enter the workforce, men are increasingly sharing domestic responsibilities, leading to a healthier work-life balance and more stable families.In summary, the enhancement of opportunities for women has undoubtedly addressed more issues than it has created. By empowering women and advancing equality, we have made significant progress in building a more just and prosperous society. While there are still challenges to address, the advantages of women’s empowerment greatly outweigh the disadvantages, and we should continue striving for a future where women have equal access to opportunities and resources.
69;Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree? What other measures do you think might be effective?;"As we read newspapers or watch TV, we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues, air and water pollution questions. Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems. As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching, it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems, though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society.Specifically, price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area; however, whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated. On one hand, governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands. Consequently, it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly. On the other hand, pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution. In addition, the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours.As illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems. Primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars. Furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season. Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems. Meanwhile, cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice.In conclusion, addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate, while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable, plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised.";The idea that raising petrol prices is the best solution to escalating traffic and pollution challenges is a debate fraught with differing opinions. While I recognize the logic behind this strategy, my agreement is only partial. On one hand, higher petrol prices can undoubtedly decrease the number of cars on the road, making driving a more costly endeavor. This reduction in vehicle numbers can alleviate congestion and, as a result, reduce emissions that contribute to pollution. Furthermore, elevated petrol costs can motivate people to explore alternative modes of transportation, such as cycling or using public transit.Conversely, relying solely on price increases may not be the most effective or fair approach. For example, low-income families who depend on their cars for daily travel may face significant challenges, leading to financial strain. Additionally, raising petrol prices does not confront the underlying issues of traffic congestion, such as suboptimal urban planning, inadequate public transportation options, and the overall volume of vehicles in circulation.More effective solutions could include investing in public transportation to enhance its efficiency, reliability, and accessibility. Encouraging carpooling and applying congestion pricing in busy areas can also help reduce unnecessary driving during peak times. Additionally, promoting the adoption of electric or hybrid vehicles through subsidies or tax incentives can directly cut down on pollution without imposing excessive burdens on low-income households. Implementing urban planning initiatives that prioritize pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure could further encourage a shift away from reliance on private vehicles. In summary, while increasing petrol prices may offer some advantages, a comprehensive strategy that encompasses enhancing public transport, promoting carpooling, and incentivizing eco-friendly vehicles would likely be a more effective and equitable means of addressing traffic and pollution challenges.
70;Should advertisements be banned? To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information. Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public. My view is that while some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring.First, it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring. In fact, they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor.Besides, it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies. In a larger sense, it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country. A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic.That is not to say, however, that advertisements have no downsides. Of course, the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies. Yet, its merits still outweigh these downsides.Taken all together, advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth. We can not deny all of them. However, if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned, advertisements would be welcomed by more.;The debate over whether to ban advertisements has intensified in recent years. Some advocate for advertising as an essential component of a free market economy, while others argue that it can be manipulative and misleading. Personally, I believe that advertisements should be restricted, but only to a degree.On one hand, advertisements are vital for informing consumers about new products and services and assisting businesses in reaching their target markets. They contribute to economic growth by creating jobs and stimulating the economy. Additionally, advertisements can be both entertaining and informative, equipping consumers with knowledge to make better purchasing decisions.Conversely, many advertisements can be deceptive, making false claims regarding their products or services. They often intrude on our media consumption by interrupting shows and cluttering public spaces. Furthermore, advertisements can negatively influence children by promoting unhealthy foods and behaviors. In these instances, I believe it is essential to implement regulations and ban those advertisements that are misleading or harmful.In summary, I do not support an outright ban on all advertisements, but I do advocate for stricter regulations within the advertising industry to guard against misleading and deceptive practices. While advertisements can serve as valuable tools for both businesses and consumers, it is crucial that they are executed with responsibility and integrity. By imposing regulations and prohibiting harmful ads, we can foster a more transparent and honest market, ultimately protecting consumers from exploitation. A balanced approach to advertising is essential to reap its benefits while minimizing its drawbacks.
71;People have different ways of escaping the stress and difficulties of modern life. Some read, some exercise, others work in their gardens. What do you think are the best ways of reducing stress? Use specific details and examples to support your opinion.;In modern society, people often face many difficulties under great stress. Therefore, it is necessary for many to find ways to relax. Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies, such as reading, watching movies, or working in their gardens, I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise, which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions.It is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health. Any kinds of sports, such as jogging, swimming, or playing basketball, can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system. Moreover, these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body. The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity. Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years, which mainly results from insufficient exercises.Sports activities can improve mental health as well. When people exercise, the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine. This hormone can delight one's mind, creating positive feelings. Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one's heavy burdens. Moreover, rigorous exercise can also hone one's will, which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks.In a nutshell, many activities can let humans relax. Nevertheless, I assert that the best way of diminishing stress is by exercises, which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally.;"Modern life can often feel overwhelming, making it crucial to discover effective ways to manage stress. People have diverse preferences for stress relief, but I believe the most successful strategies incorporate a mix of physical activity, mental tranquility, and creative expression.One of the most effective methods for alleviating stress is exercise, which stimulates the release of endorphins, commonly referred to as ""feel-good"" hormones. This natural boost helps to reduce anxiety and enhance mood. Activities such as yoga and walking are particularly beneficial, fostering relaxation and mental clarity. Additionally, many find comfort in reading, which offers a positive distraction from everyday pressures and allows for a temporary escape into another world.Gardening is another wonderful way to relieve stress, as it combines physical activity with creative expression and a sense of achievement. Cultivating and caring for plants can be therapeutic, fostering a connection to nature and instilling a sense of pride and accomplishment. Moreover, engaging in creative endeavors like painting, drawing, or playing music serves as a valuable outlet for emotions and a constructive distraction from stress.In the end, the key to effective stress reduction is identifying activities that bring happiness and fulfillment, and incorporating them into one’s routine. Whether it involves exercise, reading, gardening, or creative arts, it’s vital to discover what resonates with each individual and prioritize stress management in daily life. By doing so, we can more effectively navigate the challenges of modern existence while safeguarding our physical and mental health."
72;In the modern world, the image (photograph or film) is becoming a more powerful way of communication than the written word. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""A picture is worth a thousand words"" is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time. This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, or opinions to people. Nevertheless, the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used. Hence, I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication.Firstly, pictures can influence the way people think. For example, nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking. As a result, statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit. Not only that, the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan. Apart from that, images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements. Thus, it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many.Looking from another perspective, written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages. With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images. Nonetheless, this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about. Furthermore, the primary way of educating students is also by this way. Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better.To conclude, both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words. Hence, for a more meaningful communication, these two elements have their respective roles to play: image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject.";The rise of technology has significantly transformed how we communicate, with images increasingly becoming a prominent mode of expression. I believe that in today's world, visual communication is surpassing the written word in its effectiveness.One key factor in this shift is the universal appeal of images. Unlike written language, which can be hindered by language differences, images can resonate with individuals from various linguistic and cultural backgrounds. A single photograph or video can express intricate concepts and emotions that go beyond words, making this form of communication more accessible and inclusive. Social media platforms like Instagram and YouTube exemplify this trend, as they thrive on the sharing and consumption of visual content.Moreover, images have the unique power to elicit profound emotions and create lasting impressions. A compelling visual can be far more memorable and impactful than written text, as it taps into our emotional responses, fostering a deeper connection with the audience. This effectiveness is particularly evident in advertising and marketing, where striking visuals are employed to capture attention and leave a significant impact.Nonetheless, it is important to acknowledge that written language still possesses its own distinct advantages. Text can convey more nuanced and detailed information and is often better at articulating complex ideas. However, in our contemporary landscape, visual communication is undeniably gaining prominence as it breaks down language barriers and evokes powerful emotional responses. As technology advances, we can anticipate an even greater role for images in the realm of communication.
73;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world. Some people, therefore, harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them. But the others do not believe it is possible. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue.First and foremost, it is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country. It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country. The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist. Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting. What is more, it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more.On the other hand, there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages. Although governments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results. As evidence of this, there are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those. These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular. In addition, the preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre. If they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money.In a nutshell, I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible. All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those.;"The decline of languages is a significant challenge in today’s globalized landscape. Numerous languages are spoken by only a few individuals, sparking a debate about whether governments should invest public resources in saving these endangered tongues. Advocates of language preservation assert that governments have an obligation to safeguard and promote their cultural heritage. Languages play a crucial role in shaping a community's identity and history; their disappearance would result in the loss of a distinctive cultural perspective. Additionally, funding initiatives for language preservation could generate jobs and boost local economies.Conversely, critics of government funding for language preservation argue that it constitutes a misuse of resources. They contend that, given limited public funds, governments should focus on more urgent matters such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. Furthermore, in an increasingly globalized society, the significance of mastering dominant languages like English or Mandarin is profound, leading some to believe that resources would be better allocated to promoting these widely spoken languages.In my view, although the practical concerns raised by critics are reasonable, I still believe that governments should dedicate resources to protecting endangered languages. Language is a crucial aspect of cultural diversity, and its extinction would have significant repercussions for the identity and traditions of communities. Moreover, preserving languages can enhance cultural exchange and understanding, fostering greater empathy and collaboration among nations. Therefore, I advocate for a balanced approach in which governments allocate funds for language preservation while also addressing immediate needs, ensuring that our world's rich cultural diversity is maintained for future generations."
74;Many people think arts and music do not improve the quality of life, and the government should spent money on other things rather than the arts such as music and painting, to what extent agree or disagree_;My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs.Art is not the key determination of quality of life, but education is. In order to make people better off, it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens. This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people's lives for a well-rounded social system.Admittedly, art, to some extent, serve a valuable function about enriching one's daily lives, for example, it could bring release one's heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work. However, it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries, in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room. By comparison to these issues, the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all.To conclude, art could play an active role in improving the quality of people's lives, but I think that governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs because those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life.;The argument that the arts and music fail to enhance quality of life and that government funds should be redirected elsewhere is a contentious one. While some contend that investing in the arts is an unaffordable luxury, I vehemently disagree.Firstly, the positive effects of arts and music on emotional and mental well-being are well documented. They offer avenues for expression, provide an escape from reality, and serve as sources of entertainment, all of which can significantly enhance one’s quality of life. Additionally, engagement with the arts has been linked to cognitive improvements, particularly in children, with studies showing that exposure to music and visual arts can boost creativity, spatial reasoning, and language skills.Conversely, governments that allocate resources to the arts often experience notable economic benefits. The tourism sector, for example, relies heavily on cultural venues such as museums, galleries, and music festivals, all of which generate considerable revenue and create job opportunities. A thriving arts environment also makes cities more appealing to businesses, entrepreneurs, and young talent, thereby promoting urban revitalization and economic development.In conclusion, I am convinced that arts and music are crucial elements of a fulfilling life, and that government funding in these areas is not only warranted but essential. Rather than reallocating funds to other sectors, governments ought to maintain their support for the arts, as they are integral to nurturing creativity, fostering innovation, and driving economic advancement, while also improving the emotional and mental health of the populace. This commitment can help build a more balanced, prosperous, and culturally enriched society.
75;Some people say the government should pay for the health care and education, but others say that it is not the government's responsibility. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Despite the development of modern society, the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens. And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens' health care and education.Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens. This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society. If citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk. As a result, such people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry. Also, without sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security. Therefore, the government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable.On the other hand, some people oppose the argument, saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society, since a great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately. Instead, the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members' wellbeing, such as soaring crime rate, AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure, which are requiring financial resources from the government to address.Personally, I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education, who are the group in real need for the authority's help. At the same time, citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas. After all, the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens.;The discussion surrounding whether the government should fund healthcare and education has generated vigorous debate among people. On one side, advocates argue that it is the government's duty to provide these vital services to its citizens. They contend that access to healthcare and education is a fundamental human right and that everyone, irrespective of their financial means, should be able to obtain these services. By covering these expenses, the government can help guarantee that all citizens have equal opportunities to thrive and maintain their health.Conversely, some believe that funding for healthcare and education should not fall on the government. They argue that these services ought to be offered by private entities, and individuals should take responsibility for their own expenses. This viewpoint suggests that government involvement can lead to inefficiencies and higher taxes, which could strain the economy. They also emphasize the importance of allowing individuals to select their own healthcare providers and educational institutions rather than being confined to government-operated options.In my view, I believe the government should take a significant role in providing healthcare and education to its citizens. While it is valid that government involvement can sometimes cause inefficiencies, I feel that the advantages of universal access to these services greatly outweigh the drawbacks. A healthy and educated populace is crucial for a country’s economic prosperity and progress. Additionally, by offering these essential services, the government can help alleviate poverty and reduce income inequality, fostering a more just and equitable society. Hence, I maintain that it is the government's responsibility to ensure that all citizens have access to quality healthcare and education, regardless of their financial circumstances.
76;Many people think zoos that keep wild animals in a man-made environment should be no longer exist in the 21st century. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Children tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen. When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society, animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned. I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education.There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system, which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals. In contrast, zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff. Once the animal got sick, professional vet will help them promptly. Thanks to the considerate care, the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed.Additionally, zoos afford a platform to education teenagers, helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals. In the zoos, even though wild animals are caged, they have capability to walk in a limited area. When children pay a visit to the zoos, they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals, which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals. Further, children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers.On the other hand, complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard. It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage. Also, being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals.In order to protect animals, from my perspective, zoos offer a good man-made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals. What the zoos should do is improvement of the management system and use the income wisely in preserving wild animals better.;The role of zoos in the 21st century has ignited significant debate, with many asserting that wild animals should no longer be housed in artificial environments. I partially concur with this viewpoint, recognizing that while zoos have made important strides in conservation and education, there are legitimate concerns about animal welfare.On one side, zoos are vital for the protection of endangered species and the promotion of conservation initiatives. They offer a sanctuary for animals that are threatened or no longer exist in the wild, and they provide valuable opportunities for research into animal behavior. Furthermore, zoos act as educational venues that raise awareness about conservation and the effects of human actions on wildlife. Many modern zoos have improved by creating more naturalistic habitats that reflect the animals' native environments, thereby enhancing their overall well-being.Conversely, there are valid concerns regarding the impact of captivity on the physical and mental health of wild animals. Those living in zoos may engage in abnormal behaviors, such as repetitive pacing or self-harm, stemming from limited space and insufficient stimulation. Additionally, certain zoos may prioritize entertainment over animal welfare, leading to subpar living conditions for the animals. These issues underscore the necessity for zoos to focus on animal welfare and meet rigorous standards.In conclusion, while I recognize the crucial role zoos play in conservation and education, I believe it is important to reevaluate their operations in the modern era. Instead of eliminating zoos, attention should be directed toward ensuring they prioritize animal welfare, create naturalistic habitats, and engage in genuine conservation efforts. By doing so, zoos can remain effective educational and conservation resources while honoring the needs and rights of the animals they house.
77;Some industrialized countries have serious environmental problems. The damage to the environment is an inevitable result when a country tends to improve the standard of living. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Currently, a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries. However, some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems. From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.Admittedly, some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments. As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards. Besides, people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems. As a result, unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources. In this view, the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting.However, I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment. With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today, triggering sales. For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.Furthermore, taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies. If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity. Therefore, it may spur its economic development. On the other hand, without the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic development.Therefore, I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously. On the other hand, I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources, technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas.;The idea that environmental degradation is an unavoidable result of a country's quest for a higher standard of living is a subject of ongoing discussion. While it's evident that industrialization and economic growth can lead to environmental complications, as illustrated by certain industrialized nations, I only partially concur with this viewpoint.On one hand, the process of industrialization and the enhancement of living standards often depend on the exploitation of natural resources as countries strive to boost their economic performance. This can lead to pollution from factories and vehicles releasing harmful emissions, as well as the destruction of ecosystems when forests are cleared for urban expansion and agriculture. For example, the rapid industrialization in countries like China and the United States has resulted in serious environmental challenges, including air and water pollution, which illustrates that industrial growth can indeed coincide with environmental harm.On the other hand, it is not necessary for environmental damage to occur alongside improvements in living standards. By implementing careful planning, adopting sustainable practices, and investing in renewable energy, countries can reduce the negative ecological effects of industrialization. Nations such as those in Scandinavia have shown that it is possible to harmonize economic growth with environmental conservation, proving that enhancing the standard of living doesn’t have to come at the expense of the environment.In summary, while there is a connection between industrialization, elevated living standards, and environmental issues, this relationship is not inevitable. With careful foresight, sustainable methods, and technological advancements, it is possible for countries to achieve both economic growth and environmental preservation. Thus, one can challenge the notion that environmental degradation is a necessary consequence of improving living standards, as there are viable alternatives and examples that showcase a more sustainable approach to development.
78;Some peopleÊargue that the government should spend money on public services and facilities, but not on the arts. Do you agree or disagree?;As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years, they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government. As a result, some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts. However, from my perspective, I think arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well.Admittedly, the government should give priority to public services and facilities. This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable. Simultaneously, public services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate. Therefore, public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability.On the other hand, I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government. Individually, arts can enrich people's cultural lives. Currently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition. Consequently, they require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure. Without arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems.From the point of the local community, funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development. Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts. This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry. In this view, arts serve cultural and economic purposes.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure. At the same time, the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous.;The debate over whether the government should prioritize funding for public services and facilities over the arts is a contentious one. While some argue that the arts are a luxury that the government cannot afford, I strongly disagree. I believe that investing in the arts is crucial for the well-being and growth of society.To begin with, the arts are essential for promoting cultural diversity and preserving national heritage. By supporting arts programs, as well as museums and galleries, governments can help safeguard historical artifacts and cultural traditions for future generations. This not only enhances our understanding of history but also strengthens national identity.Additionally, the arts offer a wide range of social and economic advantages. They can unite communities, provide entertainment, and generate employment opportunities. Numerous cities have witnessed substantial economic growth and revitalization through arts-driven community initiatives. Furthermore, involvement in the arts positively affects mental health and education, with research indicating that participation in artistic endeavors can boost cognitive skills and alleviate stress.It is also shortsighted to regard the arts as a non-essential expenditure that can be cut during economic downturns. The arts form a crucial part of society's fabric and significantly enhance overall quality of life. By investing in the arts, governments can foster a more vibrant, creative, and inclusive society that benefits all citizens.In summary, while funding for public services and facilities is undeniably important, I strongly advocate for the government to also allocate resources to the arts. The advantages of investing in the arts—ranging from cultural preservation to social and economic development—underscore its significance as an essential investment with a lasting positive impact on society.
79;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized. Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong. Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom. This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.On the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology. Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world. Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public. Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life. This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters. Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.In conclusion, both of the arguments have strong supports, but in my own view, more good come from zoos than bad. However, it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention.;I fully support the idea that animals should live freely and not be confined in zoos. Keeping animals in captivity can severely impact their physical and mental health. One major concern is that zoos fail to replicate the natural habitats and expansive environments that wild animals need. For example, elephants in zoos often display abnormal behaviors, like pacing and swaying, due to insufficient space and lack of stimulation.Furthermore, zoos frequently prioritize human entertainment over the well-being of the animals. Many enclosures are designed primarily for the amusement of visitors, which can lead to significant stress and trauma for the animals involved. A notable illustration of this is the practice of holding orcas in marine parks, which has drawn widespread criticism for the cramped and unnatural conditions imposed on these highly intelligent and social creatures.Moreover, confining animals in zoos can disrupt their natural social structures and behaviors. In the wild, many species operate within intricate social networks with established hierarchies. However, in zoos, these dynamics are often interrupted, resulting in heightened stress and unusual behaviors. For instance, the removal of a dominant individual from a group can trigger fighting and instability among the other animals.In summary, I strongly believe that animals deserve to be free rather than held in zoos. The negative consequences of captivity, coupled with the inability to provide natural environments and preserve social structures, far outweigh any supposed benefits of zoos. We should instead concentrate on conservation initiatives that safeguard animals in their natural habitats, enabling them to flourish in the way they were intended to.
80;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, picture, music or film) in whichever way they wish. There should be no government restrictions on what they do. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?;Artists in most countries are given the freedom to express their thoughts in whatever they do. Nevertheless, some argue that there should be government restrictions in order to limit their opinions. I however, agree to this only to a certain extent and believe that the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece.First and foremost, if there is control over artists' ideas, they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run. It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies. For example, paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times. In short, without any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists.Furthermore, it is every human's right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation. Today, many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries. Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country. To illustrate this further, the famous movie '3 Idiots' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn. Thus, human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely.Looking from another perspective, there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted. They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country. To cite an example, Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace. In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society. Nonetheless, I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts.To conclude, it is now evident that there should not be any restrictions on artists' work. Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves as ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations. Hence, even though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects, I certainly believe that there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas and thus, I strongly believe there should be no restrictions on them.;The belief that creative artists should enjoy absolute freedom to convey their ideas without government intervention is a divisive topic. While I acknowledge the importance of artistic expression in fostering a rich and diverse culture, I also contend that certain limitations are necessary to mitigate harm and uphold social responsibility.On one hand, the liberty of artistic expression paves the way for groundbreaking and thought-provoking creations that challenge social conventions and stimulate critical thought. Without constraints, artists can push boundaries, explore new concepts, and amplify the voices of marginalized communities. This type of freedom is vital for the evolution of art, literature, music, and film, as it encourages creativity, experimentation, and advancement.Conversely, unrestricted artistic expression can sometimes facilitate the spread of hate speech, obscenity, and harmful content, potentially causing offense, inciting violence, or reinforcing discriminatory views. In such situations, government regulations can play a crucial role in protecting vulnerable populations and preserving social harmony. For example, laws against child pornography, hate speech, or incitement to violence are necessary to prevent harm and safeguard public safety.In summary, while I firmly believe in the significance of artistic freedom for creative expression and cultural growth, I also recognize that some government restrictions are essential to mitigate harm and ensure social accountability. A balanced approach that upholds artistic freedom while protecting individuals from harm is the most suitable path forward. This can be accomplished through carefully designed laws and regulations that encourage artistic expression while safeguarding the welfare of society. Ultimately, the objective is to find a middle ground between artistic freedom and social responsibility, allowing artists to express themselves while minimizing harm to others.
81;Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone's life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is negative. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.Ê;Nowadays, the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers, radio and television has become very prevalent, so it is thought to be a necessary part of today's society. Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this. Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more. Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits. Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits. For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans. From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.However, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. Therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses.In conclusion, after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising, both of the views have strong support, but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad. Thus, the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported.;The pervasive nature of advertising in our everyday lives has ignited a vigorous debate regarding its societal impact. While some maintain that advertising brings about positive changes, others argue that its effects are detrimental. In this essay, I will explore both perspectives and present my own viewpoint.On one side, there are those who view advertising as a valuable component of modern life. It serves to inform consumers about new products, services, and concepts, potentially enhancing our lives by expanding our choices. For example, campaigns promoting life-saving medications or raising awareness about health issues can provide essential education about diseases and their treatments. Additionally, advertising can highlight cultural and social values, such as equality and environmental sustainability. Numerous companies leverage their marketing efforts to create awareness around critical social issues, fostering positive societal transformations.Conversely, some critics contend that advertising exerts a harmful influence. It can often be deceptive and manipulative, leading individuals to purchase items or services they do not actually need. For instance, ads promoting unhealthy foods or sugary beverages may contribute to rising obesity rates, particularly among children. Moreover, the overwhelming presence of advertising can foster a culture of consumerism and materialism, encouraging excessive consumption and wastefulness.In my view, advertising holds the potential for both positive and negative outcomes, depending on its application. It can deliver valuable information and advocate for social causes, yet it can also mislead and drive overconsumption. Consequently, it is crucial to implement regulations that ensure advertising is truthful and responsible. By doing so, we can mitigate its negative repercussions while amplifying its beneficial aspects. Ultimately, advertising is a powerful force that can shape our perceptions and behaviors, and it is our responsibility to wield it judiciously.
82;The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy.ÊThe advantages of nuclear technology outweigh the disadvantages. Do you agree or disagree ?;The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle. As far as my opinion is concerned, I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power. I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages.First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons. Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons. If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage.Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity. For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area. This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable.Last but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power. Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it. This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material.To sum it up, from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. Thus I suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes.;The assertion that nuclear power offers clean and affordable energy, with its benefits outweighing the drawbacks, remains a contentious subject. On one side, nuclear energy is indeed a clean alternative, as it generates no greenhouse gases or significant harmful emissions during its operation. This positions it as an appealing substitute for fossil fuels in addressing climate change. Additionally, nuclear power is a consistent and dependable energy source, unlike solar or wind energy, which can be sporadic.Conversely, the drawbacks of nuclear energy are significant and cannot be ignored. A primary concern is the generation of radioactive waste, which remains dangerous for thousands of years, creating substantial challenges for safe storage and disposal. Moreover, historical nuclear accidents, such as those at Chernobyl and Fukushima, have underscored the severe risks linked to nuclear power. These events not only resulted in immediate health and environmental hazards but also led to lasting repercussions.Furthermore, while the cost of producing electricity from nuclear energy may be relatively low once a facility is running, the initial capital expenditure for construction is notably high, and the expenses for decommissioning at the end of a plant's lifecycle must also be considered in the total cost. In summary, although nuclear power has notable advantages, such as offering a clean and consistent energy supply, the associated disadvantages—particularly concerning the risks tied to radioactive waste and potential accidents—are significant. Therefore, I maintain that the benefits of nuclear technology do not outweigh the drawbacks. A more nuanced perspective that evaluates all energy production methods, along with their respective advantages and challenges, is essential for fostering a sustainable energy future.
83;Some people argue that the government should give every unemployed person a mobile phone and should make sure they have access to the Internet. They believe this is the best way of using the public money to reduce the problem of unemployment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Today, the rate of unemployment is on the rise and is seriously being debated by many. Some opine that the best method to minimize this problem is by providing the unemployed with hand phones that have access to the Internet. They also believe that this solution is the most appropriate way to utilize the public money. Nevertheless, I agree to this solution only to a certain degree because I feel that giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money.In a positive point of view, when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet, they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities. For example, they can surf the The Star Onlines' work section to find a job that is suitable for them. With the help of the net, they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job. Not only that, the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with. In short, if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone, they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive.Nonetheless, looking from another perspective, supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers' money. This is because the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country. To illustrate this further, the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living. To conclude, the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed.Furthermore, when hand phones are provided for free, many would want to take advantage of this opportunity. It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone, they make themselves jobless. Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones. In this context, the public's money is spent worthlessly. On top of that, till now, there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment.To put it in a nutshell, the suggestion of providing those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment. I suggest the government look into the background of the people in depth before giving out hand phones to them. I strongly believe that the public money should be utilized for the benefit of the society and not just for some of them who are not willing to put in more effort to find them a proper work.;The idea that the government should supply every unemployed individual with a mobile phone and provide Internet access has generated considerable debate. While some view this as an effective way to use public funds to tackle unemployment, I only partially support this viewpoint.On one hand, supplying mobile phones and Internet access could significantly aid job seekers. It helps them stay connected with potential employers, receive job notifications, and utilize online job platforms. Additionally, the Internet is a treasure trove of information about job training, resume writing, and career advancement, which can be immensely beneficial for those in search of work. By bridging the digital divide, the government could empower unemployed individuals to actively seek employment opportunities and improve their job prospects.Conversely, I believe that allocating resources for mobile phones and Internet access is not necessarily the best use of public funds to combat unemployment. Other initiatives, such as vocational training programs, educational opportunities, and job creation efforts, might have a more immediate and substantial effect on reducing unemployment rates. Moreover, the expenses associated with launching and sustaining such a program could be considerable and might not be viable for governments with constrained budgets.In summary, while I recognize the potential advantages of providing mobile phones and Internet access to those without jobs, I feel this approach should be part of a more comprehensive strategy to address unemployment. The government ought to focus on initiatives that directly generate jobs, improve skills, and stimulate economic growth, and supplement these with efforts aimed at fostering digital inclusion. By employing a multi-pronged strategy, the government can more effectively use public resources to tackle unemployment.
84;The use of close circuit television (CCTV) cameras in streets, stations, shops and other public places has increased rapidly in recent years. Although we are told that these cameras help in the fight against crime, some people are opposed to their use. They believe that everyone has a right to privacy. What are your views?;Today, close circuit television (CCTV) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances. They are used in schools, businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place. It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer, especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise. Nevertheless, some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored. Even so, I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace.Firstly, by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down. This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced. To illustrate this further, in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight. Not only that, as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops. Thus, it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized.Furthermore, at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers. At times, face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger. Hence, the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded. In the event of an argument, the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken. In short, these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers.Looking from another perspective, the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy. Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras. However, one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences. Ergo, opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime.To conclude, CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise. This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers. Admittedly, privacies are lost with the use of these cameras. Nonetheless, safety should be put first in order to be safe.;The extensive deployment of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in public spaces has ignited a vigorous discussion regarding their societal implications. Supporters argue that CCTV serves as a powerful weapon against crime, deterring potential wrongdoers and facilitating the identification and prosecution of offenders. The presence of these cameras can enhance the public's sense of security, especially in areas with high crime rates or during nighttime. Additionally, recorded footage can provide crucial evidence during investigations, aiding in the resolution of criminal cases and the apprehension of offenders.Conversely, critics contend that CCTV cameras violate individuals' right to privacy. They argue that continuous surveillance encroaches upon personal space and fosters a climate of distrust among community members. There are also concerns surrounding access to the footage and its potential misuse, raising ethical questions. Some believe that the funds allocated for the installation and upkeep of CCTV systems could be more effectively invested in alternative crime prevention measures, such as community policing or social initiatives that address the underlying causes of criminal behavior.In my opinion, although the right to privacy is vital, the advantages of CCTV in promoting public safety and curbing crime surpass the associated privacy concerns. Nonetheless, it is essential to implement robust guidelines and regulations to oversee the responsible use of CCTV systems, ensuring secure management and storage of footage to guard against misuse. Promoting transparency regarding camera locations and purposes, coupled with regular audits to verify their ethical application, can help mitigate privacy anxieties. Ultimately, a balanced approach that weighs both public safety and individual rights is imperative for maximizing the benefits of CCTV technology.
85;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city? Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays living is possible on every place of the world, but still there are some differences among them. From my point of view big cities can be a good place for bringing up children.To begin with, it is undeniable that education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides. For instance, in my country the best schools, universities and institutes are located in cities, and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children's life. Therefore, it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities.What is more, it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities. Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment. For example playgrounds, parks, science museums, cinemas etc. However, in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities. Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms.Finally, in big cities children access to media easily, so they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net. Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world, therefor they can exchange their knowledge, they can learn different cultures.To sum up, although countrysides have some advantages such as fresh air, peace, and etc. Today's children needs somethings to entertain them, and occupy their leisure time in the best way.;The discussion on whether children are better off growing up in rural areas or large cities has persisted for many years. While some contend that cities offer greater opportunities and experiences, I strongly advocate for the advantages of a countryside upbringing for children.A key benefit of rural living is the cleaner, healthier environment. The air and water are generally fresher, and the slower pace of life fosters a more calm and serene childhood. In comparison, urban areas often suffer from pollution, noise, and dense crowds, which can be overwhelming and stressful for young ones. Moreover, the countryside offers ample room for children to play and explore, enabling them to forge a deeper connection with nature and engage in physical activities.Another important advantage of rural life is the stronger sense of community. Small towns tend to have a more tight-knit atmosphere where neighbors are familiar with one another and look out for each other, creating a safer and more nurturing environment for kids to grow up in. Additionally, the countryside promotes a simpler, more traditional lifestyle, allowing children to cultivate essential life skills such as self-sufficiency and resourcefulness.In summary, although cities may provide a wider array of amenities and opportunities, I firmly believe that the countryside is a more advantageous setting for childhood development. The cleaner surroundings, heightened sense of community, and relaxed pace of life all contribute to a healthier and more joyful upbringing. Therefore, I strongly maintain that rural areas are ideally suited for children to grow up and evolve into capable, well-rounded individuals.
86;Some people prefer to take a position in a company and work for the company. Other people think is better to go into business for themselves. Which do you think is better?;"There are many kinds of jobs in society. Some of them are done by companies that related to government, and some of them are done by privat companies. Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages, I would prefer to work for myself, and have my own business. There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others. In the first place, there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others. In your job you can be boss of yourself; however, in the other jobs someone else are your boss. You always have to be responsible for your task, and it make a stressful situation that I never like it.What is more, when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves, but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager. Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers, and from my point of view it is unfair.Finally, there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others. When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want. Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease, sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation. For all of them we have to ask for a permission, and most of the time we are not allowed.There is no doubt that working for the other have some advantages, too, but I imagine people that have their own business are more comfortable. They have more opportunities, profits, and authorities.";The long-standing debate over whether to work for a corporation or start one’s own business continues to ignite passionate discussions. While many find the security and consistency of corporate employment appealing, others argue that being one's own boss is the true path to success and fulfillment. Personally, I believe that entrepreneurship is the superior choice.On one hand, corporate jobs offer a sense of reliability and stability. Employees enjoy a steady paycheck, benefits, and a defined career trajectory. However, this stability frequently comes at the expense of creativity, independence, and growth potential. Employees often face restrictions on making decisions and taking risks, which can hinder innovation and development.Conversely, entrepreneurship provides unmatched freedom and flexibility. Business owners can follow their passions, make independent decisions, and enjoy the benefits of their efforts. While the journey to success can be fraught with uncertainty and risks, the opportunities for growth and return on investment are significantly greater. Additionally, entrepreneurs can create jobs, give back to their communities, and establish a lasting impact.Moreover, being an entrepreneur fosters a healthier work-life balance and enhances job satisfaction. By escaping the confines of a traditional 9-to-5 schedule, business owners can design a work routine that better aligns with their personal priorities. The fulfillment and pride derived from building a successful venture is unparalleled.In summary, although corporate employment has its advantages, I strongly advocate for pursuing entrepreneurship. The freedom, flexibility, and vast potential for growth that come with being self-employed far exceed the stability and safety of a job in a company. With significant risk comes great reward, and for those willing to take the plunge, the possibilities can be boundless.
87;"The expression ""Never,never give up"" means keep trying and never stop working for your goal. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?";"Many individuals throughout their life face with at least one failure in different areas such as education, love and economy. Some believe when a person faces with a failure the best way is to forget that and releases that; however, I completely disagree with this idea. I always believe that a defeated person has to try and try until to achieve her or his goal. First of all, when people face with a failure they can learn a large number of things from that failure, therefore in the next effort they try to avoid doing and repeating that mistakes. For instance, most of inventors in the first phases of their job face with some problems and defeats, but in the next stages they learn how to deal with problems.Second of all, experience shows while people doing a job constantly, they become more experienced in that subject, so in the final effort they become successful with the high percentile. For example, scientists experiment a substance for a long time, after they gain lots of experience and knowledge about that subject they decide to make it final.To sum up, I would maintain that people should not give up when they face with a failure. In opposite, they have to learn new points from that failure, and they become more experienced.";"The phrase ""Never, never give up"" serves as a powerful motivational mantra that has been championed by countless successful figures throughout history. It underscores the critical role of perseverance and tenacity in reaching one's objectives. I wholeheartedly endorse this message, as giving up often results in lost opportunities and unrealized potential.When confronting challenges and setbacks, it's all too easy to become disheartened and contemplate surrendering. Yet, the truth is that every successful individual has faced failures and difficulties along their path. Consider Thomas Edison, who famously remarked, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" His unwavering determination and refusal to concede ultimately paved the way for the invention of the light bulb.Moreover, surrendering can lead to feelings of regret and endless pondering of ""what ifs."" Picture if J.K. Rowling had decided to abandon her Harry Potter manuscript after facing multiple rejections from publishers. The world would have missed out on a cherished series that has touched the hearts of millions. By staying the course and diligently pursuing their ambitions, individuals can conquer even the most formidable challenges and achieve remarkable success.In summary, the phrase ""Never, never give up"" serves as an essential reminder that success frequently demands perseverance and resolve. By embracing this mindset, individuals can navigate obstacles, accomplish their goals, and unlock their full potential. As the esteemed poet Maya Angelou wisely said, ""You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can choose not to be diminished by them."" Thus, I firmly believe that the refusal to give up is crucial for attaining success and leading a fulfilling life."
88;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree with this point of view?;Nowadays there are some issues which many countries and nations are concern about that. Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals. From my point of view although endangered animals are important, human needs should be considered more.Firstly, day by day population is increasing, so human needs for food is increasing as well. We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn, and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks. Therefore, farmlands are vital for human life.Secondly, people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals, so they need land to build their houses on it. Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable.Finally, human need some crucial things to continue their life, and most of them are industrial such as medicine. Therefore, some lands should be assigned to industry. Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry. To conclude, the population of endangered animals are less than people's population, so they do not need so much land that people need. I would maintain that nowadays humans need farmland, housing and industry because of increasing population are more important than saving land for endangered animals.;The ongoing debate about whether to prioritize land preservation for endangered species or to meet human demands for farmland, housing, and industry has ignited significant discussion. Some argue that human needs should come first, but I strongly oppose this perspective.On one hand, the need for farmland, housing, and industry is undeniably important for human survival and economic advancement. However, when these needs overshadow the preservation of endangered species, the consequences can be dire and irreversible. The decline of biodiversity can disrupt fragile ecosystems, leading to severe repercussions for the environment, climate, and, ultimately, human health and well-being.Conversely, safeguarding land for endangered animals is not only a moral responsibility but also essential for achieving ecological balance. These species are integral to ecosystem health, and their extinction can result in widespread and devastating effects. Moreover, many endangered species hold the potential for groundbreaking medical and scientific advancements that could significantly benefit humanity.Instead of framing human needs and conservation efforts as opposing forces, I believe we can adopt a more harmonious approach. By embracing sustainable development and innovative technologies, we can lessen the environmental impact of human activities, thereby allowing for the coexistence of farmland, housing, and industry alongside protected areas for endangered species. It is essential for governments, organizations, and individuals to collaborate in creating and maintaining nature reserves, implementing conservation strategies, and advocating for eco-friendly practices.In summary, while meeting human needs is vital, I firmly believe that they should not overshadow the imperative to protect land for endangered species. Biodiversity preservation is a moral obligation and key to the long-term health of our planet. By pursuing a balanced and sustainable approach, we can foster the well-being of both humanity and the natural environment.
89;One should never judge a person by external appearance. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Individuals have two features, one of them is appearance and the other one is personality. From my point of view although appearance is important, personality is the most important. We can never judge about a person with his or her appearance. Some people believes, individuals who have black skin or are frown are not good person and in opposite individuals who have pale or white skin or always have smile on their face are good person. I completely disagree with these kind of judgement which someone makes.First of all, there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing, therefore we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance. For example, some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken; however, after getting marriage they show their real personality.Second of all, there are some people who are black skin, fat and frown, nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague. For instance, I have a neighbor who are old, black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her. One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys, so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home. She asked me to stay with her till my parents come, also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable. After that I understood, I had to never judge with people's appearance.All in all, the best way to judge about individuals' is to be familiar with their personality not with their appearance. Unfortunately, many people play role to cheat the others, and they try to hide their real personality with their appearance.";"The timeless saying ""never judge a book by its cover"" remains profoundly relevant today. I fully support this notion, as it underscores the importance of looking beyond someone's outward appearance to truly grasp their character, abilities, and value.Evaluating someone solely based on how they look can lead to misconceptions and misunderstandings. Physical traits, such as height, weight, or facial features, do not necessarily represent a person's intelligence, kindness, or talents. Additionally, individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds may possess various physical characteristics that should not be mistaken as markers of superiority or inferiority.Throughout history, there have been countless examples of individuals who were underestimated or misjudged due to their appearance, only to defy expectations. Take Albert Einstein, for instance—widely regarded as one of the greatest minds in history, he was often seen with unkempt hair and shabby clothing. Had people assessed him based merely on his appearance, they would have missed the chance to engage with his revolutionary ideas.Moreover, judging others based on appearances can lead to discrimination, bias, and social exclusion. It’s vital to understand that every person has their own unique story, experiences, and viewpoints that cannot be captured through their looks alone. By looking beyond the surface, we can cultivate a more inclusive, empathetic, and compassionate society.In summary, it is important to acknowledge that a person's true worth and character do not lie in their external appearance. We should endeavor to understand individuals for who they really are, beyond their physical traits. This approach will help dismantle social barriers, foster meaningful connections, and create a more harmonious and accepting community. Ultimately, the principle of not judging a person by their appearance is essential for appreciating the diversity and richness of the human experience."
90;Some people believe that there should be a single international language. Others believe that this would make it difficult to maintain the identity of cultures. What's your opinion?;The 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization, which raises people's concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not. From my perspective, a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people.It is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation. As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation. In contrast, without the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them. Therefore, a single international language serves an economic purpose.Also, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions. If people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles. For example, when people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience.In spite of this, the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied. To be more specific, a single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation. This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong. For instance, some Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries, due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English.Therefore, I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication. On the other hand, every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage.;The discussion surrounding the establishment of a single international language has ignited passionate debates among linguists, cultural advocates, and supporters of globalization. While some believe that a universal language would enhance global communication and foster unity, others argue that it could result in cultural homogenization and a diminishing of individual identities. Personally, I think that implementing a universal language would threaten the rich cultural diversity present around the world.On one side, a universal language would certainly ease international communication, allowing individuals from various countries to connect with greater ease. This would be especially advantageous in sectors such as business, science, and diplomacy, where effective communication is vital. Additionally, it would facilitate the sharing of ideas, knowledge, and cultural practices, ultimately promoting greater global understanding and collaboration.Conversely, embracing a single international language could jeopardize the survival of distinct cultural identities. Language plays a crucial role in a culture's heritage, and its disappearance would likely lead to the decline of traditions, customs, and values. The unique linguistic features, idioms, and expressions that define a culture might disappear as people become more reliant on a universal language. This would create a diminished cultural landscape, stripping away the diversity and richness that enrich human experience and reducing it to a bland, uniform existence.In summary, although a single international language may offer certain benefits, I strongly advocate for the importance of preserving cultural identities and linguistic diversity. Rather than enforcing a universal language, we should encourage language learning and cultural exchange, enabling individuals to appreciate and respect the multitude of languages and cultures that populate our world. By pursuing this approach, we can promote global understanding and collaboration while safeguarding the vibrant mosaic of human cultures.
91;Fashion trends are difficult to follow these days and it is believed that they primarily just to sell clothes. Some people believe that we should not follow them and that we should dress in what we like. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;With increasing availability to the Internet, people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world, such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year. However, some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends. From my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles.This is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations, which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today. When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world's cutting-edge fashion information, they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world, which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world. In contrast, if they stuck to their own fashion styles, disregarding the world's top fashion designers' achievements, they would stay conservative in their own worlds. As a result, they might fall behind shortly.Furthermore, people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information. Without following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles.Despite this, it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals' personalities. Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends, which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes. Consequently, the world would look monotonous.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that people should, especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge, care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world's changes. On the other hand, creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas, developing their own fashion styles as they like.;The fashion landscape is constantly changing, with fresh trends appearing each season. However, keeping pace with these trends has become increasingly difficult, leading many to view them as mere marketing tactics aimed at driving sales. Personally, I believe we should avoid mindlessly following fashion fads and instead prioritize clothing that allows us to feel confident and at ease.On one side, embracing fashion trends can serve as a form of self-expression, reflecting our personality and style. It can be an enjoyable way to stay informed about the latest trends and must-have items. Yet, the relentless need to stay fashionable can be exhausting and may foster a sense of superficiality. The focus on accumulating material goods and the pressure to frequently update our wardrobes can negatively affect both our finances and the environment.Conversely, choosing outfits that resonate with our personal tastes enables us to cultivate a distinctive style and express ourselves more authentically. This approach also encourages sustainability, as it lessens the compulsion to buy new clothes in order to keep up. Moreover, it refocuses our priorities on what truly matters: our comfort, confidence, and individuality. By selecting garments that we genuinely like, we signal that our preferences and tastes hold greater significance than the directives of the fashion industry.In summary, while following fashion trends can be enjoyable and creative, I contend that it is paramount to wear what makes us feel confident and comfortable. By doing so, we champion sustainability, individuality, and a truer form of self-expression. Ultimately, fashion should serve as a canvas for self-expression rather than a source of stress or pressure to conform.
92;Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth among poorer nations by providing such things as food and education? Or is it the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves?;"Whether wealthy nations should take responsibilities to help poorer ones, by means of providing infrastructures, or remain bystander of the global poverty, is an issue of controversy. Personally I think, as the privileged minority, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor.In terms of ethics, it is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help, especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so. Compassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals.Economically speaking, such aid could also create a win-win situation. Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds. For developed nations, new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem, promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry. The potential market in those poor countries, most of which has a huge population, is also a thing worth mentioning. By building a good relationship with them, wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market, but also facilitate future international commerce. The underdeveloped nations, in return, may export local agricultural products, mineral products with discount to the former, boosting each other's economy.In summary, wealthy nations' offering in need is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways. Only those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run.";"The discussion surrounding the obligation of wealthy nations to share their resources with poorer countries has ignited a vigorous debate. Advocates argue that offering food and education to those in need is a moral duty that can significantly reduce human suffering and foster global stability. With an abundance of resources at their disposal, affluent nations have the potential to make a substantial impact on poverty and inequality. Additionally, educational support empowers individuals and communities, enabling them to escape the cycle of poverty and achieve self-sufficiency.Conversely, some contend that the onus lies with the governments of poorer nations to care for their citizens. This viewpoint emphasizes that wealthy countries should not be expected to address the issues of other nations, highlighting the importance of national accountability for development. Moreover, providing assistance without fostering good governance and effective institutions may create dependency, disincentivizing local leaders from enacting necessary reforms.Nonetheless, a balanced strategy can be adopted, wherein affluent nations offer targeted assistance while simultaneously bolstering local capacities and institutions. Such support might involve investing in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, along with fostering trade and economic collaboration. Ultimately, the responsibility for a nation's growth rests with its government; however, wealthier countries can play a vital role in supporting and enhancing those efforts. By collaborating and sharing insights, expertise, and resources, we can strive for a more equitable and prosperous world for everyone. Wealthy nations have the power to significantly improve the lives of millions, and it is our shared duty to ensure that all individuals have access to life's fundamental necessities."
93;Out of our country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spend on health education and preventative measures.ÊTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment. Once applied, it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments.Health education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations. First of all, thank to a full health education from their childhoods, children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences. For example, if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age, he also keeps it when older. Secondly, health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases. Instead of afraid or panic, they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes. Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment. Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly.Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens. For example, vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu, smallpox, rubella so on. When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country, the community's health state will be improved remarkably. As human resources play a key role in the development of a country, investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision. In addition, because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention, the government can save a lot of money for our country's health budget.In conclusion, I strongly agree that we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment. However, reasonable attentions should be paid to treatment so that our citizens are always looked after with best services.;The distribution of a nation’s health budget is a crucial decision that can profoundly impact the wellbeing of its citizens. The argument posits that a substantial portion of this budget should be shifted from treatment to health education and preventive strategies. I largely concur with this perspective, as investing in health education and prevention offers long-term advantages for the overall health and wellbeing of the population.While treating illnesses and diseases is vital, it often represents a costly and reactive method of healthcare. In contrast, health education and preventive measures can significantly decrease the occurrence of diseases, consequently lowering the demand for treatment. By informing the public about healthy living, disease prevention, and early detection, individuals can take proactive measures to safeguard their health. This proactive stance can lead to considerable reductions in healthcare expenses as well as a lighter load on the healthcare system.Additionally, preventive initiatives such as vaccination programs, screening tests, and routine health checks play a crucial role in identifying and preventing diseases at an early stage, thus mitigating the need for expensive treatments. For instance, vaccination campaigns have been pivotal in managing and eradicating infectious diseases like smallpox and polio. By channeling resources into health education and preventive measures, a nation can foster a culture of health and wellbeing, resulting in a healthier and more productive populace.Nonetheless, it is also essential to recognize that treatment should not be neglected entirely. A balance must be achieved between investing in health education and preventive measures, and ensuring adequate treatment options are available for those in need. Ultimately, an effectively allocated health budget should prioritize both prevention and treatment, guaranteeing that citizens have access to comprehensive and efficient healthcare.
94;The popularity of news media often has significant influence on people' lives. Some people believe that to be a negative development. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays news media have become more and more popular. Many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits. However, it is possible that this idea is not completely true. It is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment, but also polishes up people' knowledge. Therefore, it seems not unreasonable to suggest that this is a positive development.First and foremost, today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before. The fact is that such news media as televisions, radios, or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody. People can sit in front of their televisions and watch whatever they want, from musical concerts to live football match. This is a convenient way of relaxation after hard work. Obviously, the popularity of news media is beneficial to human beings.In addition to this, news media help people broaden their knowledge. It is clearly seen that mass media provide people with a variety of global news on all fields, including political situation, economic change, global warming, and so forth. Hence, there is a strong likelihood that today people are able to know the world better. This is particularly essential when the globalization process has been permeating into all areas of society. Indeed, the fast growth of news media is helpful for people worldwide.In conclusion, the development of news media has been making great inroads into the lives of all people. It relaxes people with plentiful entertainment news. It enriches people's knowledge with worldwide information. It also positively affects the way people live in many other aspects. Therefore, the progress of news media is an advantageous development.;"The proliferation of news media has become an integral part of contemporary life, sparking significant discussion about its effects on individuals. While some contend that the widespread appeal of news media adversely affects people's lives, I respectfully disagree.Admittedly, overexposure to news can lead to ""compassion fatigue,"" where constant negativity results in a numbness toward others' suffering. Additionally, many news outlets tend to prioritize sensational stories over accurate reporting, which can induce unnecessary stress and anxiety in audiences. However, these issues can be addressed through mindful media consumption and a critical perspective on news coverage.Conversely, the advantages of having an informed and engaged populace far exceed these potential downsides. News media is vital for holding leaders accountable, amplifying marginalized voices, and encouraging public dialogue on important topics. By staying updated on current developments, individuals can make better-informed choices, engage in substantial discussions, and participate actively in democratic processes. Furthermore, the variety of viewpoints within the news can promote empathy, tolerance, and a richer understanding of the world’s complexities.In summary, while it is important to recognize the possible negative aspects of news media, I strongly believe that its overall impact is beneficial. By fostering media literacy, critical thinking, and responsible consumption practices, individuals can leverage the power of news media to become more engaged, knowledgeable, and proactive members of society. Ultimately, a well-informed and thoughtful public is crucial for the vitality of democracy and the advancement of society as a whole."
95;Under British and Australian laws, a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?Ê;It is a well known fact that a jury involved in a case has no information regarding the criminal's past illegal acts under the British and Australian laws. There are few of those who are concerned think the current practice should be altered and that the juries should at least know something about the criminals before coming to a conclusion. I, for one, agree to this resolution whole-heartedly as it poses advantages to various parties as I shall discuss below.First and foremost, I believe that it would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal. This is because, knowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment. For instance, take a person who has not murdered anyone but is suddenly found to be guilty. The juries will be able to know weather the individual committed the crime intentionally or due to circumstances by knowing the facts about the person. Then, punishment can be given in accordance to the condition.Apart from that, a fair trial can be achieved. As all of us know, juries are a group of people who have no or less knowledge regarding law. Thus, exposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision. By doing so, the juries will have a sense of relief that they have come up with better conclusion based on plenty of evidences. Not only that, the convicted will also receive a fair action.It is undeniable that when the background of the convicted is 'dug' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people, his privacy is being jeopardized. If finally he is proven innocent, he may feel embarrassed to face the public. However, I am sure that the crimes done by criminals should be brought to light and the public should be aware of it so that they will not become a victim as well.To conclude, I definitely feel that the current way of the juries judging the case should be transformed and they should know the facts about the criminals they are dealing with. This is of paramount importance so that they will be able to give a better and reliable as well as a fair judgment to the convicted. Beneficial changes will certainly take place if changes are made because for a change to happen, changes have to be done.;The practice of keeping a defendant's previous criminal record from the jury in a criminal trial is a well-established principle in both British and Australian law. The main objective of this approach is to guarantee that the defendant is afforded a fair trial, with the jury's verdict based exclusively on the evidence presented in the case at hand. I firmly oppose the idea that this practice should be altered to allow juries access to a defendant’s past criminal history.Revealing a defendant’s previous offenses could introduce bias and prejudice, potentially swaying the jury's judgment. The jury's task is to evaluate the defendant's guilt or innocence based solely on the evidence available in the current case, rather than to pass judgment based on past actions. If jurors are aware of a defendant's history, they might unfairly leap to a conclusion of guilt, even when the evidence in the present case is not definitive. This could lead to wrongful convictions and compromise the integrity of the legal system.Moreover, a defendant's past record may not be pertinent to the issues at hand and might not accurately reflect their character or conduct. By keeping this information hidden, jurors are compelled to concentrate on the relevant facts of the current case and render a decision solely based on the presented evidence. This practice upholds justice by ensuring that the defendant is tried fairly. In summary, the existing protocol of excluding a defendant's previous criminal record from jury consideration is a crucial component of a fair trial and should remain unchanged. It protects the rights of the accused and ensures that judicial decisions are guided by evidence rather than past errors or transgressions.
96;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Whenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place, it attracts millions of people all over the world. As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border, popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely.First and foremost, sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results, break records and bring victories to their own countries. Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events, there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures. Consequently, sport events with the spirit of healthiness, honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding, friendship and solidarity among nations. After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition, the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners, which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations.Secondly, sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators. Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete. The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country. When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness. For instance, when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets. People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President. The eager atmosphere lasted many next days. In fact, some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally. However, the hooligans only took a minority of people. Therefore, it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen.In conclusion, international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely. Hence, I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future.;The idea that major events such as the football World Cup and other international sporting competitions help alleviate global tensions and channel patriotic feelings in a constructive manner is a subject of contention. While some contend that these occasions promote unity and camaraderie among nations, I hold a partially supportive view of this perspective.On one hand, these events do serve as a venue for countries to unite and celebrate their shared passion for sport.  On the other hand, they can also heighten existing rivalries and generate new conflicts. The fierce competition and intense national pride often associated with these events can lead to heightened nationalist sentiments. In summary, international sporting events like the football World Cup manifest both beneficial and detrimental effects on global tensions and expressions of patriotism.
97;In many countries, children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard as completely wrong, while others consider it as some kind of work experience, important for learning and taking responsibilities.ÊWhat are your opinions on this?;In many countries, children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions. Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities. However, some people think it's not a good educational measure. From my point of view, the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks.First of all, children can learn about the hardship of earning money. When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies, doing housework and keeping shops, they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life. Therefore, they are likely to understand their parents' hardship, to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving.Secondly, when children take jobs, they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working. To keep their jobs, children will have to try their best to finish their duties. For example, if a child works as a shop assistant, he will have to keep an eye on good and products, calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost.Some people may argue that children will be more material, neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers. However, if children get good care and instructions from their parents, they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way.In conclusion, if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents' permission, they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible. I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children 's study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children's labour.;The topic of children participating in paid work is a highly debated issue, with differing viewpoints on its advantages and disadvantages. Some individuals strongly oppose the practice, highlighting concerns about exploitation and potential harm to a child's well-being. Conversely, others argue that such work can be a beneficial learning experience, fostering responsibility and essential life skills. In my view, whether children should engage in paid work depends largely on the type and context of that work.On one side, it's clear that certain kinds of paid work can negatively impact a child's physical, emotional, and educational growth. Children compelled to work long hours in dangerous or exploitative environments may experience physical harm, psychological distress, and a lack of educational opportunities. Such situations are clearly unacceptable and warrant strong condemnation.However, it’s important to recognize that not all paid work is the same. Some jobs, like part-time positions or internships, can offer children valuable skills, experiences, and a sense of responsibility. These roles can teach important life skills such as time management, teamwork, and financial literacy, while also enhancing their education with practical experience.In conclusion, finding a middle ground is essential to this discussion. It is vital to safeguard children's rights while also offering them valuable learning opportunities. Governments, employers, and parents need to collaborate to ensure that any paid work undertaken by children is secure, well-regulated, and aligns with their educational needs. By doing so, we can nurture children into capable, responsible, and productive members of society, while simultaneously protecting them from exploitation and harm.
98;In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Nowadays, it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies. It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students. Students take a break of year or two, some students travel all around the world during this time, and some choose to take up a job.Experience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people and even at job goes long way. It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent. Student's who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies. This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life. They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses.Taking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts. Once student's starts earning, they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence. They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment. There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education. Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education, which will help them to get a better job and salaries. This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs, one needs a proper and higher qualification.In my view point, I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education. Students who take break, gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working. They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature.;The trend of taking a gap year between high school and college enrollment has become increasingly popular around the globe. This hiatus offers young people the opportunity to work, travel, or participate in activities that promote personal development. While there are notable benefits to taking a gap year, there are also some potential downsides that should be carefully evaluated.On the upside, a gap year can equip young individuals with essential life experiences and skills. Employment during this time helps them acquire practical knowledge, foster a sense of responsibility, and earn money for their future educational expenses. Traveling, in contrast, enriches their cultural awareness, introduces them to different lifestyles, and boosts their independence. Moreover, a gap year allows students to contemplate their academic and career aspirations, which can result in a more intentional and driven approach when they begin their university studies.Conversely, there are some drawbacks to consider. A primary concern is that taking time off may disrupt the continuity of academic learning, potentially diminishing study habits and retention of high school knowledge. Additionally, postponing university could disadvantage students when compared to peers who advance directly, particularly in competitive fields where an early start can be crucial. Furthermore, not all gap year pursuits are productive or secure, leaving some individuals in unsuitable or precarious situations.In summary, while a gap year can provide valuable opportunities for personal growth, practical experience, and financial benefits, it may also pose challenges such as academic interruption and competitiveness. Ultimately, the choice to embark on a gap year should take into account personal circumstances and objectives, ensuring that the experience contributes positively to future academic and career success.
99;The qualities a person needs to become successful in today's world cannot be learned at a university or similar academic institution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's modern and competitive society, it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life. Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions. I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree. Nevertheless, I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities.First and foremost, it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor, engineer and lawyer. Without proper training and knowledge, it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers. Not only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners. This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals.Looking from another perspective, there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university. Take for instance those who start their own business. These people depend solely on hard work and luck. Interestingly, for some of them it proved to be a profitable job. To cite an example, Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19. Initially, he started his computer company in his college dorm room. Eventually, he used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now.In addition, people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life. This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports. The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph. To illustrate this further, David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many. Hence, it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful.To wrap it all up, it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper. However, it would be wrong to say that one's success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions. Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress.;The debate over whether the traits necessary for success in today's world can be cultivated in academic settings like universities is ongoing. While I recognize that these institutions provide a solid groundwork of knowledge and skills, I partly agree that true success demands characteristics that extend beyond academic teachings.Universities and colleges furnish students with theoretical understanding, a strong work ethic, and critical thinking abilities, all of which are vital for achieving success. However, qualities such as adaptability, resilience, creativity, and effective communication are equally important in our fast-paced and constantly evolving environment. These soft skills are often developed through real-life experiences, internships, and interpersonal interactions, which cannot be fully replicated within the classroom walls.Additionally, traits like entrepreneurial spirit, emotional intelligence, and the capacity to handle uncertainty are crucial for success, particularly in the realms of innovation and leadership. Often, these qualities stem from hands-on experiences, networking opportunities, and lessons learned from setbacks—areas that traditional academic environments may not sufficiently cover.That said, it's important to acknowledge that academic institutions do offer opportunities for students to cultivate some of these essential traits through project-based learning, group work, and extracurricular activities. Thus, while universities lay the foundational knowledge, a successful combination of academic training and practical experiences is what truly nurtures the diverse qualities needed for success in today's world. In summary, I believe that although academic institutions are vital, they represent only one facet of the journey to success, with real-world experiences being just as, if not more, crucial.
100;People should be allowed to continue to work for as long as they want to, and not forced to retire at a particular age such as 60 or 65. Do you agree or disagree?Ê;The appropriate age at which a person should stop working is now a much debated issue in the society. Some opine that people should be given the option to choose when they want to call it a day while others oppose this notion. In my personal point of view, the right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old. I, for one, strongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age due to several reasons that I shall discuss below.First and foremost, if senior workers dominate the working sector, there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates. As a result, most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for. To illustrate this further, a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day, he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available. On top of that, due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option, there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace.Apart from that, not all elderly workers are physically well. Beyond that age, a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses. To cite an example, the stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him. Consequently, they will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing. Besides, the academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills, resulting in more loss for the institution. Thus, it would indeed be better if at an older age, opportunities are given to the younger ones.Admittedly, the expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated. Their invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering, medicine, and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation. Hence, it is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge.In conclusion, it is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement. There will come a certain time when the older generation should hand over the responsibility to the fresh comers who are certainly waiting to be given a choice to prove themselves. After all, retirement not only marks the end of an individual, but also gives him a chance to make up for what he has lost throughout his working life.;"The concept of mandatory retirement at a certain age has been a subject of ongoing discussion. While some contend that such policies are essential for fostering job opportunities for younger generations, I firmly assert that individuals should have the freedom to work as long as they choose. Imposed retirement ages, like 60 or 65, can be harmful to those who are still capable and eager to contribute to the workforce.Mandating retirement can result in the loss of valuable skilled workers, which is especially detrimental in fields that rely on specialized knowledge and expertise. Additionally, many individuals depend on their jobs not just for financial security, but also for social interaction and a sense of purpose. Being forced to retire sooner than they wish can lead to feelings of isolation and boredom, ultimately impacting their mental and physical well-being.Conversely, permitting individuals to work for as long as they desire can yield numerous advantages. It can cultivate a more experienced and skilled labor force and stimulate economic activity. Many older employees are also eager to mentor and train younger colleagues, facilitating the transfer of knowledge and skills to future generations. Moreover, given the rising cost of living and increasing life expectancy, many may find their savings insufficient for retirement; thus, continuing to work can offer essential financial support.In summary, I strongly advocate that individuals should have the option to work for as long as they wish. It is vital to acknowledge the value and contributions of older workers and to create opportunities for them to remain in the workforce if they desire. By doing so, we can foster a more diverse, experienced, and skilled labor force that benefits individuals and society as a whole."
101;Some people claim that public museums and art galleries will not be needed because people can see historical objects and works by using computer. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"I believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary, even though we can see the art works and historical objects online.Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience. We can browse the art work from all over the world at home. However, people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size. By contrast, the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling. For example, only when we see the real mummy, can we experience mystique.In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits, museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing. For example, at American Museum of Natural History, you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum's stegosaurus; at Museum of Art in New York, you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music. While if you ""visit"" the museum online, you may not able to get this kind of experience.Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes. For instance, you can't see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist. What's more, not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen. Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough. These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects.In conclusion, I believe we still need museums and art galleries but computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects.";The idea that public museums and art galleries may become irrelevant due to the advancement of digital technology has sparked significant debate. While it’s true that computers and the internet enable individuals to view historical artifacts and artworks from the comfort of their homes, I firmly believe that this advancement will not eliminate the necessity of physical museums and galleries.On one side, digital technology has certainly enhanced accessibility to cultural and historical material. With just a few clicks, anyone can explore exhibitions and view artworks from across the globe. This is particularly advantageous for those with mobility challenges or those living in remote locations. Nevertheless, experiencing a digital representation of an artwork or historical artifact is inherently different from witnessing it firsthand.Conversely, physical museums and galleries provide a distinctive and immersive experience that digital technology cannot replicate. Elements like texture, scale, and contextual surroundings are crucial for grasping the importance and impact of an artwork or historical item. Additionally, these venues create social and communal spaces where visitors can connect with one another, share experiences, engage in guided tours, and participate in workshops. The sensory and emotional bonds that individuals form with tangible objects and artworks are vital for cultivating a deeper understanding and appreciation of culture and history.In summary, while digital technology has broadened access to cultural and historical resources, it is unlikely to replace the need for physical museums and art galleries. The unique experiences and benefits these institutions offer ensure their ongoing relevance, providing spaces for individuals to engage with and appreciate the richness and diversity of human culture and history.
102;Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?;Courts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant, except those of the UK and Australia. Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries.Many people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions, which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury. We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant's personality. Furthermore, past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes, such as kidnapping or a murder.Nevertheless, in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience, the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only. For instance, a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record. Innocent suspects, eventually, can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions.In conclusion, I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant's history to the jury, with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict. Thus, I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia, and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions.;"The longstanding practice of keeping a defendant's prior criminal history from a jury in criminal cases is a fundamental aspect of British and Australian law. Its primary intent is to guarantee the defendant a fair trial, free from prejudicial influences. I firmly oppose any proposal to alter this practice by allowing juries access to a defendant's past record before making their decision.Knowledge of a defendant's previous offenses can skew a jury's judgment, possibly resulting in an unjust verdict. The jury's duty is to assess whether the defendant is guilty of the specific charge at hand, not to mete out punishment for prior actions. By concealing the defendant's history, jurors can concentrate solely on the current case's evidence, without being distracted by unrelated details.Additionally, incorporating a defendant's past conduct into the trial could foster a ""guilty by association"" mindset, where jurors may assume guilt based on past behavior rather than the evidence specific to the current charges. This contradicts the essential principle of ""innocent until proven guilty"" and risks wrongful convictions.In summary, the existing practice of excluding a defendant's previous criminal record from jury consideration is crucial for maintaining a fair trial. It enables jurors to focus on the evidence relevant to the case at hand, rather than being swayed by potentially irrelevant and prejudicial information. Adjusting this practice could lead to unjust outcomes and compromise the integrity of the justice system. Therefore, I strongly oppose the notion that juries should have access to all past details before reaching their verdict."
103;University lecturers are now able to put their lectures on the internet for students to read and so the importance of attending face to face lectures has been reduced. Do you believe the use of Internet in formal education is a good idea and what are the effects that the internet has on future academic study?Ê;Over the past few decades, the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization, especially in field of education. This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students. Consequently, direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized. However, the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists. Personally, I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning.First and foremost, the Internet is an adequate source of academic information, which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils. Nowadays, not only are lectures available online, it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace. As such, the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever. Moreover, with the use of the Internet, distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance. College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries. Last but not least, the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying. While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes, Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query.In the near future, the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, for the enormous benefits that it brings about. Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously? This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances.Critics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively, for instance internet abuse and black webs. However, we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself. Thus, what we are to do is a change in learners' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study.After analyzing both points of view, I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process. It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages. However, it is not just the matter of help or hindrance, it is the way you use the cyberspace. Be wise and conscious.;The emergence of the internet has transformed the delivery of education, allowing university lecturers to share their lectures online for student access. This shift has diminished the necessity of attending in-person classes and sparked discussions about the internet's role in formal education. Personally, I believe that utilizing the internet in educational settings is beneficial, albeit with both positive and negative implications for future academic pursuits.On one side, the internet grants students exceptional access to educational materials, enabling them to learn at their own pace and revisit content as needed. This is especially advantageous for those who may have missed a lecture or require additional reinforcement of challenging topics. Furthermore, online lectures can reach a broader audience, promoting accessibility and equity in education.Conversely, a heavy reliance on online lectures can diminish engagement and interaction with teachers and fellow students—elements that are vital for effective learning. In-person lectures foster opportunities for dialogue, debate, and clarification that are hard to replicate in an online setting. Additionally, the lack of non-verbal cues and immediate feedback can detract from the overall learning experience.In summary, while the internet has lessened the significance of attending in-person lectures, it should not be seen as a substitute for traditional teaching methods. A well-rounded approach that merges online resources with face-to-face engagement is likely to produce the best outcomes. As technology continues to advance, it's essential to harness its capabilities to enhance rather than replace the educational experience. By doing so, we can ensure that future academic endeavors are enriched, equipping students with the necessary skills and knowledge to thrive in an increasingly digital landscape.
104;Many people in the undeveloped world die from diseases that are curable because they can't afford the medication to treat themselves. Do you believe that drug companies in the developed world should be obliged to make their products available at reduced prices in these undeveloped countries so that people do not die unnecessarily?;At present, a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases. It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths.Admittedly, more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines. The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs. With advanced technology, the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines, which can cure a variety of serious illnesses. If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs, their health situations may be better. The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity.However, the current cost of medicines is , in fact, reasonable and based on the medicines' effectiveness. Apparently, the process of researching, testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money. Moreover, these products prove to ensure human health completely. Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs, they would make no profit, even running up debt because of production expenditure. Therefore, the measure cannot be adopted, otherwise those companies will go into liquidation. In short, this is not a long-term solution.Fortunately, there are other measures to improve the situation. It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes. Additionally, charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free.In conclusion, I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines, which may exacerbate their qualities. Instead, the government and medical foundations should be responsible for the distribution of drugs to the undeveloped world at a more reasonable price.;"The disparity in access to medication between developed and developing countries is a critical global issue. In many impoverished nations, millions succumb to diseases that are treatable simply because they cannot afford essential medications. It is essential to address the role that pharmaceutical companies play in closing this healthcare gap. I believe that drug manufacturers in wealthier nations have a moral obligation to offer their products at lower prices in developing countries.By taking this step, these companies can help prevent needless deaths and reduce the impact of treatable diseases on vulnerable populations. While it is true that lowering prices might affect investment in research and development, this argument does not excuse the loss of human lives. A more balanced approach is possible, where companies maintain their profitability while ensuring that their medications remain accessible. This can be accomplished through tiered pricing structures or collaborations with governments and non-profit organizations.Additionally, providing affordable medications in developing nations can yield long-term benefits for pharmaceutical companies, such as expanding their market presence and building goodwill. It's crucial to recognize that this issue is not only a humanitarian crisis but also a significant economic challenge; the loss of productive individuals can impede a country's progress. Therefore, I strongly advocate that pharmaceutical companies should be required to offer their products at reduced prices in developing countries. This is not only a matter of social justice but also a vital step toward achieving global health equity. By pursuing this course of action, we can strive for a future where access to life-saving medications is a fundamental right, rather than a privilege reserved for the wealthy."
105;Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree?;The awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors. As a result, some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area. It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run.Firstly, it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time. Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking. A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases. Therefore, the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented.Secondly, the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender. For instance, the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés, hospital and shopping street. This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result, Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness. This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole.To sum up, the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation. It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country.;The debate surrounding smoking in public spaces and workplaces has persisted for many years. While some contend that individuals should have the freedom to smoke wherever they choose, I strongly believe that smoking should be entirely prohibited in public areas and offices.To begin with, smoking presents severe health risks not only to the smoker but also to those nearby. Second-hand smoke, or passive smoke, has been scientifically shown to lead to various health issues, including lung cancer and heart disease. By implementing a ban on smoking in public spaces and offices, governments and organizations can take essential steps to safeguard the health of citizens and employees.Additionally, smoking can create considerable distractions and disruptions within the workplace. The odor of smoke is often unpleasant and can irritate non-smokers, while the habitual breaks that smokers take can reduce overall productivity and efficiency. Furthermore, smoking can damage property and leave behind unwelcome smells and stains.Moreover, restricting smoking in public venues and workplaces can contribute to lowering the number of smokers and discourage young people from starting the habit. If smoking is deemed unacceptable in public settings, it may help change perceptions and make the behavior less attractive to others. This shift can result in long-term health advantages for both individuals and society as a whole.In summary, although some may argue that smoking bans infringe on personal freedoms, I firmly maintain that the advantages of prohibiting smoking in public spaces and offices far exceed any perceived disadvantages. By prioritizing the health of citizens and employees and fostering a healthier, more productive atmosphere, governments and organizations can positively influence society. For these reasons, I strongly advocate for a complete ban on smoking in all public places and offices.
106;Some people say we humans are harming the Earth through our activities, but other people say we are improving the quality of life on our planet. Which opinion do you agree with ?;"""Save the planet Earth"" is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world. There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments. Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable, but concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons.Firstly, rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world. The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life. As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas. Moreover, wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth.Secondly, large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer. Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays. To add to it, excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers.Lastly, either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth. For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent. Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers.To conclude, Earth is our home and it should be protected. Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage. Creative ideas should be encouraged to leave minimum environmental footprints without compromising quality of life.";The discussion surrounding the effects of human activities on our planet has intensified in recent years. While some contend that our actions have improved life on Earth, I strongly believe that we are inflicting harm on the environment.The evidence of ecological decline is irrefutable. Issues like deforestation, pollution, climate change, and the extinction of species exemplify the severe consequences of human behavior. For example, the over-reliance on fossil fuels has led to a dramatic rise in greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in increased temperatures and more frequent natural disasters. Additionally, the widespread pollution of our oceans and waterways has not only jeopardized marine ecosystems but has also tainted the food chain, posing serious risks to human health.Conversely, some argue that human endeavors have enhanced life on Earth through advancements in infrastructure, technology, and healthcare. However, these benefits come with significant environmental repercussions. The manufacturing and disposal of technological devices contribute to electronic waste and pollution, while the growth of infrastructure often leads to habitat destruction and a reduction in biodiversity.In summary, the damage inflicted by human activities on the planet far exceeds any perceived advantages. It is crucial that we take prompt action to reduce this impact and adopt sustainable practices to safeguard the Earth for future generations. This requires a concerted effort to lessen our carbon footprint, conserve natural resources, and protect endangered species. Ultimately, it is our duty to ensure that our actions foster the planet's preservation and well-being, rather than cause irrevocable harm.
107;Some people believe that in order to give opportunities to new generations, companies should encourage high level employees who are older than 55 to retire. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy. Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young, others claim that this is not the case.Admittedly, encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits. Firstly, fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation. This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities. Secondly, having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency. Compared with aged staffs, younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline.However, sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences. From personal level, it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations. It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it, disregard the age and physical capacity. From social perspective, massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government. For example, sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently.In conclusion, even though the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits, it is convincing that it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly.;The notion that companies should urge high-level employees over the age of 55 to retire in order to create opportunities for younger generations is a controversial topic. While proponents claim this strategy can introduce fresh ideas and perspectives, I disagree with this viewpoint.On one hand, it is true that the retirement of older employees can open up positions, allowing younger talent to step in and embrace new challenges. This shift might foster innovation and increase diversity in the workplace, given that younger generations bring distinctive experiences and skills. However, this perspective fails to recognize the ongoing value and contributions that seasoned employees can provide.Conversely, older employees often hold significant knowledge, expertise, and leadership abilities that have been developed over many years. Pushing them into retirement can result in a considerable loss of institutional knowledge and mentorship opportunities. Many of these employees remain highly productive and motivated, and their extensive experience can be invaluable in guiding and training younger colleagues. Additionally, with advances in healthcare and increased longevity, individuals over 55 are often more than capable of continuing to make meaningful contributions to their organizations.Instead of promoting retirement, companies should strive to cultivate a workplace that appreciates and leverages the skills of all employees, regardless of age. This can include fostering knowledge transfer, implementing mentoring programs, and offering flexible work options that cater to various life stages. By embracing age diversity and encouraging collaboration between generations, organizations can harness the strengths of both older and younger employees, resulting in a more dynamic and successful workplace. In summary, while the intention behind advocating for older employees to retire may be to create openings for new generations, I do not support this strategy.
108;Some people believe that the media, such as the press, TV and internet should be more strictly controlled. Others feel that controls should be loosened to give people freer access to information. Which opinion do you agree with?;Nowadays, one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers, televisions and websites. It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public. However, I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures.One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content. They have a serious impact on people in their puberty. For example, an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off. Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture. A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser. This is actually very environmentally unfriendly.The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens. In other words, the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner, especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases. Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example, the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths. Even so, another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest.Both sides of the arguments have its merits. My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety, the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information. Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea.;The ongoing debate about media regulation has persisted for years, with some calling for stricter oversight while others advocate for increased accessibility to information. After thorough consideration, I am convinced that media controls should be relaxed to enhance public access to diverse information.On one side, an entirely unregulated media environment can facilitate the spread of inaccurate or misleading information and the misuse of sensitive or explicit content. Nevertheless, I believe the advantages of a more open media framework significantly outweigh these potential risks. Easing restrictions allows individuals to access a broader spectrum of information, empowering them to make well-informed choices and engage in meaningful discussions.Furthermore, stringent media regulations can often serve as a means of censorship, suppressing dissenting opinions and hindering the exchange of ideas. In a democratic society, the unrestricted flow of information is crucial for holding authorities accountable and fostering transparency. By expanding access to information, we enable citizens to actively participate in the democratic process and contribute to an informed and engaged populace.In conclusion, while some level of regulation may be necessary to curb the spread of harmful or inappropriate content, I believe media should be subjected to minimal constraints. By trusting individuals to critically assess and interpret the information they encounter, we can nurture a more open, educated, and democratic society. Relaxing media controls is vital for enhancing freedom of expression, access to information, and the interchange of ideas, all of which are cornerstones of a thriving and functioning democracy.
109;Some people think that paying taxes is enough to contribute to the society. Others argue that being a citizen involves more responsibilities. Discuss, what is your opinion?;There is a controversial debate around the world about the duties of citizen. Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens, while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities.Taxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries. If people are paying taxes, that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country's economy. Therefore, they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen.Some people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax. In fact, in order to develop a country, citizens must obey laws, which were imposed by the government. In this way, the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place, so the country will develop at a rapid pace. Furthermore, being a citizen in society should protect the country's culture and history. For instance, people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books. On the other hand, a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation. Indeed, if people in society have a strong bond with each other, society will become a peaceful place, where people are helping and sharing to each other.Taking everything into account, I strongly believe that being a citizen involves in a number of duties, other than paying taxes. People in society must do more than paying taxes to contribute to their society.;"The idea that paying taxes alone fulfills one's duty to society has ignited a discussion among people. While some argue that meeting tax obligations is sufficient, others contend that true citizenship requires a wider array of responsibilities. I align myself with the latter perspective.Undoubtedly, paying taxes plays a vital role in citizenship by providing essential funding for public services and infrastructure. However, this represents just one dimension of a citizen's broader civic duties. Individuals have a moral responsibility to engage with their communities, participate in the democratic process, and contribute to the overall well-being of society. This can take the form of volunteering, community service, and active involvement in local governance.Additionally, being an informed and responsible citizen means staying informed about current events, critically assessing information, and making educated decisions. It also involves honoring the rights and dignity of fellow citizens, fostering social unity, and advocating for the common good. By embracing these values, individuals can help cultivate a more harmonious and equitable society.In summary, while paying taxes is a fundamental obligation of citizenship, it certainly is not the only one. True citizenship encompasses a comprehensive commitment to the community, the environment, and the democratic process. As responsible members of society, we should aim to transcend our tax duties and engage actively with our communities, paving the way for a brighter future for generations to come. In doing so, we can foster a sense of shared responsibility and collective ownership, ultimately leading to a more prosperous and cohesive society. Ultimately, citizenship involves more than just fulfilling tax responsibilities; it requires a commitment to a wider range of duties that contribute to the common good."
110;Testing on animals should be made illegal. Agree or disagree?;Perhaps the most serious problem facing the animals' rights today is animal experimentation. Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing, including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health, I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings.There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned. Firstly, the costs outweigh the benefits. Every year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result. Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money, since they must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances.Secondly, animals are kept in unnatural conditions. Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs. In March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head. Consequently, I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity.There is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals. Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading, since animals and people's response to a drug can be different. I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual.For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result and consequently, it should be made illegal.;The discussion surrounding the legality of animal testing has been highly controversial for years. I firmly believe that testing on animals should be prohibited. Utilizing animals for scientific research and product testing is a cruel and inhumane practice that raises significant ethical issues.To begin with, animal testing is frequently unnecessary and can yield unreliable results. There are numerous alternative methods available, including computer simulations and human clinical trials, that often provide more precise and relevant data. Additionally, animals may respond differently to substances than humans, which can lead to misleading or ineffective outcomes in treatment development.Furthermore, animal testing inflicts considerable suffering on innocent creatures. Each year, millions of animals endure painful and distressing procedures, such as toxicity assessments, skin and eye irritation tests, and lethal dose experiments. These animals are frequently kept under inhumane conditions, deprived of adequate food, water, and shelter, and are typically euthanized at the conclusion of the testing process.Moreover, there are various successful alternatives to animal testing already in practice. For example, numerous cosmetics companies have transitioned to in vitro testing methods that utilize human skin cells in laboratories to assess the safety and efficacy of their products. Similarly, many pharmaceutical companies are now employing computer simulations and human clinical trials to test new medications, rather than relying on animal models.In summary, testing on animals is an outdated, cruel, and unnecessary practice that ought to be banned. With the emergence of viable alternatives, there is no longer justification for subjecting animals to painful and distressing experiments. We have a moral responsibility to treat animals with dignity and compassion, safeguarding them from harm and exploitation.
111;"Many people believe that formal ""pen and paper"" examinations are not the best method of assessing educational achievement. What is your view of examinations?Ê";"Examinations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world. At virtually every stage of the learning process, exams are used to verify that the learner is ready to move on to the next stage. However, many believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered.There are clearly advantages to exams. They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates. They are also relatively versatile; different types of exam questions, for example, multiple-choice questions and essay tasks, can test different sorts of reasoning ability. However, exams also have some drawbacks. Test-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills. In contrast, some test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety. In this case, teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested, thus narrowing the educational experience for all.A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns. Wherever possible, exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment. Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills. Other types of assessment should also be considered, assignment writing, for example, to assess independent learning and research skills, or group projects, to measure teamwork ability.In conclusion, it is convincing that exams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement. However, exams need to be carefully designed and supplemented with other forms of evaluation if they are to be a truly useful component of the education system.";"The debate over the effectiveness of traditional ""pen and paper"" examinations as a measure of educational achievement has been ongoing for quite some time. While some argue that exams are a necessary part of education, others contend that they are inadequate for true evaluation. In my opinion, the conventional examination system has various shortcomings that render it an outdated and ineffective means of assessing students' knowledge and abilities.A primary criticism of examinations is that they tend to assess a student's capacity to memorize and regurgitate information rather than their comprehension and practical application of that knowledge. This emphasis on rote memorization often detracts from fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Additionally, the pressure associated with exams can cause significant stress and anxiety, adversely affecting students’ performance and overall well-being.Moreover, examinations tend to overlook the individual differences in students' learning styles and capabilities. While some learners may thrive in a standard exam format, others may struggle despite having a profound understanding of the subject. Furthermore, exams usually prioritize theoretical knowledge over practical skills, making it challenging for students to translate their learning into real-life applications.In summary, although exams have been an integral part of the education system for centuries, they are not the most effective way to assess academic achievement. They favor memorization over comprehension, generate unnecessary stress, and fail to accommodate varying learning styles. It is essential to explore alternative assessment methods, such as project-based evaluations and competency-based assessments, which could offer a more thorough and effective means of evaluating student progress. By moving away from traditional examinations, we can foster a more inclusive and supportive educational environment that enables students to realize their full potential."
112;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. However, the governments of richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in such areas.;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries.Firstly, in the area of health, poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations. High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident. On top of that, poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients. To solve these issues, richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals.Secondly, in the area of education, it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions. Besides that, education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it. In order to solve the education manpower problem, richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries. Meanwhile, for the issue of education fee, richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students.Lastly, in the area of trade, no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money. Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure. For example, residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production. As a token of goodwill, richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading. The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading.In conclusion, richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health, education and trade. Improvements in these areas will create a better life for residents in poorer nations which they can use to grow their homeland.;The development of less affluent nations is an urgent issue that demands a comprehensive strategy. Enhancements in health, education, and trade are vital for the growth and success of these countries. However, it is essential for the governments of wealthier nations to play a more active role in assisting their less fortunate counterparts in these areas.Health and education form the bedrock of a nation's progress. In poorer countries, these sectors often suffer from inadequate funding and staffing, resulting in limited access to essential healthcare and quality education. Wealthier nations can make a significant difference by offering financial support, donating medical supplies and equipment, and dispatching medical professionals and educators to share their knowledge. This not only enhances health and education outcomes in less affluent nations but also contributes to the development of a skilled and productive workforce.Trade represents another crucial area where wealthier nations can provide assistance. By lowering trade barriers and offering preferential market access, wealthier countries can help poorer nations boost their exports and stimulate economic growth. Furthermore, they can share their expertise and technology to support the development of infrastructure and industries in poorer nations. This can involve investments in transportation systems, communication networks, and energy production—all of which are essential for economic advancement.In summary, the development of poorer nations requires a united effort from the global community. The governments of wealthier nations have a moral responsibility to assist their less fortunate counterparts in improving health, education, and trade. By providing financial and technical support, wealthier nations can help break the cycle of poverty and foster sustainable development. It is crucial for them to adopt a more proactive approach to aid, not only as a moral obligation but also as a wise investment in global stability and prosperity. By collaborating, we can work towards creating a fairer and more prosperous world for all nations.
113;As computers are being used more and more in education, there will be soon no role for teachers in the classroom. Agree or disagree.;In recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process. However, I do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers.There are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers. Firstly, computers need to be operated by people. No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today. For example, lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector. However, scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching. I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers, but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch.Secondly, children need human interactions. No matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils. As a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education. Without someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn'. I am inclined to agree with this scientific view, because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model.In conclusion, there can be no school without a teacher. I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place. Teachers are not just teachers, they are also friends and conseilieurs.;"The growing integration of computers in education has ignited a discussion about the future of teachers in classrooms. While some believe that computers may one day take over the role of educators, I firmly disagree. Although computers serve as valuable tools to enhance learning, they cannot replicate the human connection and interpersonal skills that teachers offer.Computers can grant students access to a wealth of information and educational materials, yet they fall short of delivering the guidance, support, and personalized feedback that teachers provide. Educators are essential in helping students grasp intricate concepts, respond to inquiries, and deliver tailored attention. They also nurture key life skills such as communication, collaboration, and problem-solving, which are vital for success in today's world.Moreover, teaching extends beyond simply conveying knowledge; it involves inspiring, motivating, and mentoring students. Teachers are adept at fostering a supportive and inclusive learning atmosphere, which is crucial for students' emotional and social growth. In contrast, computers are limited in their capacity to offer emotional support and empathy—qualities that are fundamental to students' well-being and academic achievement.In summary, while computers will undoubtedly continue to play a significant role in education, they will not replace teachers in the classroom. Educators bring a distinctive combination of skills, experience, and human qualities that are essential for delivering quality education. Rather than substituting teachers, computers will enhance their contributions, enabling them to concentrate on their strengths: offering personalized support, guidance, and inspiration to students. Ultimately, the effective integration of computers into the educational landscape will improve the teaching process without rendering teachers obsolete."
114;Food can be produced cheaper if we use improved fertilisers and better machinery. However some of methods may be dangerous for human health, and have negative effects for local communities. What is your opinion?;In recent years, the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy. While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products, others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people's health condition and the society.Admittedly, applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers' economic profit. This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops, and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest. Consequently, the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased.However, high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals' health well-being. Unlike the organic plant foods, industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals, which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently. In this case, consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future.Moreover, excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society. One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission. In contrast, manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages. For another, mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry, possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields.In conclusion, even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers, it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked.;The adoption of advanced fertilizers and modern machinery in agriculture has led to a discussion about the balance between cost savings and potential threats to human health and local communities. On one side, utilizing contemporary farming methods can greatly lower production costs, resulting in food that is more affordable and accessible for a larger segment of the population. This is especially advantageous for low-income families and those facing financial challenges.Conversely, certain fertilizers and machinery pose risks to human health and the environment. For example, some fertilizers contain harmful chemicals that can contaminate soil, water, and air, leading to respiratory issues and other health problems. Additionally, intensive farming practices that depend on heavy machinery can cause soil erosion, water pollution, and a decline in biodiversity. Local communities might also suffer, as the increased mechanization can result in job losses and the displacement of small farmers.In my view, while improved fertilizers and machinery can indeed lower food production costs, the potential health and environmental dangers are not justifiable. I advocate for a greater emphasis on sustainable and organic farming practices, even if they come at a higher price. Although these methods may demand more labor and resources, they ensure that food is produced in a safe manner that honors the environment. Moreover, supporting local and small-scale farmers can help sustain the social and economic stability of rural areas. Ultimately, the real cost of food production should reflect not only the financial aspects but also the environmental and social implications.
115;Some people think that government should spend money on other important subjects rather helping artists. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country, every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely. Therefore, there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists, but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space. In my view, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons.The main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists. For example, monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists. In fact, some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue, thus, the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry.In addition, sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation. Therefore, culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art. Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts.Another reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted. Indeed, not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts. Hence, this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature.To sum up, art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere, so I think governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work.;"The idea that the government should prioritize funding for essential services over support for the arts has generated a lively debate. While some contend that national resources should focus on crucial public services and infrastructure, I strongly oppose this viewpoint.Art is an integral part of a nation's cultural and historical identity. Artists contribute significantly to preserving and promoting a country's heritage, enhancing the social fabric of society. By investing in the arts, the government fosters the nation's cultural capital, yielding long-term benefits that far surpass mere financial considerations. This investment nurtures a sense of community and national pride, both of which are vital for societal well-being and cohesion.Furthermore, the arts sector plays a crucial role in the economy. It creates job opportunities not only for artists but also for numerous professionals involved in art production, exhibition, and sales. A vibrant arts scene can also enhance tourism, drawing visitors eager to experience the unique cultural offerings of a country, which subsequently generates substantial revenue for local businesses and the government through tourism-related activities.It's important to note that the funds allocated to support artists typically represent only a small fraction of the government's overall budget. In comparison to spending on defense, healthcare, and education, the share dedicated to the arts is minimal. Thus, the claim that arts funding detracts from more critical sectors lacks substantial validity, as its impact on the overall budget is relatively insignificant.In summary, while it is reasonable for some to prioritize other public expenditures over arts funding, I believe that supporting artists is a crucial investment in a nation's cultural, economic, and social advancement. This issue is not a matter of choosing one over the other; rather, it is about achieving a balanced distribution of resources that acknowledges the essential role of art in enriching and defining society."
116;Development in technology causes environmental problems. Some people believe the solution in these problems is everyone accepts a simpler way of life, while others say that technology can solve these problems. Discuss both view and give your own opinion.Ê;It is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems. Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems. In the following paragraphs, I intend to discuss both viewpoints.Some people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment. They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment. If people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment.On the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment. They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back. We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart.There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot. One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa. By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030. By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions. If successful, the impact on the world would be monumental. It would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes. It would mean another industrial revolution.To put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, technology alone can solve the world's environmental problems. We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place. It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life.;The advancement of technology has undeniably resulted in a range of environmental issues, such as pollution, climate change, and the depletion of natural resources. In light of these challenges, two contrasting viewpoints have emerged. On one side, some advocate for a return to simpler living as a way to alleviate these environmental concerns. They propose that by embracing more modest lifestyles, minimizing consumption, and reducing reliance on technology, we can substantially lessen our ecological footprint. This perspective highlights the importance of making intentional choices in daily life, including utilizing public transportation, recycling, and conserving energy.Conversely, others contend that technology itself offers solutions to the very environmental problems it has caused. Supporters of this viewpoint argue that technological advancements can deliver innovative and effective remedies for environmental challenges. For example, renewable energy sources, green technologies, and sustainable manufacturing practices can help mitigate the harmful effects of human activities on the environment. Additionally, technology can enhance the monitoring and management of environmental resources, leading to improved conservation and preservation efforts.In my view, while adopting a simpler lifestyle can certainly play a role in tackling environmental issues, the potential of technology to address these problems should not be overlooked. Technology possesses the ability to foster meaningful positive change, and its ongoing evolution can promote more sustainable and eco-friendly practices. However, it is essential that the pursuit of technological advancements incorporates environmental considerations, ensuring that solutions prioritize sustainability. Ultimately, a balanced approach that blends the advantages of technology with conscious, environmentally-friendly lifestyle choices is likely the most effective strategy for confronting the environmental challenges posed by technological progress.
117;Professional athletes (such as football stars) and entertainers (such as singers and actors) are paid too much money for the work they do. Use specific details and examples to support your answer. ;Some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year. However, that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society. I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social, economic fields.First of all, some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own. For example, hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship. They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training, let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves. In addition, although there are many singers and athletes, few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately. Overcoming all these obstacles, they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts. However, their talents should not be overrated. Other people say that singers and athletes, in fact, contribute insignificantly to the development of the society. It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms. While scientists invent machines serving daily lives, doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation, singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life. They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience. Indeed, their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists, albeit necessary. Hence, their privilege of salary seems groundless, while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities.From all analysis suggested above, professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions. I think that there should be a modification in the salary of professional singers and athletes to balance with those of people in other fields, namely science and society, who are the driving forces for the prosperity of the nation.;The discussion regarding the compensation of professional athletes and entertainers has been ongoing for quite some time. Personally, I believe that these individuals are indeed overcompensated for their work. The earnings of elite football players, like Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, are astonishing, with some making upwards of $100 million annually. Similarly, A-list actors and musicians, such as Dwayne Johnson and Taylor Swift, often receive paychecks as high as $50 million per film or album.A common argument against these exorbitant salaries is that they are not reflective of the value these individuals provide to society. While athletes and entertainers do bring joy and entertainment to countless people, their roles are not as critical as those of doctors, teachers, or social workers, who frequently face underpayment and overwhelming workloads. For instance, the average annual salary for a teacher in the United States hovers around $60,000, a mere fraction of what many athletes and entertainers earn for a single performance or game.Moreover, the inflated salaries of professional athletes and entertainers can lead to negative outcomes, such as rising living costs and exacerbating income inequality. The funds that end up in these celebrities' hands could be more effectively allocated towards addressing urgent social challenges like education, healthcare, and poverty alleviation. Additionally, the focus on wealth and fame can set unrealistic standards, fostering a culture of excess and self-absorption.In summary, while professional athletes and entertainers do contribute to society, their remuneration is excessive and not commensurate with that contribution. It is time to reassess our values and strive for a fairer distribution of wealth—one that acknowledges and rewards the vital efforts of all professions, not just the most visible ones.
118;Some people think that computers and the Internet are more important for a child's education than going to school. But others believe that schools and teachers are essential for children to learn effectively. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;With the number of technological advances growing apace, it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future. This idea may point out to two main directions, both of which present different arguments.Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information, which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate. Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge, ranging from visual to aural stimuli, which make learning an ever enjoyable experience, especially for children.On the other hand, critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable, there still remain certain shortcomings. Much information as the Internet may provide, most of the sources are unjustified by experts. As a result, information from those sources is subject to question. Admittedly, the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can. Through face-to-face communication, teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore, adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students. This is where the computer proves to be incompetent.In short, although both sides have their equally valid arguments, I am inclined to think that although Internet can be a useful tool for education, at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced.;The discussion over the significance of computers and the Internet in comparison to traditional schooling in a child's education has ignited considerable debate. On one side, proponents assert that computers and the Internet are essential educational tools, offering unmatched access to a wealth of information and resources. With online platforms, children can learn at their own pace, explore educational materials globally, and experience interactive learning opportunities that may surpass conventional teaching methods.Conversely, some believe that schools and teachers play a vital role in effective learning. They argue that educational institutions provide a structured environment, opportunities for social interaction, and the guidance of skilled educators, all of which are critical for a child's cognitive, intellectual, and emotional growth. Teachers can customize their approaches to suit individual student needs, provide immediate feedback, and help children cultivate essential life skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving.In my view, the best approach to a child's education is one that balances the use of technology with traditional schooling. While digital tools offer access to extensive information and innovative learning experiences, the importance of teachers and the social dynamics of school life cannot be overlooked. Schools give children the chance to interact with their peers, develop social skills, and receive the necessary guidance for comprehensive development. Thus, I advocate for viewing computers and the Internet as supplementary resources that enhance the educational journey rather than substitutes for traditional schooling. By integrating the advantages of both, we can provide children with a well-rounded and effective education that equips them for success in today's world.
119;Capital punishment (the death penalty) is necessary in order to control the amount of violent crimes in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries. In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred, it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence. However, as the society grows, human rights become more highly respected, ""murdering"" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept.First of all, it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life. Although what criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, they are humans and their lives need to be valued. In addition, execution does not resolve the consequences of crime, not to mention it could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled.Secondly, capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives. Moreover, in terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away.The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted. Juries are also humans, they may lack of discretion. Thus, many people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system.In conclusion, although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community, I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane. Furthermore, it can be replaced by a life sentence.";The discussion around capital punishment, commonly referred to as the death penalty, has been a deeply divisive topic for many centuries. While some contend that it is essential for deterring violent crime, I hold a differing view. I find the argument that capital punishment effectively deters such crimes to be questionable.On one side, capital punishment can act as a significant deterrent for potential criminals, as the possibility of facing death may serve as a compelling warning. Furthermore, it can offer a sense of justice and closure to victims' families. In certain nations, the death penalty is designated for the most egregious offenses, such as murder or treason, and its enforcement may contribute to maintaining societal order.Conversely, evidence suggests that capital punishment does not reliably lead to reductions in violent crime. In fact, numerous countries that have abolished the death penalty have experienced declines in crime rates. This indicates that factors like socioeconomic status, education, and effective law enforcement are likely more influential in shaping crime trends. Additionally, the implementation of the death penalty can be inconsistent and biased, resulting in wrongful convictions and executions.In summary, while capital punishment might have some deterrent potential, I do not see it as a necessary tool for combating violent crime in society. I believe that a more effective strategy would involve addressing the underlying causes of crime, such as poverty, inadequate education, and social inequality. By focusing on education, job creation, and welfare initiatives, we can foster a safer and fairer society, reducing the need for capital punishment. Ultimately, addressing crime requires a more nuanced and comprehensive approach rather than an overreliance on the death penalty.
120;Businesses should do anything they can to make a profit. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;There is no doubt that companies, factories and businesses establish to provide products which are people's need and make a profit for their managers. However, I completely disagree with the idea that businesses should be allowed to do anything they want to make a profit. With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit.Firstly, if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want, they will threaten the beings' life such as human, animals and plants. As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances.Moreover, if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit, they will produce products with low qualities and high prices, therefore they might hit consumer's life. For instance, a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk, sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die.In conclusion, all companies, factories and businesses should be monitored by governments and executive, and they do not have to let do anything they want just due to making profit. They can hit both the environment and human's life easily.;The idea that businesses should do whatever it takes to achieve profits is a contentious issue. Although many companies aim to maximize their profits, I firmly believe that the approach should not be to compromise ethics in the process.A relentless focus on profit can lead to unethical and damaging practices that adversely affect society and the environment. For example, companies may prioritize reducing costs at the expense of employee well-being, resulting in unsafe working conditions and inadequate pay. Additionally, some companies might resort to environmentally harmful practices like pollution and deforestation to cut expenses and increase profits. Such choices not only harm the environment but also tarnish the company’s image and jeopardize its long-term viability.Moreover, an excessive emphasis on profit can result in the exploitation of consumers. Businesses may mislead customers through deceptive marketing or offer products that could harm their health. This erosion of trust can trigger regulatory repercussions and ultimately hurt the company's financial performance. On the other hand, businesses that embrace social responsibility and uphold ethical standards tend to foster greater customer loyalty, enhance their brand reputation, and achieve sustainable success.In summary, while profitability is crucial for businesses, it should not be prioritized at the expense of ethics, social responsibility, and environmental care. Companies ought to seek a balance between profit pursuit and responsible practices that benefit both the organization and society. By doing so, they can secure lasting success, uphold a strong reputation, and promote the well-being of their customers, employees, and the planet.
121;It is recently announced that a new high school may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan?;Although some of my neighbors will oppose this idea, personally I approve it. The new high school will bring a lot of advantages to my community. The high school of my district is pretty old and lacks in necessities for students, so they can't get enough education. I really believe that new high school is a great addition to the educational system of my community.	Firstly, I think that the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education. Their old high school is pretty old and need in new educational materials, repairing of the place for sport activities. Also the laboratory of physics and chemistry was in bad condition, so the students can't study well during the classes. They will study with new breath and great enthusiasm in new school. Secondly, the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city. After classes students and not only the students will get together in building of high school, participate in different competitions. For instance during the football match the students of different high schools will come and after the competition they will keep in touch. This will increase the social connections of the students. The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions. The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed, but I think this isn't a important reason for ceasing the competitions. To sum up, this new construction has a lot of advantages like new connections between students from different communities, also the new educational equipment will increase the students' enthusiasm toward studying. The only disadvantage is the nosiness of competitions which students will participate, but I think that it isn't a big deal. So the new high school will be a great addition for my environment.;The recent proposal for a new high school in our community has evoked a range of emotions among local residents. As a community member, I am inclined to back this initiative. Establishing a new high school would not only offer a modern learning environment for students but would also benefit the surrounding neighborhood.One of the primary advantages of a new high school would be its ability to address the current overcrowding in our existing schools. This would lead to improved educational outcomes, as smaller class sizes and enhanced resource availability would foster a better learning atmosphere. Additionally, the new facility would likely come equipped with state-of-the-art amenities, including modern technology, science laboratories, and sports facilities, further enriching the educational experience.In addition to educational benefits, a new high school would contribute positively to the local economy. The construction phase would generate job opportunities, and once operational, the school would attract businesses like cafes, bookstores, and other services geared towards students and staff. This influx would invigorate the local economy and support regional growth and development.Of course, I recognize that some residents may be concerned about potential increases in traffic and noise. However, I believe these challenges can be effectively managed through thoughtful planning and community engagement. By strategically selecting the school's design and location, we can minimize disruptions and implement measures to ensure that its operations have a minimal negative impact on the neighborhood.In summary, I wholeheartedly support the proposal to build a new high school in our area. The advantages, including enhanced educational opportunities, economic vitality, and community enhancement, far outweigh any potential concerns. With proper planning and consideration, I am confident that this new school will serve as an invaluable asset to our community, delivering quality education for pupils and improving the lives of local residents.
122;Parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their older (15 - 18 year old) teenaged children. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It might seem that teenaged children particularly in age of 15 - 18 are fully grown, so they do not need any help for making important decisions. However, in my opinion, teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages. I will discuss my view in two main areas.In the first place, there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children, therefore they are the best advisor for their children. They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life, so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things. Also, they can save value things in their life such as time and money, and enjoy they life with the best way.Moreover, I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers, because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money. They cheat young ages because they believe they are immature and they can trap them easily.To sum up, it makes no difference, people from young ages to old ages are free to make a decision, nonetheless sometimes to prevent some problems coming up for young individuals , it is a good idea to ask parents and adult relatives to give a piece of advice.;The notion that parents or adult relatives should make significant decisions for their older teenagers has ignited a passionate discussion. Some contend that adults should ultimately decide, while others advocate for granting teenagers greater independence. I personally stand against this viewpoint.Between the ages of 15 and 18, teenagers are undergoing a crucial developmental phase as they transition from childhood to adulthood. During this time, they cultivate their own beliefs, opinions, and values and begin to take responsibility for their lives. The process of making important decisions is vital for them, as it fosters essential skills like problem-solving, critical thinking, and decision-making.Additionally, teenagers often have a clearer understanding of their strengths, weaknesses, and interests compared to their parents. Their goals and aspirations may diverge from what their parents envision for them. Allowing teens to make their choices enables them to take ownership of their decisions, fostering a sense of accountability. This empowerment can lead to heightened motivation, self-confidence, and self-esteem.That said, parents and adult relatives can still play a vital supportive role in this decision-making journey. They can offer valuable advice and guidance while allowing teenagers to reach their own conclusions. This balanced approach aids in the development of decision-making skills while ensuring that teens make informed and responsible choices.In summary, I strongly believe that older teenagers should have the freedom to make significant decisions for themselves. This autonomy helps them cultivate essential life skills, embrace their choices, and become more confident individuals. While parental guidance remains crucial, it should serve to support and advise rather than control the decision-making process.
123;Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;You hardly ever can find a person who says that he or she had unpleasant childhood. When individuals reminisce their memories they absolutely infer to some of their childhood events. As much as their events might were bitter, in their adulthood they are sweet. In my opinion, childhood is definitely the happiest time of people life in two main areas.In the first place, children are free whatever they want to do, they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare. Because they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs. Therefore there is no argument and punishment for them.In addition, in this age they are not expected to be responsible. Also, they do not have to educate and they do not have to work, so they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life. As a matter of fact, I made a large number of friends in this age, and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten. Also I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age.All in all, I would maintain that the best phase of people life is their childhood. They not only free to do whatever they want without any confine or punishment, but also they are free and have a lot of time in their hands to try and experience new things and enjoy them.;The idea that childhood represents the happiest period in a person's life is a topic of much discussion. Some people support this view, while others disagree. Personally, I hold a partially affirmative stance on this matter. Childhood is indeed a time characterized by carefree joy, where children are unaware of the complexities and pressures that come with adulthood. During this phase, they can explore, learn, and play without the weight of responsibilities, allowing them to experience genuine happiness and innocence.Furthermore, childhood is marked by discovery and amazement. Children are in a constant state of learning and encountering new experiences. The simplicity and curiosity of this stage enable them to find joy in the smallest things, such as playing with friends, diving into a beloved book, or receiving a modest gift. These moments significantly shape their young minds and create cherished memories that can bring joy well into adulthood.However, it is crucial to recognize that not all children enjoy a happy childhood. Some face significant challenges like poverty, abuse, or neglect, which can profoundly affect their well-being and sense of happiness. Additionally, as individuals mature, they often find new sources of joy in forming meaningful relationships, achieving personal aspirations, or pursuing their interests. Thus, while childhood can be a joyous time, it may not be the happiest period for everyone.In conclusion, although childhood is undeniably a special and joyful time, it is not the sole period of happiness in a person's life. Happiness can manifest at various stages, shaped by unique experiences and circumstances. Nonetheless, the carefree and simple nature of childhood makes it a distinctive and happy phase that many people reminisce about fondly.
124;People attend college and university for many reasons. Why do you think people attend college and university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your idea.;From many centuries ago, universities have been playing an important role in ones' life. Different people attend university for different point of views. In my perspective, the three most reasons are increased knowledge, career preparation and new experiences.First of all, for most people, university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding. Truthfully, in this wonderful academic environment, everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers. Thus, people are able to strengthen their knowledge. Moreover, through the instructions of teachers, the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory, library, students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect. Therefore, they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying.Secondly, studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life, which included many new experiences. The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous, more than any school one person have studied. Thus, students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation, even from the whole world. For instance, my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, etc. And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment, which is one of his main purposes when attending university. Last but not least, preparing for career is an essential function of university. Students not only do homework, assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work, internship and part time job. Thus, they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are. After all, they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives.In summation, people may attend university for various reasons. Some want to enjoy new experiences, some are going to prepare for their future career, while others are eager to develop their understanding. Even though the purposes could be various, everybody who is studying in university should concentrate on the objectives and try their best.;Individuals choose to attend college and university for a variety of reasons, with each person driven by their unique motivations. In my view, the most significant reason for pursuing higher education is to gain advanced knowledge and skills in a specific area, ultimately improving career prospects. For example, many students seek higher education to obtain specialized training and expertise that is difficult to acquire through other avenues. This is especially relevant in sectors like medicine, engineering, and law, where obtaining a degree is often essential for entering the profession.Another major factor that motivates people to enroll in college and university is the potential for increased earning power. Research consistently demonstrates that individuals with a university degree tend to earn significantly more than those without one. In the United States, for instance, individuals holding a bachelor's degree typically earn around 60% more than those with just a high school diploma. This financial incentive serves as a compelling reason for many students to pursue further education.Beyond career advancement and financial rewards, numerous individuals attend college and university to expand their intellectual and social experiences. These institutions offer a wide array of courses, seminars, and workshops that enable students to discover new passions, hone critical thinking abilities, and connect with people from diverse backgrounds. Such experiences can lead to personal growth, creativity, and independence, ultimately helping students become more confident and well-rounded. In summary, the motivations for attending college and university are varied and complex, encompassing professional goals, financial aspirations, and personal development. By pursuing higher education, individuals can pave the way for success in both their careers and personal lives.
125;Do you agree or disagree? It's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.;There is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance. However, I still agree that it's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.We can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant. First, it's not easy to make friend with anyone. I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other. After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities, for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways. Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances. We spend time together but we could never be friend. So, it's much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends.Second, close friends can easily understand each others feelings. Because of the similarity I talked before, acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends. Moreover, they wouldn't even spare time to consider your feelings. Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time. Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend. When my friend is sick, I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible. If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail, I will try my best to pull him back, but not stand and stare like it's not of my business. And I believe my friend will do the same to me. In conclusion, a friend is a person you care about. To me, friends are the most important people in my life second to my family. I am the kind of person who has only one or two close friends, and I am fully content that I have such nice friends. If someone exchange my friends with thousands of acquaintances, I will definitely say NO.;"The debate over whether it's preferable to have one or two close friends rather than a multitude of casual acquaintances has generated considerable discussion. Some individuals argue that numerous acquaintances can foster a sense of belonging and social connectivity; however, I am convinced that having a small circle of close friends is far more advantageous.Close friendships offer a profound emotional bond and support system. With just a few trusted friends, one can develop meaningful relationships characterized by trust, empathy, and shared experiences. These connections often lead to greater satisfaction and fulfillment, providing a safe space to express thoughts, feelings, and experiences without the fear of judgment. In contrast, a larger network of casual acquaintances may create a superficial sense of connection, lacking the intimacy and depth that close friendships can provide.Furthermore, juggling numerous casual relationships can be emotionally taxing and may result in feelings of loneliness. The pressure to constantly interact with many acquaintances can be exhausting, as it often requires maintaining a social facade. Conversely, cultivating a few close friendships allows for more quality time and attention to each relationship, resulting in a more balanced and healthy social life.In summary, although a wide array of casual acquaintances may offer some social connection, I believe that having one or two close friends is infinitely more beneficial. The depth, intimacy, and emotional support that such friendships provide are crucial for our emotional and mental well-being. In an era where social media often muddles the distinction between genuine relationships and casual connections, prioritizing and nurturing close, meaningful friendships has become more vital than ever."
126;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"The life today is totally different from half centuries before. Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems; however it also deprives of some things that we had. In my opinion, life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons.The first reason is life is simple in the past. Nowadays, all humans compete together. Since world population getting higher, competition is getting fierce. If you are not able to handle your jobs, then someone will replace you right away. People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition. Therefore, lives in the old days is easier than today.Second, the environment today is serious damaged. Looking out the windows, what I see isn't sky, trees or mountains, but is coldly high buildings. Everyday, I walk on hard roads, breath in polluted air, and live in a limited space. What's worse, it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases. Thus, the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today.The third reason is that the pace of life. Today, we are able to read the news all over the world, to chat with people through the Internet, or to travel around the world by planes; however, it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life. If we cannot react properly and immediately, then we will be in a vulnerable situation. We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace.In conclusion, while there some people live in a pretty good condition, it is only a minority. People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology; nevertheless, behind the glamorous facade of it, what we loss will never be returned.";I wholeheartedly agree that modern life is easier and more comfortable than it was during our grandparents' childhoods. There are many reasons that bolster this view, and I will emphasize a few key points. Firstly, technological advancements have greatly enhanced our quality of life. The introduction of household appliances, improved transportation, and advanced communication devices has made everyday tasks far more efficient and less labor-intensive. For example, our grandparents had to wash clothes by hand, prepare meals from scratch, and travel long distances, all of which consumed considerable time and energy. Today, we can accomplish these chores with ease, thanks to innovations like washing machines, microwaves, and cars.Additionally, healthcare has seen remarkable improvements. Medical breakthroughs and the availability of better healthcare facilities have led to increased life expectancy and decreased mortality rates. In the past, our grandparents were more vulnerable to illnesses and had limited access to medical care, making their lives much more difficult. Moreover, the rise of education and information accessibility has contributed to a more manageable lifestyle. The internet and various digital platforms allow us to acquire knowledge and develop new skills from the comfort of our homes. This has paved the way for opportunities in personal and professional development that were unavailable in earlier times.In summary, it is clear that life today is much easier and more comfortable than it was for our grandparents. Advancements in technology, healthcare, and education have significantly improved our quality of life. Although we face new challenges, the overall standard of living has risen, and we should recognize and appreciate the conveniences and comforts we often overlook.
127;High school should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Agree or disagree?;High school is the time when you decide your future career and particular field you want to concentrate and interested in. In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice, to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude.First of all, as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study. Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights. As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams.Next, students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades. Also, we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students. For example, when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other. Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit.Lastly, the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she/he has an aptitude. When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education. Furthermore, this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses.In conclusion, as a young women I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement so it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well. Having three reasons helps us to bring up students who are well-educated, with a bright and independent mind.;The discussion surrounding whether high schools should enable students to select their own courses has ignited significant debate. I firmly believe that high schools should grant students the freedom to pursue courses of their choice. This practice offers numerous advantages, such as heightened motivation and engagement, as students are more likely to be enthusiastic about subjects they have chosen independently. When students are empowered to select their courses, they are more likely to take responsibility for their learning, which can result in improved academic performance.Moreover, allowing students to make their own course selections can aid them in uncovering their passions and strengths, allowing them to make well-informed choices regarding their future careers. By granting students the autonomy to select courses that resonate with their interests, high schools can facilitate a more tailored and effective learning experience. Subsequently, this can lead to greater student satisfaction and lower dropout rates, as students become more invested in their education.In addition, permitting students to choose their own courses promotes academic freedom and independence. In conventional high school environments, students are frequently required to follow a strict curriculum, which can feel confining. By providing greater flexibility in course selection, high schools can inspire students to think critically and make educated decisions regarding their academic journeys. This approach can also help students develop essential life skills, such as decision-making and problem-solving, which are beneficial beyond the classroom.In summary, allowing high school students to choose their courses is vital for enhancing academic motivation, autonomy, and personalized learning. By empowering students to select their own courses, high schools can cultivate a more engaging and effective educational atmosphere, positively influencing both academic and personal growth. Therefore, I strongly advocate for the practice of allowing students to study the subjects they wish to pursue.
128;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks, while others seem to prefer the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to live in a higher pace condition. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks, and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam. I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test. Therefore, we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy. If I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully. For instance, I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing. Hence, from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy. In contrast, it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I prefer to live in high pace. It is not to say, of course that other points of view are totally without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible.";The ongoing discussion about the merits of a fast-paced versus a slow-paced lifestyle has persisted for centuries. While some people flourish in a rapid environment, I strongly advocate for embracing a slower pace, as I believe it leads to a more meaningful and enjoyable life experience.To begin with, living at a slower pace allows individuals to truly appreciate the beauty around them. When we rush from one commitment to the next, we often miss the intricate details that enrich life. For example, taking a leisurely walk in a park on a sunny day can be a soothing experience, fostering a connection to nature and providing mental clarity. Conversely, hurrying through the same park robs us of that tranquil opportunity.Additionally, a slower approach can enhance productivity and efficiency in the long run. When we rush through tasks, mistakes are more likely, resulting in lower-quality work. In contrast, taking the time to carefully plan and execute a task can yield superior results. For instance, a chef in a hurry may produce a meal that is either burnt or lacking flavor, while a chef who takes their time can craft a culinary masterpiece.In summary, although some may prefer the hustle and bustle of a fast-paced lifestyle, I believe that adopting a slower pace is essential for a more fulfilling and successful life. By taking the time to enjoy our surroundings and approach our tasks with care, we can lead a life that is more purposeful and enjoyable. Ultimately, slowing down allows us to fully experience and savor every moment, transforming life into a more treasured and valuable journey.
129;Tourism is a multibillion-dollar industry that supports economic development. However, some people think that it causes too much damage to the local environment and culture. What do you think?;Tourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy. Nevertheless, some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction, as a result of tourist activities, and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems. While both positions seem reasonable, my view is that, through proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas.The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region. This takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry. The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs. Furthermore, tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry. This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes. As a result, this gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return.Some people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism. In fact, compared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers. For instance, paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution. On the other hand, the dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated. It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so.After careful consideration of both sides of the argument, the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages. In conclusion, it is evident that under suitable administration, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks.;The tourism sector has emerged as a vital driver of economic growth, generating billions in revenue annually. On one hand, it creates employment opportunities, boosts local economies, and fosters cultural exchange. Numerous countries rely heavily on tourism to sustain their economic health, helping lift many communities out of poverty. Moreover, tourism can encourage the preservation of cultural heritage sites and historical landmarks, as it prompts governments and local authorities to allocate resources for their upkeep and conservation.Conversely, the swift expansion of tourism has sparked concerns regarding its effects on local environments and cultures. The surge in visitors can result in pollution, degradation of natural habitats, and harm to ecosystems. Furthermore, tourism may lead to the commercialization of cultural practices, jeopardizing the authenticity and uniqueness of local traditions. The large influx of tourists can also strain local infrastructure, causing issues like overcrowding, traffic jams, and resource depletion.In my view, while tourism has the potential to be a powerful engine for economic development, it is essential to adopt sustainable practices that prioritize environmental protection and the preservation of cultural heritage. This can be accomplished through thoughtful tourism planning, strict regulation, and effective management. Governments and local authorities should collaborate to create strategies that harmonize economic growth with environmental and cultural conservation. By doing so, we can ensure that tourism continues to facilitate economic advancement while safeguarding the distinctive cultural and natural heritage of tourist destinations for future generations. With careful planning and management, tourism can indeed serve as a positive catalyst for economic, environmental, and cultural preservation.
130;The government should allocate more funds to public services instead of wasting money on arts such as music, painting and so on. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion;The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services, I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society.First of all, there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way. Admittedly, no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health, education, transportation and communication. However, these could only help individuals with their physical requirements. There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts.On top of this, the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society. No developed country could be named that music, painting, literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration. Enriching people's life and enlightening their thoughts, the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways.Furthermore, investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally. The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions. To sum up, not only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind, but also it would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways.;"The idea that the government ought to prioritize funding for public services over the arts has ignited a vigorous discussion. While some contend that increasing funding for public services is crucial, I strongly disagree. The arts are an essential facet of our cultural identity and should not be treated as a lower priority.To begin with, the arts significantly contribute to fostering creativity, driving innovation, and enhancing social cohesion. Various forms of artistic expression, such as music and painting, have the unique ability to unite people, break down barriers, and evoke deep emotions. By investing in the arts, the government can encourage cultural diversity, nurture local talent, and build a vibrant community that serves everyone.Furthermore, the arts sector plays a vital role in the economy. Research shows that the arts industry generates considerable revenue, supports a multitude of jobs, and stimulates local businesses. For example, music festivals and concerts can draw tourists, create job opportunities, and enhance local economies. Consequently, investing in the arts can have a positive ripple effect throughout the broader economic landscape.It's also crucial to recognize that public services and the arts are not in opposition; rather, they can enhance one another. Public art installations, for instance, can beautify and enrich public spaces, making them more welcoming and enjoyable for all. Additionally, arts programs in schools and community centers can impart valuable skills, foster education, and contribute to social welfare.In summary, while public services are undeniably important, the government should not dismiss the arts as a luxury. Instead, they should acknowledge the significant contributions that the arts make to our society, economy, and cultural landscape. A balanced approach that allocates resources to both public services and the arts is the most logical and beneficial course of action. By embracing this strategy, the government can promote comprehensive and inclusive development that enhances the lives of its citizens."
131;The idea of having a single career is becoming an old fashioned one. The new fashion will be to have several careers or ways of earning money and further education will be something that continues throughout life.;"The career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century. People usually tend to have a single career as a means of living. However, a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security.A full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family. But with the recent recession, almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall. This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers. As a result, people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition.Moreover, the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment. The official term of it is named ""Technological Unemployment"". North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that, technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one. For example, robots, automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks, interpreters, security services, retails and specially in manufacturing companies. Thus many people's jobs are now at high stake. The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs. Last but not least, corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors.For the reasons mentioned above, I believe that people are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves.";The conventional idea of maintaining a single, lifelong career is quickly becoming a relic of the past. In our fast-paced and ever-evolving world, the trend towards holding multiple careers or exploring various avenues for income is on the rise. This transformation is fueled by the necessity for individuals to remain adaptable, acquire new skills, and stay relevant in an increasingly competitive job market. Consequently, the principle of lifelong learning and continuous education is taking center stage.As technological advancements and automation reshape industries, many traditional roles are disappearing, while new opportunities are emerging. To ensure employability, individuals must embrace the idea of reskilling and upskilling, often engaging in several careers or income-generating activities. This may involve freelancing, starting a business, or taking on part-time roles alongside a primary occupation. For example, a software engineer might also serve as a part-time consultant or online educator, whereas a marketing professional may launch a side venture in e-commerce.Additionally, the growth of the gig economy and remote work options has opened doors for people to pursue varied income sources and flexible work arrangements. This newfound flexibility allows individuals to follow their passions, interests, and values rather than being confined to a single career trajectory. To successfully navigate this evolving landscape, continuous learning and education are crucial, enabling workers to stay informed about the latest trends, technologies, and in-demand skills.In summary, the idea of a singular career is becoming outdated. The future of work will necessitate multiple income streams, ongoing education, and a commitment to skill development. As the job market continues to transform, those who are adaptable, inquisitive, and dedicated to lifelong learning will be the most equipped to flourish in this new work era. By embracing these changes, we can uncover fresh opportunities, inspire innovation, and cultivate a more resilient and dynamic workforce.
132;Some people think that computers are more of a hindrance than a help in today's society. Others believe that they are such indispensable tools that they would not be able to live or work without them. Discuss both opinions and give your opinion;Computer is a modern device that is useful for human life. People use computer particularly for work, study, even for communication. However, many people argue that computer more give obstacle than a help in social life. Other sides believe that it becomes prominent thing, and they cannot do anything without that device. However, I strongly believe that computer can influence society, and people's lives have already been controlled by device. I would argue that this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people. A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to, due to the fact that they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working. As it can be seen from the example, the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected.However, using computer can make people easier to complete their work. Businessmen, for example, use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues. Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country. This is due to using computer more efficient and, many workers cannot do more in work without computer.In conclusion, in era technology like this age, computer becomes important thing in human life. Every day, people cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it. This situation becomes lifestyle habits, and nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use.;The rise of computers has fundamentally changed the way we live and work, igniting a lively debate over their societal effects. On one side, some argue that computers are more of a hindrance than a benefit. They suggest that our dependence on technology has led to a reduction in face-to-face communication, as many now favor interacting with screens over engaging with people. Additionally, the incessant flow of notifications and distractions from social media and email can hinder productivity and contribute to mental health challenges. Furthermore, the quick pace of technological advancement and the frequent need for upgrades can impose a considerable financial strain.Conversely, others contend that computers are essential tools that have vastly improved our lives and work processes. They provide access to vast information, facilitate global connections, and automate various tasks, enhancing efficiency and convenience. Computers have also opened new doors for entertainment, education, and creativity, empowering individuals to express themselves and acquire new skills. Moreover, they have allowed businesses to function more effectively, promoting global trade and commerce. In my view, computers are vital instruments that have significantly enriched society. While it's true that an over-dependence on technology can lead to negative outcomes, the advantages of computers far surpass their downsides. When used responsibly, computers can enhance our lives, boost productivity, and offer endless opportunities for personal and professional growth. Ultimately, it's up to individuals to engage with computers in ways that support rather than dominate their lives. By finding a balance between using technology and maintaining human interaction, we can fully harness the power of computers to enhance our lives and society as a whole.
133;Some employers are giving increased importance to social skills. However, others still believe qualifications are the most important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Ê;With the increased educational level of workforce, there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process. However, some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion. The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion. Firstly, some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer. It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job. Specifically, people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience. Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery. On the other hand, it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers. It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently. Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other, especially when conflicts arise. Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way. Besides, organization have been transformed to customers oriented. Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction.To my view, I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs. Yet, the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others.;The discussion regarding the significance of social skills compared to qualifications in the workplace has become increasingly prominent in recent years. Some employers are prioritizing social skills—like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving—believing that these abilities are crucial for effective collaboration and enhanced productivity in today’s work environment. This perspective gains traction from the fact that many positions involve teamwork, client interaction, and the need to adapt to changing circumstances, all of which rely heavily on strong social skills.Conversely, others contend that qualifications remain the most critical factor in hiring choices. They assert that a candidate’s educational background and relevant certifications serve as the best indicators of their job performance capabilities. This view is rooted in the belief that qualifications reflect an individual’s expertise and knowledge in a specific area, making them a dependable gauge of potential success in a role.In my view, while qualifications are undoubtedly important, social skills may be equally, if not more, crucial in today's workplace. In an ever-evolving and fast-paced business landscape, employees must be able to communicate effectively, collaborate efficiently, and think innovatively to foster growth and success. Additionally, social skills can be cultivated and enhanced over time, whereas qualifications are often more static. Therefore, I believe that employers should consider a candidate's qualifications alongside a thorough evaluation of their social skills—using methods such as interviews, group activities, or references. This approach enables them to hire individuals who not only possess the necessary knowledge and experience but also have the capability to collaborate effectively and contribute to the overall success of the business.
134;Some people believe that charities should give aid to those who need the aid most, wherever they live. Some people believe that charity organisations would better concentrate on people in their own countries instead. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;The world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters. Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people. However, it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located. My view is that international aid should be prioritised.International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems. Many people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards. They lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs. What is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members. It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support.Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders, it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens. After all, charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected. Another reason is that, even within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs. By solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth.In conclusion, people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary.;The ongoing debate about charity aid has ignited a heated discussion on whether organizations should prioritize global needs or concentrate on their domestic populations. Advocates for global assistance argue that charities ought to help those in dire circumstances, irrespective of their location. This standpoint is grounded in the notion that humanitarian crises—such as natural disasters, famines, and conflicts—demand swift and thorough aid. By extending support to those who are most vulnerable worldwide, charities can significantly reduce suffering and save numerous lives. For example, international organizations have been crucial in responding to urgent global challenges like the refugee crisis and pandemics, highlighting the necessity of a worldwide perspective in charitable efforts.Conversely, others contend that charitable organizations should primarily assist individuals within their own nations. This viewpoint suggests that there are always individuals domestically who can benefit from charity. By tackling local issues, charities can address often neglected or underfunded challenges such as homelessness, hunger, and access to education or healthcare. Additionally, local donations can enhance community spirit and stimulate volunteerism, thereby strengthening social ties and cultivating a culture of generosity.In my view, a balanced approach is the most effective strategy. Charities should take care of those in critical need on a global scale, particularly during acute crises, while also staying committed to addressing domestic challenges. This dual focus enables charities to respond to international emergencies while simultaneously supporting and improving local communities. Ultimately, the objective of charity is to alleviate suffering and enhance lives— a mission that extends across borders but also demands attention to local circumstances. By embracing a strategy that integrates both global outreach and local involvement, charities can optimize their impact and foster a more equitable and compassionate world.
135;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations, and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change. Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources, I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge.It is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students' acquisition of knowledge. Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields, and as the students answer these questions, the facts has been learned and reinforced. A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams, as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time. Moreover, when students have some academic problems, they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs. Besides, in the past, conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves, now all can be done at a click of a button. Thus, technologies are vital in students' learning.On the other hand, schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators. At schools, students' development has been orchestrated stage by stage, step by step by experienced teachers, and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way. Therefore, formal education approaches are also indispensable. To put it all in a nutshell, I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children's development. So students should learn both from their teachers as well as modern technology to gain the best learning outcome.;The idea that students gain more from lessons with teachers than through alternative resources has ignited a lively discussion. While some contend that traditional teaching methods are the most effective, I hold a nuanced view on this matter. I believe that students can derive substantial knowledge from both educators and various other sources, with the most successful learning often resulting from a blend of the two.On one hand, teachers are crucial in providing direction, support, and constructive feedback. They can customize their lessons to fit their students' needs, foster an interactive and captivating learning atmosphere, and assist in honing critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. Furthermore, teachers offer invaluable feedback on students' progress, which is key to enhancing their comprehension and performance.Conversely, alternative resources, such as the internet and television, also serve as important educational tools. The internet grants access to a wealth of educational materials, including online courses, instructional videos, and interactive learning formats. Students can utilize these resources to learn at their own pace, revisit concepts that were unclear in class, and delve deeper into subjects of interest. Additionally, documentaries and educational programs on television present a visual and engaging means of exploring various topics.In summary, while teachers are indispensable for providing guidance and support, resources like the internet and television also contribute significantly to the learning experience. I maintain that students can benefit effectively from a combination of traditional teaching methods alongside alternative sources, with the most successful learning strategies often incorporating both. By leveraging both teachers and various resources, students can achieve a more holistic understanding of the material and develop an array of skills that will serve them well throughout their lives.
136;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"A world sportive competition event is watched by almost every country around the world and provide social stimulus and people gathering. However, while people view these sportive events as vital in release international problems, others think that they are just entertainment to distract people. I believe that they are important somehow, but not essential.As a matter of fact, world sport events provide positive waves for number of people. The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team. These emotions are shared locally in our village or city, nationally in our own country but even internationally too. Obviously these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased. For example, the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun.Moreover, these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs. Thus, if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal, the reality is different. In other words, this is the ""calm before the storm"". After the Olympics games are finished, everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority. To picture it, recently, Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries, but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn't listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea.Finally, an international sports event is a very good thing to gather people, let them dream, being proud of their nationality and forget problems, but just for a while. These meetings are in none case here to interact with international affairs.";The assertion that major events such as the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions play a vital role in alleviating global tensions and channeling patriotic sentiments in a constructive way is a matter of contention. While some believe these events unite nations and create opportunities for friendly competition, I only partially concur with this view.On one side, international sporting events indeed provide a remarkable chance for countries to set aside their disagreements and engage in a collective experience. The football World Cup, for example, draws a vast global audience and cultivates a sense of unity among supporters from varied backgrounds. The enthusiasm and fervor inspired by such events can help alleviate international tensions, as individuals from different nations connect through their shared passion for sports. Additionally, these events offer a safe means for expressing patriotic feelings, allowing fans to demonstrate their national pride in a respectful and controlled setting.Conversely, these events can also fuel conflict and heighten nationalism. The fierce rivalry and competition they evoke may sometimes lead to confrontations among fans, exacerbating existing tensions between countries. For instance, the political and social strife between nations can manifest in the behavior of their supporters, potentially resulting in violence and unrest. Furthermore, the significant resources and attention devoted to these events can distract from more urgent global challenges, such as poverty, inequality, and environmental issues.In conclusion, while international sporting events like the football World Cup can indeed help ease global tensions and serve as a safe avenue for patriotic expression, their influence should not be overstated. They are not a cure-all for international conflicts, and their consequences can be intricate and varied. Nonetheless, when approached with a spirit of mutual respect and camaraderie, they can contribute to a more peaceful and harmonious world.
137;Many people use distance-learning programmes (study material post,TV,internet...)to study at home. But some people think that it cannot bring the benefit as much as attending college or university. Do you agree or disagree?;With the tremendous development in information technology, long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school. Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate. From my perspective, I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education.To begin with, studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense. Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection. This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line.Besides that, long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches. Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc. A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course.It is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations. These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities. But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts.In conclusion, I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future. However, distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose.;The emergence of distance-learning programs has transformed the landscape of education, enabling individuals to pursue their studies from the comfort of their homes. While some critics argue that these programs fall short compared to traditional colleges and universities, I respectfully disagree and assert that distance-learning can be just as effective as conventional education.One of the most significant benefits of distance-learning is its flexibility. Students have the freedom to set their own schedules, which allows them to juggle work, family commitments, and other responsibilities alongside their studies. This flexibility is particularly advantageous for those who face geographical or financial barriers that prevent them from attending traditional institutions. Moreover, distance-learning programs typically offer access to a vast array of courses and materials, which can be frequently updated to keep pace with the latest advancements in specific fields.Additionally, many distance-learning programs now integrate interactive features, including online discussions, video conferencing, and virtual labs, which can foster a sense of community and engagement akin to that found in conventional classrooms. Furthermore, the absence of distractions and peer pressure in a home setting can enable some students to concentrate better and enhance their learning experience.While it is accurate that distance-learning programs may offer fewer social interactions and hands-on experiences compared to traditional education, I believe these limitations can be addressed through thoughtful program design and strong student motivation. With the right attitude and support, students can acquire comparable knowledge and skills to those taught in traditional settings. In conclusion, I am convinced that distance-learning programs offer a multitude of advantages and serve as a viable alternative to conventional education.
138;There are many extinct species in the world nowadays. Some people say we should protect these animals from dying out, while others say we should concentrate more on problems of human beings. Discuss both opinions and give your personal view.;Many animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons. While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species, others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention. In my opinion, we should give priority to our own issues.Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem. If certain species are absent from this system, such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species, including human beings, will come under threat. Therefore, it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible.However, I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution. The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being. A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment. On most occasions, the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it.Furthermore, human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars. When these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help. We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species.In conclusion, more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals, and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction.;The rapid decline of various species has emerged as a critical issue in the contemporary world. Some advocate for prioritizing the conservation of endangered animals, while others argue that human issues should take precedence. In this essay, I will examine both viewpoints and share my own perspective.On one side, the conservation of endangered species is vital for sustaining the fragile equilibrium of our ecosystems. Animals are essential for maintaining the natural environment, and their disappearance can lead to significant repercussions, such as disrupting food chains and reducing biodiversity. Additionally, many species have unique traits that could offer valuable contributions to medical research, potentially leading to breakthroughs in treating human diseases. Consequently, it is imperative that we implement strategies to protect these species from extinction.Conversely, some contend that addressing human challenges should be our main focus. They argue that problems like poverty, hunger, and illness should take priority over animal protection efforts. This viewpoint is understandable, given the profound hardship faced by individuals worldwide. However, I respectfully disagree, as I believe that human health and well-being are closely intertwined with the condition of our planet. By safeguarding animal populations and their habitats, we ultimately ensure the long-term survival of humanity itself.In conclusion, while both perspectives present valid arguments, I strongly maintain that the conservation of endangered species is crucial for the health of our planet and, by extension, for humans. It is our duty to protect the natural world, and I believe conservation initiatives should be a top priority. By collaborating to safeguard endangered species, we can secure a sustainable future for all life forms, including ourselves.
139;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;In today's context, education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one's future. In my personal opinion, I am totally agreed with the view that there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses. There appear to be various reasons often strike in my mind in support of this position. To begin with, judging student's skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular. Nowadays, both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education. In India, for example, female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations. Furthermore, female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops, unlike previous generation females. In addition, due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments, female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace, despite its intensive stress and pressure. For example, Chanda Kochhar, who is the CEO of India's second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country's most powerful female head in business sector. In conclusion, I am firmly supporting the view, that every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects, provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender. Government should take interim measures, to regulate admission process for university courses which enables every student to get benefit.;The proposal that universities should enroll equal numbers of male and female students in every subject has ignited significant discussion. While the goal of fostering gender equality is admirable, I only partially support this idea.On one hand, achieving balanced representation in various fields can help close the disparities in areas where one gender is notably underrepresented. For example, fields like engineering and computer science, which have historically been male-dominated, have witnessed a considerable rise in female enrollment due to focused recruitment initiatives. This not only enhances diversity but also offers different viewpoints, enriching the overall educational experience.Conversely, implementing a rigid gender balance in all subjects could lead to undesirable outcomes. Such a policy might result in less qualified individuals being admitted over more qualified candidates solely to satisfy gender quotas, potentially undermining the institution's academic standards. Additionally, certain disciplines might naturally attract more students from one gender based on personal interests or future aspirations, and enforcing equal ratios could hinder the prospects of those who are genuinely passionate about their chosen field.In summary, while the aim of achieving equal male and female representation in every subject is well-meaning, a more thoughtful strategy is required. Universities should strive to create an inclusive atmosphere that motivates students of all genders to explore their interests without enforcing strict quotas. This approach can foster true diversity and equality, enabling students to excel in their fields without sacrificing academic quality. Ultimately, the focus should be on providing equal opportunities rather than enforcing equal numbers.
140;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Face-to-face communication is better than other types of communication, such as letters, email, or telephone calls. Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether face-to-face communication is better than other kinds of communication, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that communication in person is the best way of expression, while others seem to stand on the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I agree that face-to-face communication is better. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that communicating in person can be more convincing. Sometimes, face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully, and a fitting example can be found from my uncle. He once complained a service of a restaurant. Without exaggeration, he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it. Afterward, my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication. If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone, I do not think this problem would be thought important. Therefore, we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally crucible aspect is that it is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication. For instance, I had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend, Eric. He said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore. I just shocked and did not know what happened. Finally, I realized that his facebook account was stolen. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that communication by letters, email, or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple, which is also one of the most important parts in communication. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. It is conceivable that before we talk, it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words. Talking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication; in contrast, it is usually detrimental to us. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I prefer to express my opinion in person because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I think the best way of communication is by means of face-to-face. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";I firmly believe that face-to-face communication surpasses all other forms of interaction. Meeting in person creates a more intimate and engaging environment, fostering a deeper understanding and connection between individuals. When communicating face-to-face, nonverbal signals such as body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice effectively convey emotions and attitudes, offering insights that written or verbal communication alone may miss.Additionally, in-person communication enhances the clarity and efficiency of idea exchange. It allows for immediate feedback and the opportunity to ask questions or seek clarification, which greatly reduces the chances of misunderstandings. For example, during business meetings, in-person discussions facilitate negotiations, build trust, and strengthen relationships with clients and colleagues. It also plays a vital role in nurturing personal connections, enabling people to express emotions and empathy more authentically.Conversely, other communication methods—like letters, emails, or phone calls—often lack the personal touch and can lead to confusion. Emails and letters can be easily misinterpreted, and phone conversations may miss the visual cues that are crucial for effective dialogue. While technology has undeniably accelerated and simplified communication, it cannot replicate the significance of face-to-face interactions. In summary, face-to-face communication stands out as the most effective means of interaction, providing a more engaging, impactful, and personal experience essential for cultivating strong relationships and sharing ideas.
141;One of the consequences of improved medical care is that people are living longer and life expectancy is increasing. Do you think the disadvantages of this development outweight the disadvantages?;Along with the development of technologies, advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy. Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system, I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages.The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health. They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity. In other words, they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost.In addition, a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society. In facts, young people will be happy as their parents, grandparents are healthy. It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people.On the other hand, some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system. Although it is real in some aspects, I believe that the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time, so they are worth to have good care. They have given their effort to the society so that young people, the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system.By way of conclusion, it is true that the development of the health care system helps people have a better life. It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old.;Recent progress in medical care has significantly extended human lifespans, resulting in a notable increase in life expectancy. This development brings many advantages, such as allowing individuals to enjoy more time with family and contribute positively to society. However, it also presents several challenges. Nevertheless, I believe the benefits of this trend outweigh its downsides.On one hand, longer life expectancy places added pressure on pension and social security systems, requiring governments to extend financial support for much longer periods. Additionally, the rising elderly population can strain healthcare systems because older adults typically necessitate more medical attention. Furthermore, an aging workforce may lead to a shortage of skilled labor, as retiring workers are not always replaced by younger employees with equivalent expertise.Conversely, the advantages of increased life expectancy significantly surpass the negatives. People now have the opportunity to explore their passions and interests for more extended periods, resulting in a more rewarding life. Moreover, prolonged life spans facilitate the sharing of knowledge and experience across generations, with older individuals imparting their wisdom to younger counterparts. This exchange can drive meaningful societal progress and innovations.In summary, while the rise in life expectancy, a result of enhanced medical care, has its challenges, I strongly maintain that its advantages far overshadow the drawbacks. The positive impacts of longer and healthier lives—such as the ability to follow one's interests and educate future generations—mark this trend as a highly beneficial one. As medical advancements continue, it is likely that human lifespans will keep increasing, fostering a more innovative, productive, and fulfilling society.
142;Successful people do something new or take risks rather than only doing something they know how to do well. AGREE OR DISAGREE.;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether successful people usually take risk or try new things, and the topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that to be successful, they should do something they are unfamiliar with, while others seem to stand on the opposite place. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the latter; that is, successful people still do things they already know.The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that to be successful, we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter. The lower the factors making us fail we have, the higher probability to success we own. Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment. He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest, and then just waits for the not so high but constant income. He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time. Therefore, we can commence to agree that successful people do not have to try new things or take risks.Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not. At least, a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success. For instance, the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills. The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm. In contrast, those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is not necessary for successful people to take risks.Admittedly, on the other hands, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that doing something new is necessary for people to success because they can become different from others, which is also a widely accepted idea for success. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. Try something new can indeed make people become special, while it does not mean successful. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that doing what we already known can still leads us to succeed because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, reducing risks and enhancing individual's capability is the most important path to success. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";I believe that successful individuals frequently venture into uncharted territory and embrace risks instead of sticking solely to what they know well. This mindset is pivotal for attaining success, as it encourages people to leave their comfort zones, challenge themselves, and seek out new opportunities. By embracing risks and exploring new avenues, individuals can uncover hidden strengths, generate innovative ideas, and maintain an edge in their fields.Playing it safe and limiting oneself to familiar tasks can lead to stagnation and complacency. It's the readiness to take calculated risks and experiment with fresh approaches that allows individuals to grow, learn, and adjust to ever-changing circumstances. Numerous successful entrepreneurs, inventors, and leaders have reached their goals by welcoming uncertainty and pushing beyond the confines of their comfort zones.Moreover, engaging in new experiences or taking risks can enhance creativity, resilience, and problem-solving abilities. When faced with unfamiliar challenges, individuals must think critically, be resourceful, and devise creative solutions. These skills can be applied to various areas of life, resulting in greater overall success. In summary, successful people typically emphasize taking risks and pursuing new experiences over playing it safe. This strategy keeps them innovative, adaptable, and receptive to new challenges, ultimately fostering significant personal and professional growth. By embracing uncertainty and pushing their boundaries, individuals can tap into their full potential, achieve their aspirations, and make a meaningful impact in their fields. Thus, I strongly believe that taking risks and trying new things is an essential element of achieving success.
143;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;The purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society, especially in high level such as college or university. Some people think that all students should deserve to be educated at this level. However, in my opinion, it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners.First, focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality. Unlike middle school or high school, university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge. In fact, some students may be capable in high schools, but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones. That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people, and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions, since they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone.Secondly, university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes. Some people argue that this may lead to 'social division', when someone with high education refuses to do the called 'low jobs', but actually it gives no harm to the whole community. Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone, while complex ones should be only handled by the best people, who start their career from the best institutions. I think limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice since it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning, which makes them do the best to improve themselves. Ultimately, this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society.To sum thing up, I agree that everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school, but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students. This will improve the quality of both universities and students, thus placing people in positions which suit them most.;The debate over whether higher education should be accessible to all students or restricted to those with exceptional academic performance has ignited discussions among educators and policymakers. Some argue that higher education should be limited to high-achieving students who have shown academic excellence and diligence. They contend that this strategy ensures that only the most capable and driven individuals acquire the knowledge and skills needed for success in their fields.Conversely, others advocate for open access to higher education for all students, irrespective of their academic history or abilities. They assert that education is a fundamental right and that each individual should have the chance to pursue higher studies. This perspective not only fosters social mobility and equality but also cultivates a skilled workforce that can contribute to a nation's economic growth and progress.I align with the belief that higher education should be accessible to every student. Education is essential for both personal development and societal advancement, and denying access can have lasting repercussions for individuals and society at large. Furthermore, offering higher education opportunities can help identify and nurture talented individuals who may not have had the chance to showcase their capabilities earlier in their academic journeys. By ensuring that higher education is available to all, we can work towards a more inclusive and equitable society where everyone has the opportunity to realize their full potential.
144;Agree or disagree? Universities spend money on improving facilities (labs and general requirements) better than hiring famous teachers.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers, and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities, while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to spend money on improving facilities. The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have, the more chances we can increase our knowledge. For example, library is a good place for students to study or research. They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience; also, there are a lot of references for students to utilize. With this convenient and versatile facility, students can improve their learning condition. Therefore, we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students. Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms. They have numerous activities in school. Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school. He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance. With this distinguished performance, the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities.Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study. It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards. Based on the reasons demonstrate above, I believe that improving facilities is the best way for school because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other. In other words, students can procure more advantages from better facilities. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I an firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";The ongoing debate over whether universities should prioritize upgrading their facilities or hiring renowned professors has ignited considerable discussion. I believe that universities allocate their resources more wisely when they focus on enhancing their facilities rather than recruiting famous educators.To begin with, upgrading facilities, such as laboratories and libraries, gives students valuable hands-on experience and access to advanced technology. This not only helps them develop practical skills but also keeps them informed about the latest advancements in their respective fields. Well-designed facilities can draw in more students and significantly improve their overall educational experience. Additionally, modern facilities serve multiple generations of students, making them a worthwhile long-term investment in the university's infrastructure.Conversely, while hiring well-known teachers can enhance the institution's prestige and attract students, it doesn't always lead to improved learning outcomes. These renowned instructors may not always excel in teaching, and their substantial salaries can detract from funding that could be used in other crucial areas. Moreover, high faculty turnover rates at many universities can mean that the advantages of hiring a famous teacher may be short-lived.In conclusion, although bringing in distinguished teachers can enhance a university's reputation and draw in students, I strongly contend that investing in improved facilities is a more effective use of resources. By prioritizing state-of-the-art laboratories, libraries, and other infrastructure, universities can create an exceptional learning environment and equip students with the necessary skills for success in their fields. This strategy not only benefits current students but also future ones, making it a more sustainable and responsible allocation of university funds.
145;Do you agree or dis agree with the following statement? High schools should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Some people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to. They believe this motivates students to study. I think, however, students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics. I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university. In addition, it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles.To begin with, students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested. They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects, otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject. For instance, a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field.Next, students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields. General education plays a significant role in specialized education. Science today, for example, is said to be more and more specialized, but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics. In addition, although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects, in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects. For instance, you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry. Therefore, high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university.Last but not least, students have tendency to shun difficulties. They might avoid tough courses, but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much. This might result in limited choices in the future. Therefore, schools should be responsible for their future and protect them.In summary, students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education. Besides, high school must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum.;I firmly believe that high schools should permit students to select the courses they wish to study. This approach offers numerous academic and personal advantages for the students. Firstly, it enables them to explore their interests and passions, which can significantly boost their motivation and involvement in their studies. When students engage with subjects that truly captivate them, they are more likely to be driven to learn and achieve better grades.For example, a student with a strong interest in art may feel limited by a curriculum that focuses solely on core subjects like math and science. Allowing students to choose courses that reflect their interests can cultivate a lifelong love of learning that goes beyond the classroom. This autonomy also helps students identify their strengths and talents, potentially guiding them towards career paths they might not have considered before.Additionally, empowering students to select their own courses can better prepare them for real-world situations. In their future jobs, individuals are often expected to be autonomous and to make choices regarding their professional growth. By allowing students the freedom to choose their coursework, schools are effectively teaching them how to make informed decisions about their educational journey, a crucial skill in both academic and professional arenas.In summary, granting students the freedom to choose their courses can result in a more engaging, effective, and personalized educational experience. It fosters independence, nurtures their interests, and may lead to enhanced academic achievement and personal satisfaction. Therefore, high schools should certainly enable students to study the subjects they are passionate about, as this empowers them to take charge of their own learning and development.
146;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Games are as important for adults as they are for children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As people grow up, the arguments about the importance of games arise. Some people think that, adults need playing games as children do. However, in my opinion, games are no longer too important for them for several reasons.The first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin. Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life. But, more often, the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies, and as a result, they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago. For example, in my country, except for a minor part of professional athletes, the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job. They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives.Another reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity, while children are always keen on competition and winning. For youngsters, maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not. For example, my younger sister likes fencing, and thanks to her desire to win, she never gives up when facing a difficult situation, or even becoming hurt. On the other hand, adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately. In fact, a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues. Because of that, they no longer play games for any moderate achievements, and gradually lose their interest in such activities.To sum up, I think adults do need to play games, but their styles are often distinct from children's, which are often less competitive and more enjoyable. Along with the high requirement for family and work, games are just some leisure activities for adults, not something necessary as they are meant to be for children.;I wholeheartedly believe that games are just as vital for adults as they are for children. While it’s commonly recognized that games significantly contribute to children's cognitive and social development, their benefits reach far beyond early years. In reality, games can deeply influence the physical, mental, and emotional health of adults.One key reason why games matter for adults is that they offer a much-needed respite from the pressures of daily life. With busy schedules and high-stress environments, adults can find a healthy outlet for relaxation through gaming. For instance, puzzle games, strategy games, and sports games not only enhance cognitive abilities like problem-solving and decision-making but also help alleviate stress and anxiety. Additionally, multiplayer games create opportunities for social interaction, which is crucial for fostering mental well-being and fighting feelings of isolation.Moreover, games can also promote physical health among adults. Video games that involve physical activity—such as dance or exercise games—encourage adults to stay active and bolster their overall fitness. Furthermore, games can serve as effective tools for skill development and knowledge acquisition. For example, language-learning games, culinary games, and business simulations can assist adults in honing new skills and advancing their career opportunities.In summary, games hold equal significance for adults as they do for children. They provide numerous advantages, including stress reduction, cognitive enhancement, social connection, and physical activity. Therefore, adults should prioritize incorporating games into their lives, viewing them as more than just a child's pastime. By doing so, they can enjoy the myriad benefits that gaming offers and enhance their overall quality of life.
147;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Modern technology is creating a single world culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"There are many different opinions regarding world culture. Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture. However, in my view, a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons.Firstly, most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology. Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data, and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint. For example, students who are studying in Iran use the same software, Microsoft, to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students.Secondly, new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world. Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries, and students are being encouraged to study in this field. For example, many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries. This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries.Some people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture, and technology cannot affect them. This point has some merits on the surface; however, many countries such as Canada, the USA, and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures. In fact, cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet. For example, two days ago, I went to a Canadian restaurant, and I ate noodle, sushi, which are Chinese foods, and Greek salad.To sum up, new technology has affected cultures of the world, and we can see many similarities in many cultures. In fact, new technology has influences on educational system, jobs and foods in the world.";I concur that contemporary technology is fostering the emergence of a singular world culture. The swift evolution and globalization of technology have facilitated the spread of ideas, values, and beliefs across the globe, cultivating a sense of unity and shared culture among individuals from diverse backgrounds.A key factor in this phenomenon is the proliferation of social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. These platforms enable individuals to connect with each other, regardless of their geographical locations, thereby nurturing a sense of global community. For example, trends and challenges that start in one region can quickly go viral elsewhere, creating a collective experience among people around the world.Additionally, the worldwide availability of entertainment content—such as movies, music, and television shows—through streaming services like Netflix and YouTube has contributed to a collective cultural experience. People from different countries can enjoy and converse about the same content, bridging cultural divides and promoting a sense of global citizenship.Moreover, the internet has made it easier for individuals to access information and educational resources from anywhere in the world, fostering a standardized knowledge base and shared values. This not only contributes to the development of a unified world culture but also enhances global understanding and collaboration.However, it is important to recognize that while modern technology is facilitating the creation of a single world culture, it does not eliminate local cultures and traditions. Instead, it encourages a blending of cultures where local customs and values are preserved and shared on a global scale, enriching the diversity of the global cultural landscape.In summary, modern technology is indeed contributing to the formation of a unified world culture by promoting global connections, shared experiences, and access to information. While preserving local cultures is vital, the rise of a global culture is an inevitable and potentially enriching outcome of technological progress.
148;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Nowadays it is much easier to achieve success with the help from one's family than what is like before;There are many factors that contribute to one's success. However, which factor is the most influential one is open to debate. Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one's success. It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family. I agree with this statement. In my opinion, family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success. There are a couple of reasons.First of all, more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university. Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did, they can provide more advices and helps in our career. In the past, seldom people have the chance to attend a collage. For example, my grandparents did not get a education even in high school, so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood, he had to go to his teacher for help. Things have changed a lot. I grow up in a better condition than my father did. Whenever I have problems, I can always ask my parents for help. They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot. What is more, family members can help us in many other aspects. For example, when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university, my father told a lot about different majors. He shared his own experience with me, which helped me quite a lot. Parents are quite experienced than their child, they can guide them toward the right direction. Besides, parents can told their children as many as they can. What they want is help their child to make a progress.In a word, our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life. I believe that with the help of our family, we can achieve success quite easily.;The idea that family support makes achieving success easier today than in the past is a subject of ongoing discussion. I personally agree with this perspective. While family support has always been important for success, its importance has grown in modern society.Historically, families tended to be more self-reliant and relied less on outside assistance. However, with the rise of modern technology and the complexity of today’s world, the role of family support has changed. In the present day, having a supportive family can grant individuals access to invaluable networks, financial resources, and emotional encouragement. For example, a family member with industry connections might introduce a budding entrepreneur to potential investors or mentors, significantly boosting their opportunities for success.Additionally, the emotional backing from family members can serve as a tremendous motivator. Knowing there is a safety net and consistent encouragement can empower individuals to take risks and pursue their aspirations with greater resolve. This is often reflected in the narratives of many successful people who credit their accomplishments to the steadfast support of their families.On the other hand, those lacking strong family support frequently encounter more obstacles on their journey to success. They may have to face challenges independently, missing the benefits of guidance, financial help, or emotional encouragement. While it is certainly feasible to achieve success without familial support, the path is undeniably more challenging.In summary, the impact of family support on achieving success has become increasingly significant in today’s world. Given the intricate challenges we face, having a supportive family can provide crucial resources, connections, and motivation, making a substantial difference between success and failure. Thus, I firmly believe that it is indeed easier to attain success with family support today than it was in the past.
149;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Reading fiction (such as novels and short stories) is more enjoyable than watching movies. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;"There are many different opinions regarding hobbies. Some people would rather watch TV. However, in my view, reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons.Firstly, fiction books pay more attention to details. In fact, we can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it. Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening. For example, after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people. However, a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters.Secondly, reading a novel is more convenient. Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour. Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains. For example, I have started to read a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class. In contrast, I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study.Some people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies. This point has some merits on the surface; however, movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners. For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable.To sum up, reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners.";"I wholeheartedly endorse the idea that reading fiction is more pleasurable than watching movies. One key reason for this is that reading engages the imagination, allowing readers to construct their own settings, characters, and storylines, making the experience more personal and immersive. In contrast, movies present predefined visuals and characters, limiting the viewer's ability to use their imagination. For example, when delving into J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings,"" readers can picture Middle Earth and its inhabitants in their own distinct ways, often finding this mental imagery more enchanting than any film adaptation.Another factor that enhances the enjoyment of reading fiction is its capacity to offer a deeper insight into the characters’ thoughts, emotions, and motivations. Novels and short stories provide rich portrayals of characters' inner lives, fostering a stronger emotional bond with the reader. By comparison, movies, constrained by time, can only portray characters through their actions and dialogue, often neglecting crucial elements of their personalities. For instance, Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" delves into Elizabeth Bennet's inner struggles in a way that may not be fully conveyed in a film version.Additionally, reading fiction often provides a more immersive experience than watching films, as it requires active engagement from the reader. Readers must interpret the text, draw connections between events, and decipher the author's meaning, leading to a more dynamic and interactive experience. In summary, while movies can be entertaining, reading fiction offers a more enriching, immersive, and enjoyable experience through its capacity to ignite the imagination, deliver deeper character insights, and foster active reader involvement."
150;Several languages die every year. Many people feel this is a positive trend and that a world with fewer language promotes harmony and understanding between people. Analyze both sides of this argument and provide your opinion.;"Today, English is commonly used language across the world. Its usage is increasing day by day. As a consequence, various local languages are becoming extinct. Some people argue that, this is a positive change and would help people to easily communicate. While there are others who disagree with this and are more concerned about dying local languages. In my opinion, I believe using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live.A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way. Due to globalization, many people are traveling for professional trips. So, communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places. Furthermore, students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress as they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment. Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people. Adding to that, exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics, medical, astronomy etc would become easier.On the other hand, few people are worried about the dying local languages. These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures. They represent local culture. As the usage of these languages decrease, culture also changes accordingly. Further, these languages are tightly coupled with history; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost.To conclude, I believe change is inevitable and that usage of one language across the world is a positive one. We have to accept these changes for a world to be a better place. Communication in single language would improve the productivity of the world and brings everyone on to the same page.";The issue of language extinction has ignited a discussion regarding its effects on global unity and comprehension. Some individuals argue that a decline in the number of languages may encourage solidarity and enhance communication among people of various backgrounds. With fewer languages in use, the chances of misinterpretations and misunderstandings diminish, allowing for smoother interactions and collaborations. This could, in turn, nurture global harmony and mutual understanding.Conversely, others assert that language loss equates to a diminishment of cultural diversity and identity. Languages are deeply intertwined with the history, customs, and traditions of their communities, and their disappearance can result in a loss of cultural heritage. Additionally, linguistic diversity serves as a vital tool for individuals to articulate their unique identities and preserve their distinctiveness. Protecting languages is essential for honoring the richness of human expression and experience.In my view, the decline of languages is a detrimental trend that threatens cultural diversity and identity. While having fewer languages may streamline communication, it also risks cultural homogenization and marginalization of minority voices. The conservation of languages is vital for sustaining the depth and richness of human culture, and proactive measures should be implemented to support and promote linguistic diversity. Moreover, leveraging technology and language education can empower individuals to learn and communicate in several languages, fostering global understanding while preserving cultural identities. Ultimately, a world filled with diverse languages is one that appreciates and celebrates the unique perspectives and experiences of its people.
151;Elderly people think that the way they spent their life was simpler and better than today. Do you agree or disagree? Provide you reasons and real life example;Changes are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in. Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing. I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons.We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place. A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones. The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts. Moreover, some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication. In my opinion though, social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch, the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago. The phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in. Today, even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists. The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives. To be specific, scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough. In general, the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine.In conclusion, even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends, I think they are wrong, since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice. In light of the above-mentioned facts, one can easily conclude that in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically.;"Many elderly individuals hold a common belief that the past was simpler and superior. While it is natural to feel nostalgic about earlier times, I find myself only partly agreeing with this perspective. On one hand, it's true that life in the past might have been less complicated and more relaxed. The absence of modern technology meant that people engaged more in face-to-face interactions and enjoyed a stronger sense of community. For instance, my grandmother often shares fond memories of her childhood, where neighbors would gather for weekly dinners and children played outside until dusk. This sense of simplicity and camaraderie is something that seems to be lacking in today's world.Conversely, I believe the past had its own distinct challenges. Medical care, for instance, was much more rudimentary than what we have now. My grandfather, who lived with a chronic illness, frequently discusses the few treatment options available to him and the long recovery times he faced. In contrast, modern medicine has advanced remarkably, allowing individuals to lead longer and healthier lives. Additionally, the past was fraught with social and economic disparities, including limited access to education and job opportunities.In conclusion, while I recognize that the past possessed a certain charm and simplicity, I do not fully subscribe to the idea that it was better than today. Both past and present have their own advantages and disadvantages; therefore, it is unfair to claim that one era is superior to the other. By reflecting on the lessons of the past and valuing the progress of the present, we can strive to create a brighter future for everyone. Ultimately, it is up to each person to cherish the unique qualities of their own time and to seize the opportunities that come their way."
152;Some people say that all secondary school and higher school students should be taught how to manage money as its an important life skill. Do you agree or disagree with this argument?;There is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before. Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate. Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money, while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal. In my view, I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management.The reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is, primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation, students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family, during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence. For example, while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month, I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses, during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses.In addition, if financial management is taught at an early age, students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status, students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized. For example, buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background. However, for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour. Hence, having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently.In conclusion, I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact. However, the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense.;In recent years, the idea that secondary and higher education students should receive instruction in financial management has gained considerable attention. I firmly support this viewpoint, as financial management is a vital life skill that serves individuals well throughout their lives.In an era where financial literacy is essential for making informed choices, it is crucial for students to acquire the knowledge and skills needed to navigate the complexities of personal finance. By integrating money management into school programs, students can gain a comprehensive understanding of budgeting, saving, and investing. This knowledge can enable them to make sound financial decisions, steer clear of debt, and establish a secure financial future.Furthermore, educating students about money management can significantly influence their financial stability in the long run. It encourages the development of positive financial habits such as saving and budgeting, which can be advantageous over time. Additionally, it can help them avoid typical financial traps, such as accruing credit card debt or falling victim to scams.Moreover, providing financial education in schools fosters financial independence and responsibility among students. By mastering financial management techniques, students can become more self-reliant and less dependent on others for financial assistance. This empowerment can instill a sense of confidence, equipping them to take charge of their financial situations.In summary, teaching money management in secondary and higher education is a crucial life skill that offers numerous benefits to students. It enhances financial literacy, stability, and independence, ultimately empowering them to make informed choices regarding their finances. Therefore, I strongly believe that financial management education should be a staple in schools, as it plays a key role in shaping students' future financial well-being.
153;Some single people like to live with a roommate, while others prefer to live alone. Which would you prefer? Give specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many single people have difficulties deciding whether to live with a roommate or to live alone. Each makes different decisions. Some people choose to live alone for privacy, while others choose to live with a roommate for practical reasons. As far as I am concerned, I prefer to live with a roommate. This is because it saves me money, enables me to socialize, and allows me to get help.Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money. If you have roommates, you can split the rent and utilities among them. This means you can get more for less. For example, last year, I shared a room off-campus with my friend, and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half: I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating, and two hundred dollars for rent monthly. I was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills.Apart from saving a lot of money, living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily. It is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you. You can invite your roommates' friends over to your room and have fun together. For instance, one night, my roommate, Millan, brought his friends along. Even though his friends and I were total strangers to each other, we quickly got to know each other. We soon found out that everyone loved playing video games. We played a video game called 'Halo' together all night, and became good friends. Living with a roommate made socializing much easier for me.Finally, living with a roommate allows me to get help. It often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need. When you run into a problem, you can ask your roommates if they can help. Some of them may have something to offer. To illustrate, when my computer mysteriously broke down, I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help. They failed to give me any useful solutions. To my surprise, one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help. He was very good with computers, and he managed to fix the problem quickly.In conclusion, while many people decide to live alone for various reasons, I prefer to live with a roommate, and I always will. This is because it offers me many advantages, such as less spending, more socializing, and more help. I think single people should live with a roommate, if they want to enjoy their lives.;When it comes to housing preferences, some singles choose to live with roommates, while others prefer the peace of solitude. Personally, I lean towards living alone. The main reason for this choice is my appreciation for privacy and personal space. Having my own place allows me full control over my surroundings, enabling me to arrange my space according to my preferences and keep it as clean and orderly as I desire.Another key benefit of living alone is the freedom it provides. I’m not bound by anyone else's schedule or needs, so I can come and go freely, invite friends over whenever I like, and indulge in hobbies or binge-watch movies at any hour without worrying about disturbing anyone. This independence is especially valuable for those with unconventional work hours or those who enjoy nightlife.Furthermore, living alone encourages feelings of responsibility and self-reliance. Running a household by myself would teach me essential life skills like budgeting, cooking, and time management. It would also let me develop a daily routine tailored to my needs, aiding in a healthier and more balanced lifestyle.Although having a roommate can offer companionship and help with expenses, I believe the advantages of living alone far exceed these benefits. It creates a space where I can concentrate on personal development, relish my privacy, and lead a life defined by my own choices. It's a chance for self-discovery, allowing me to understand my strengths and weaknesses in an environment that is entirely my own. In summary, the independence, privacy, and opportunities for personal growth make living alone the ideal choice for me.
154;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants, and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld.;Generally speaking, smoking is never been good for human's body. There are so many researches done to prove that a cigar contains harmful ingredients for human's body. Although many smokers claim that they need to smoke in order to work more effectively or to think more creatively, those reasons never proves that smoking has any benefits for human's body. In my opinion, smoking should not be permitted, especially in public places like restaurants because it will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably.First of all, restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals. Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals. They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them. Secondly, restaurants are places that people usually come with their families. This means, there will be children, grandparents, as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants. Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children. Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something. Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders' health, especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs. The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies.Last but not least, passive smokers will have a lot of health risks. When they are around the active smokers, they will inhale hazardous smoke. Stroke, heart disorders, hearing loss, and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers. Personally speaking, it is unfair for passive smokers because they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one.In conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants because there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged. State laws that prohibit it should be upheld so the restaurant' management can make a clear rule in their restaurants because everyone has a right to enjoy their meals.;I completely support the idea that smoking should be banned in restaurants, and state laws enforcing such a ban should be maintained. Allowing smoking in these establishments poses serious health risks not only to customers but also to employees. Research has shown that secondhand smoke, or passive smoke, can lead to various grave health issues, including lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory infections.In addition, smoking in restaurants can inconvenience non-smokers, who may find the odor and smoke bothersome and disruptive to their dining experience. In a communal space like a restaurant, it is only fair to expect a smoke-free atmosphere where diners can enjoy their meals without the threat of harmful smoke. Upholding state laws that prohibit smoking indoors is crucial for safeguarding public health and ensuring that dining establishments remain comfortable and enjoyable for all.Furthermore, the presence of smoking in restaurants can have financial repercussions. Many patrons might decide to steer clear of venues that allow smoking, potentially resulting in decreased business and revenue. Conversely, smoke-free restaurants can appeal to a broader clientele, including families and health-conscious patrons, who favor a smoke-free dining environment. In summary, banning smoking in restaurants is vital for protecting public health, providing an enjoyable dining experience, and supporting the economic health of the establishments. Consequently, I strongly advocate for the enforcement and preservation of state laws that prohibit smoking in restaurants to foster a healthier and more considerate environment for everyone.
155;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way?;It's obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years. This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film. From my point of view, I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors, emotions & study.In the first place, children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best. Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs. Imagine an actor who is a child’s favorite is doing violent roles. In this case, the child would imitate the actor's behaviors in order to look like to him. Thus, unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors.Meanwhile, human beings are very sensitive, especially of youngsters. For instance, dying is always a disappointing happening. Furthermore, killing is worse. Therefore, if these scenes are in TV, they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child.Finally, beside all above mentioned items, the study of youngsters shall always been controlled. For example, a child watches a frightening movie. On the other hand, he has to study for the exam. In this condition, because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it, it is obvious that he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly. Hence, the study of a youngster would affected terribly.In conclusion, I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study, emotions and behaviors. Therefore, I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors.;The assertion that the rise of violence in films has adversely affected young people is a subject of ongoing discussion among academics and the public alike. Personally, I firmly support this view. The growing prevalence of violence in movies has significantly influenced the behavior and attitudes of youth.Exposure to violent films can numb children and teenagers to the repercussions of violence, rendering it more palatable and even glorified. This desensitization can result in diminished empathy and an uptick in aggressive actions. Furthermore, repeatedly watching violent scenes may alter young people’s perceptions of reality, leading them to anticipate and participate in violent conduct. This impact can be particularly harmful for those who are already vulnerable, such as individuals from unstable backgrounds or those with prior behavioral issues.Additionally, studies indicate that young people exposed to violent films are more inclined to engage in delinquent acts, including fighting, vandalism, and other antisocial behaviors. These films often serve as a template for violent reactions, normalizing such behaviors as acceptable solutions to conflict. The romanticization of violence can also incite an interest in weapons and a tendency to emulate the violent actions portrayed on screen.In summary, the increasing violence in films has indeed had detrimental effects on young people. Violent portrayals can shape their attitudes and behaviors, leading to a reduction in empathy and an increase in aggression. It is crucial for parents, caregivers, and filmmakers to be aware of the content they create and consume, and to take proactive measures to minimize the potential negative impacts of violent media. By doing so, we can foster a more positive and peaceful influence on future generations.
156;Agree or disagree: In order to be well-informed, a person must get information from many different news sources.;"Nowadays information plays an important role in our world. It has become a product, which can be sold, bought, or stolen. Some people say: ""information is power"". That's why it is so important to be well-informed. I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons.The first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability. Some people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information. For example, Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia. After a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia.Secondly, it is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations, because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate. Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts, especially in the internet, that's why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts. It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong. For example, several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops. The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the ""salt-panic"" was over. To conclude, I want to say that it is very important to be confident of the information, which you use, especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence.";"In today's fast-paced world, being well-informed is more crucial than ever. With an abundance of news sources at our disposal, it is vital to diversify our information intake to fully understand current events. I strongly believe that to be truly informed, one must seek news from a variety of outlets.Relying solely on one news source can result in a limited and skewed perspective, as each outlet tends to have its own biases and interpretations. By engaging with multiple sources, especially those with differing viewpoints and editorial slants, individuals can cultivate a more nuanced and balanced understanding of various issues. This approach allows readers to spot patterns, inconsistencies, and areas of consensus, thereby empowering them to form their own well-informed opinions.Additionally, different news outlets often excel in particular subjects or regions; some may provide deeper insights into local or international news. For example, someone interested in global issues might benefit from a mix of BBC, Al Jazeera, and CNN, offering a fuller picture of world events instead of relying on a single source. Likewise, for local news, consulting various regional publications and online platforms is essential to stay updated on community matters.In summary, accessing a broad spectrum of news sources is vital for anyone aiming to be well-informed. This practice helps avoid biased reporting, enhances understanding of current events, and aids in forming educated opinions. In an age where misinformation can spread swiftly, consulting multiple news sources is more important than ever to achieve a well-rounded and accurate view of the world."
157;Some people argue that there is no point in persevering old buildings when land is so valuable in our cities. Others believe that old buildings are important part of our heritage and should be preserved. Discuss both these views and state your opinion.;The preservation of old buildings always is a large question for governments because conflict between the issues of housing for citizens and the protection of our culture. In my opinion, all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved.There are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings. As a result of the rapid urbanization process, in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities, the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing. Because of that need, governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings. Besides that, the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values. Old buildings are an essential part of history. Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings. Therefore, managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation. Furthermore, the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them. Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there. . Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty, and that preservation help to finish half of work.	Overall, both of those view have strong arguments: the need for housing or the expense of restoration contrast with our desire to conserve culture and attract tourism. So I think we should restore those building because old buildings process the most outstanding feature of areas which contain them.;The ongoing debate regarding the preservation of old buildings versus their demolition for new developments has been a significant topic for years. On one side, proponents of demolition argue that aging structures hinder progress and that the land they occupy is too valuable to be occupied by outdated designs. They contend that these buildings can be replaced with modern, more efficient alternatives that would yield higher revenue and enhanced amenities. This viewpoint is especially common in urban areas where space is limited and the demand for housing and commercial space is high.Conversely, there are those who advocate for the preservation of old buildings as vital components of our cultural heritage. They believe these structures forge a connection to our past, serving as reminders of historical events that have shaped our society. Furthermore, many old buildings showcase unique architectural styles and character that are often lost in contemporary designs. Their preservation not only enhances the aesthetic charm of our cities but also makes them more appealing to both tourists and residents.In my view, preserving old buildings is crucial. While land may hold significant monetary value, the cultural and historical importance of these structures far exceeds their economic worth. By safeguarding them, we honor our history and offer future generations a meaningful link to their heritage. Additionally, with thoughtful restoration and repurposing, old buildings can be modified to meet modern needs, thereby becoming valuable and sustainable assets. Therefore, I strongly advocate for the preservation and protection of old buildings in order to enrich our collective cultural identity.
158;Nowadays, many young people say that mobile phones are the most important thing in their life. Do you think the popularity of mobile phones to young people is a good or bad development? Give relevant examples from your own experience.;Nowadays, many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends. Despite all these positive aspects, I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development.First of all, many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones. Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time, leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities. Similarly, internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works. In my college days, I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone. I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends. That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester.Secondly, juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic. They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand. Relatively, these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost. Furthermore, most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want. An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days, wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents. This clearly shows that the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person’s education and character. Therefore, I highly discourage the young ones to be overly dependent on mobile phones.;The extensive use of mobile phones among young people has become a common aspect of modern society. While some people view mobile phones as essential tools, others argue that they negatively affect the younger generation. Personally, I believe that the prevalence of mobile phones among youth presents both advantages and disadvantages.On one hand, mobile phones allow young individuals to stay connected with family and friends and provide access to a wealth of information and educational resources. For example, I frequently use my mobile phone to communicate with friends living overseas and to find online study materials that assist me with my homework. Additionally, mobile phones empower young people to document and share their experiences, creativity, and ideas through social media, serving as a valuable means of self-expression and community engagement.Conversely, excessive reliance on mobile phones can contribute to social isolation, a reduced attention span, and weakened face-to-face communication skills. I have observed many friends and classmates spending hours on their phones, engrossed in social media, gaming, or videos instead of engaging in physical activities, reading, or meaningful conversations. This behavior can adversely affect their mental and physical well-being, as well as their relationships and academic performance.In summary, while mobile phones offer significant benefits to young people, their widespread use can lead to negative outcomes if not managed wisely. It is crucial for young individuals to find a balance between their use of mobile phones and other life activities, and for parents, educators, and policymakers to encourage healthy mobile habits and digital literacy among youth.
159;Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Others, however,argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.;"Generally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders. Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime. Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions, that forces to a person to be a criminal.First of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime. Secondly, laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance ""a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women, who steals for her drug addiction"". The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place.On the contrary, fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government. Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal. Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other.To conclude, Government should decide for punishment case by case basis. In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution.";The ongoing debate about whether to implement fixed punishments or to consider the context of individual crimes has persisted for years. Advocates for fixed punishments argue that this method offers consistency and fairness in legal proceedings, ensuring that anyone committing the same type of crime receives the same penalty, irrespective of their motivations or specific circumstances. This strategy is perceived as a deterrent, informing potential offenders of the consequences they will face if apprehended.Conversely, critics of fixed punishments contend that this approach is too simplistic and overlooks the complexities inherent in real-life scenarios. They argue that the context in which a crime occurs and the underlying motivations are vital for determining suitable penalties. For example, a person who steals food to support their family is fundamentally different from someone who commits theft for personal gain. By taking these factors into account, the justice system can deliver more nuanced and just punishments that appropriately reflect an individual's level of responsibility.Furthermore, considering the context of a crime can enhance the effectiveness of rehabilitation and reintegration efforts for offenders. Understanding the motivations and circumstances that led to the offense allows the justice system to offer targeted support and interventions, addressing the root issues and reducing the chances of reoffending. In summary, while fixed punishments may offer a sense of consistency, it is vital to consider the specifics of each crime to ensure that justice is not only served but that punishments are fair, effective, and conducive to rehabilitation.
160;Some people prefer to spend their free time outdoors. Other people prefer to spend their leisure time indoors. Would you prefer to be outside or would you prefer to be inside for your leisure activities? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your choice.;People often relax themselves by joining leisure activities. Some people prefer to spend their free time indoors. But from my experience, I myself prefer to spend my leisure time outdoors because I strongly feel that it is good for health and keep my body fit. Also, outdoor activities enable me to socialize with other people and enjoy natural beauty.There are strong advantages to spend leisure time outdoors. One benefit is that doing outdoor activities such as soccer and baseball is good for one's health. For instance, last year, I spent my summer time playing soccer and baseball. Playing baseball provided my upper body for hitting and throwing. Soccer, on the other hand, developed my lower body for kicking and endurance for playing full 90-minute-games. I belive that practicing these sports helped me greatly. Something else that is good is that playing these sports is to keep my body fit, make me ultimately refreshed. After that summer, my body is stronger and endurance is better. Outdoor activities not only improves my health but also gives me chances to communicate with more people. When I was ten years old, I was a shy girl. My mother took me to The National Camp. At first, I just ate and played alone. But on the third day, while I was swimming, a friendly girl came and greeted me, we became friend later and she taught me how to swim effectively. On the next day, we played together and she introduced me to her friends. Thanks to her and outdoor activities such as going skiing, climbing the mountain, I had a lot of friends since The National Camp. If, for example, I hadn't participate in that camping, I wouldn't have had many friends like today. Moreover, you can also enjoy the beautiful nature when doing some outdoor activities like going hiking, sunbathing, going biking. If you spend your spare time at home or something like that, you can't enjoy beautiful nature. Spending time outdoors, people can breathe fresh air, feel the warm sun on their face and enjoy the complete peace that only nature brings.Admittedly, indoor activities are fun. There's no doubt that indoor activities like reading a book, watching TV or listening to music can bring us lots of joy. Although I can also have fun in indoor activities, this advantage cannot outweigh the attractions coming from outdoor activities. After all, people are people and we have our own propensity. Leisure activities are one of them and I myself choose outdoor activities to spend my leisure time.;When it comes to leisure activities, I strongly advocate for spending time outdoors as the superior choice. Engaging with nature not only fosters a deep connection to the environment, but it also brings a multitude of mental and physical health advantages. For example, activities like hiking, walking, or simply enjoying a park can effectively diminish stress and anxiety while promoting an uplifted mood and general well-being.In contrast, indoor leisure often leads to a more sedentary lifestyle, filled with watching TV, playing video games, or scrolling through social media. Although these activities can be enjoyable, they may contribute to a lack of physical movement, social disconnection, and reduced access to natural light and fresh air. In comparison, outdoor engagements allow for physical exercise, social interaction, and the appreciation of nature's beauty.Personally, I prefer to spend my free time outdoors as it helps me recharge and regain focus. For instance, going for a morning run or bike ride clears my mind and prepares me for the day ahead. Outdoor pursuits such as camping, picnicking, or simply relaxing in a garden or backyard offer a sense of freedom and adventure that is often missing from indoor pastimes.In summary, while some individuals may enjoy indoor leisure, I firmly believe that outdoor activities are the better choice. With their extensive physical and mental health benefits, opportunities for socialization and exercise, and the chance to engage with nature, outdoor pursuits provide a unique and fulfilling experience that greatly enhances the overall quality of life.
161;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;The rise of affordable air travel has transformed the way people journey, granting them a unique opportunity to discover far-off places. Advocates for budget airlines argue that this accessibility democratizes travel, allowing everyday individuals to immerse themselves in varied cultures and landscapes that were once out of reach. This shift has not only revitalized the tourism sector but has also stimulated economic growth and fostered global understanding. Additionally, affordable flights have connected families, facilitated business engagements, and encouraged educational exchanges across the globe.Conversely, detractors highlight the severe environmental impacts of widespread cheap air travel. The aviation sector significantly contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, noise pollution, and habitat destruction. The growing appetite for air travel, driven by low-cost carriers, intensifies these issues, jeopardizing the ecosystems that travelers wish to appreciate. Some suggest that increasing air travel costs could help mitigate these challenges by discouraging unnecessary trips and promoting more sustainable transportation alternatives.In my view, while the environmental issues raised are valid, a straightforward increase in ticket prices might not be the most effective remedy. Instead, a more nuanced strategy could be pursued, combining moderate fare increases with investments in sustainable aviation technologies and practices. This might include initiatives such as carbon offset programs, the use of more fuel-efficient aircraft, and optimized flight paths. Moreover, airlines and governments could encourage eco-friendly travel choices and inform passengers about the ecological consequences of their travel decisions. By embracing this comprehensive approach, we can harmonize the advantages of budget air travel with the imperative to safeguard our environment for future generations. Ultimately, by adopting responsible and sustainable air travel practices, we can ensure that the freedom to explore the world does not come at the cost of preserving it.
162;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;There are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town. The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner, quieter and often friendlier place to live. However, despite the advantages of small town life, I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons.On the one hand, I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area. To make it convenient, I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace. What's more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city.On the other hand, life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town. You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities. For instance, you can visit museums to learn history, and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading, or you can go to a sports center for exercising. But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs.Furthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information. If one can efficiently acquire the information, then, there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals. For example, there are various advertisements here an there, whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones. If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel, or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store, he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice. There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring. Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government, which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers. Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development. In conclusion, if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities, and have my children receive a better education, a big city is the place to live in.;The discussion over whether to reside in a small town or a large city has persisted for years. While many individuals appreciate the tranquility and tight-knit feel of a small town, I personally favor the vibrancy of city life. There are several key reasons why I lean towards urban living.Firstly, large cities present a multitude of job opportunities, which is a crucial consideration when selecting a place to live. As prominent centers for various industries and businesses, cities offer a wide array of career paths. For instance, New York City stands out as a global financial hub, attracting individuals seeking careers in finance, law, and other related fields. In contrast, small towns often have fewer employment options, making it challenging for residents to find jobs that align with their skills and interests.Secondly, big cities boast an abundance of cultural and entertainment choices. From museums and art galleries to diverse dining and theater experiences, urban areas are alive with dynamic cultural offerings. For example, London is renowned for its world-class museums, like the British Museum, and its iconic West End for theater. In a small town, such cultural and entertainment amenities may be limited or entirely absent.Lastly, large cities tend to be more diverse and cosmopolitan, providing a unique and enriching living experience. Cities like Tokyo, Paris, and Sydney are vibrant melting pots of various cultures, cuisines, and lifestyles, creating an exciting and stimulating environment. In summary, while small towns possess their own allure, I believe that the advantages of living in a big city—such as ample job prospects, cultural richness, and diversity—make it the clear choice for me.
163;Salary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways to reward employees for good work. What other rewards for good work can be effective in encouraging further good work? Use specific examples to support your response.;It is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work. Besides the methods, from my point of view, providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work. My arguments for this point are listed follows.Firstly, training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind. Clearly, in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer, complaining from boss, etc. Therefore, we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends, joking in class, enjoying new knowledge.Secondly, employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained. In this case, the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company. So obviously, they will think about develop long term career with their company. For another thing, employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don't have this opportunity. Thirdly, providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge. Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business, so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result. Of course, excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss.In conclusion, providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages. Training can help employees refresh their mind as well as make them happy, focus on work. Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that training can be effective in encouraging further good work.;"Recognizing employees for their outstanding performance is vital for fostering motivation and encouraging continued excellence. While traditional rewards like salary raises and promotions are common methods of acknowledgment, they are not the sole means of rewarding employees. Other forms of recognition can be equally effective in creating a supportive workplace atmosphere.One alternative form of reward is offering additional time off or flexible work options. For example, a company might provide extra vacation days or allow employees to telecommute one day a week. Such rewards not only commend the employee's dedication but also enhance their work-life balance, which can subsequently boost job satisfaction and performance. Google, well-known for its generous leave policies, allows employees to take time off for personal projects, ultimately spurring innovative ideas and solutions.Another valuable reward is the opportunity for professional development and advancement. This could involve training sessions, workshops, or conferences that align with the employee's interests. By investing in their workforce's skills and knowledge, companies convey their dedication to their employees' career growth and long-term success. For instance, Microsoft provides its employees with access to a variety of online courses and training programs, resulting in a highly skilled and motivated team.Lastly, public acknowledgment and appreciation serve as powerful motivators. From an ""employee of the month"" award to recognition ceremonies, such initiatives can significantly enhance employee morale and inspire others to pursue similar accolades. Companies like Facebook showcase their employees' achievements on a ""Wall of Fame,"" illustrating the positive impact of public recognition on motivation and engagement.In summary, rewarding employees for their exceptional contributions is essential for maintaining motivation and job satisfaction. Although salary increases and promotions are valuable, they aren't the only effective forms of recognition. Alternative rewards, including extra time off, professional development opportunities, and public acknowledgment, can be equally motivating and contribute to a more positive and productive workplace."
164;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Attending university's classes is one of activities that students have to do. However, class is not the only source of knowledge. Students also learn from other sources such as experience, libraries and other people. I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons.Firstly, the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room. Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand. For example, I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university. She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast. Thus, she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic. Finally, she got very good grade when she was graduation.Secondly, students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well. In my experience, many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes. Also, I had already studied all biology topics before attending university. As a result, I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A+ for both biology and chemistry. In conclusion, I think the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time. Also, they have to know how to deal with the effects from not attending classes. So that, attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore.;The discussion about whether university students should be mandated to attend classes has sparked considerable debate. While some advocate for compulsory attendance, I strongly believe that students should have the option to decide for themselves whether to attend. This viewpoint stems from the belief that university students are adults who should take responsibility for their own education.Firstly, making attendance optional empowers students to take charge of their learning journey. By allowing them the freedom to choose how and when they learn, students can tailor their schedules to fit their specific needs and preferred learning styles. This level of autonomy can boost motivation and engagement, as students are likely to participate in classes that genuinely interest them. Additionally, with the proliferation of online learning platforms and digital resources, students can access course materials and learn at their own pace, even if they miss a class.Another important benefit of optional attendance is that it acknowledges the varied responsibilities and commitments that university students often juggle. Many students balance their studies with part-time jobs, family responsibilities, and other extracurricular activities. By eliminating the requirement for mandatory attendance, students can manage their time more efficiently, allowing them to fulfill their different obligations without sacrificing their academic success.In summary, allowing university students to choose whether to attend classes promotes a more effective and respectful approach to higher education. It acknowledges students' maturity and ability to direct their own learning while accommodating the complexities of their lives beyond the classroom. By trusting students to make their own attendance decisions, universities can cultivate a more independent, motivated, and successful community of learners.
165;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in?;In a few years I will finish my studying in the university and I will have to decide whether to live in a small town or a big city. As I am eager to get a good job and explore different places, I think I would prefer to live in a city.Big city life provides many opportunities. First of all, it will be easier for me to find an engineering job in the city. Electrical engineering deals with problems concerning electricity supply. Therefore, a big city can offer me many more vacancies than a small town.At the weekends, there is a great number of things to do in the metropolis. There are numerous bars, cafes and restaurants where I can go with my friends. Multinational cities have restaurants with different national cuisines. I am fond of Italian food, and if there is an Italian restaurant in the city, I will definitely visit it.A night club is an interesting place to visit for young people. There a person can listen to music, make new friends or enjoy a a drink alone. Cultural life of a metropolis is always an entertaining one. I am keen on museums and it would be a pleasure for me to spend several hours a week in front of famous paintings, sculptures or artifacts. On special dates, city offers free exhibitions which are available for everyone who is interested in art.What's more, cities have better medical facilities than in the countryside. This can at least assure me that if I feel bad, city can provide a high quality help. In conclusion, while small towns have picturesque nature and pure air, big cities offer countless amount of opportunities and entertainment places. Considering all the benefits, I would choose to live in a big city.;The discussion about choosing between life in a small town and a big city has persisted for years. Some individuals cherish the serenity and tight-knit community of a small town, while others are drawn to the lively atmosphere of urban life. Personally, I lean toward the appeal of living in a big city.Residing in a big city comes with a host of advantages, such as enhanced job prospects, access to quality education, and a myriad of entertainment options. Urban areas tend to be vibrant centers for various industries, providing a broad spectrum of career possibilities. Furthermore, cities often host renowned universities and educational institutions, ensuring excellent opportunities for learning and research. With an abundance of attractions—museums, theaters, and music venues—big cities are perfect for those who appreciate a rich cultural landscape.Conversely, while small towns offer a serene and laid-back lifestyle, they frequently lack the resources and prospects that cities provide. The limited job market, fewer entertainment choices, and restricted access to quality education can be significant downsides of small-town living. Additionally, small towns can feel isolating, with fewer social interactions and a lack of diversity.In summary, although small towns have their appeal, I believe the advantages of city life far surpass those of small-town living. The opportunities for both personal and professional advancement, the cultural diversity, and the lively atmosphere make big cities highly appealing to me. In the end, the energetic and ever-evolving nature of urban environments suits my lifestyle, offering the ideal blend of work, leisure, and personal growth.
166;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;The advent of the computer is one of the results of the development of the advantaged technology. While some people advocate for the idea that computers have made life more complex and stressful, others support the idea that computers have made life easier and more convenient. In my point of view, computers brought convenience and easiness to our life since they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication. First, computers through internet made our access to information easier. Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed. Search engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes. Social networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments. Hence, with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources. Second, in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper. With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes. In addition, it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world. Internet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible. For example, via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities. In result, communication has become cheaper, faster and visual. Finally, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient in the ways that it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways.;The rise of computers has ignited a lively discussion about their influence on our daily lives. While some contend that computers have added complexity and stress, I strongly maintain that they have simplified life and enhanced convenience. I believe the advantages of computers significantly outweigh any downsides.To begin with, computers offer us remarkable access to a wealth of information just a click away. With the internet, we can effortlessly research, learn, and keep up with current events like never before. For example, online shopping allows us to buy items and services from the comfort of our own homes, saving us both time and energy. Additionally, computers have transformed global communication, enabling us to connect with individuals worldwide through social media, email, and video conferencing.Another key benefit of computers is their capacity to automate repetitive tasks, thus allowing us more time for creative and intellectual endeavors. Accounting software can efficiently manage financial transactions, while project management tools help us stay organized and focused. This has significantly alleviated the stress linked with manual tasks, empowering us to concentrate on strategic and high-value activities.In summary, although critics may argue that computers have brought about new challenges, such as cybercrime and information overload, I believe their overall impact is largely positive. By granting unparalleled access to information, enhancing global communication, and streamlining routine tasks, computers have undoubtedly made life easier and more convenient. As technology continues to progress, I look forward to discovering the new possibilities and opportunities that computers will introduce into our lives.
167;Computers and modems have made it possible for office workers to do their work from home instead of working in offices every day. Working from home should be encouraged for workers and employees as it is good. Do you agree or dis? ;Some people think that working at home brings to workers and employees too much convenience, but i don't. Because the best conditions are sometimes not likely to be good as the expectation of people. Working without pressure and interaction are some examples for these disadvantages.Pressure is motivation. Each office has its rules that keep workers do their job as effectively as possible. The directors manage employers and give them the deadline of projects. Then again, the workers must try their best to finish the time limit. Doing all jobs at home don't make employees attempt to work like this. Computers and modems bring works to home but these still have many things distract their mind. Facebook or Yahoo have been the entertaining websites, however, they are the reasons why people cannot concentrate on their job. The dos and don't at office play important role to prevent these things from workers. In condition, doing all jobs alone makes employees fall asleep easily. As a result, the project cannot being done. The best condition might not be good for people. Interaction has been an advantage for workers at offices. Discussing and debating Projects together increase working ability because all we know that the target can be reached fast thanks to working of many people. Besides, interaction help employees improve their communicational skills, therefore, they will have more and more friends and relationships. Interaction is a factor increasing working quality.There will have many disadvantages if the workers work at home. Mitigating process, no interaction and pressure are these things people should examine when they want to work at home.;The rise of computers and modems has transformed the workplace, allowing office employees to complete their duties from home. This trend, known as telecommuting or remote work, has ignited a vibrant discussion regarding its advantages. I firmly believe that working from home should be promoted for all workers.On one hand, remote work presents a variety of benefits, such as enhanced flexibility and a better work-life balance. By eliminating the daily commute, employees can manage their time more efficiently, which enables them to focus on personal responsibilities and overall well-being. Additionally, working from home minimizes the stress and exhaustion linked to commuting, potentially leading to greater productivity and job satisfaction.On the other hand, telecommuting can also result in financial savings for both workers and employers. Employees can cut down on transportation costs, professional attire, and meal expenses, while employers can lower overhead by reducing the size of office spaces. Moreover, remote work often decreases absenteeism and lateness, as individuals are likely to be more consistent and punctual when working in their own environments.However, some critics argue that remote work can cause distractions and diminish motivation. Nevertheless, with the right attitude and self-discipline, employees can maintain focus and drive while working from home. In fact, many organizations that have adopted telecommuting policies report higher productivity and employee satisfaction levels. In summary, I strongly advocate for working from home as it provides significant benefits for both employees and employers, fostering a more effective, productive, and content workforce.
168;Some people think that a university professor should focus time on doing research, while others think that the main role of a professor is to educate students in a university. What is your opinion and why? Use specific reasons to support your answer.Ê;Nowadays, many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities. Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field, the research takes up too much teaching time. As far as I am concerned, professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research.To begin with, it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge. The professors’ duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses. If professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes. The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies. In this way, professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students. Therefore, professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research.On the other hand, if professors are busy in doing research, ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students, it would ruin the reputation of universities. Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course, and the enrollment of universities may decline. Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study. In this way, hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects. It is adverse to the whole academic field. Accordingly, spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors, rather than research.Nevertheless, professors could teach students through research and projects. Some students enjoy taking part in some research. Through to use the equipment and invent their own work, they may get more experience in the process of research. For instance, electronic students always invent new machines such as robots, MP3 and remote control car. They can manage the electric theory in practical skills. And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions. However, only under specific circumstance, when students master all of the systematic knowledge, can they accomplish research. This is requires professors provide high quality courses. In other word, professor should concern about preparing class.Consequently, conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent. However, the precondition of doing research is growing students’ solid theory fundamental. Only by developing students, can we have a better academic field. Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way.;The role of a university professor has been a topic of extensive discussion, with some advocating that their primary emphasis should be on research, while others contend that their foremost duty is to educate students. Personally, I believe that the primary role of a professor should center around student education within a university setting.To begin with, a professor's fundamental obligation is to share knowledge and skills with their students. Universities serve as centers of learning, where students seek to acquire the expertise necessary for their future careers. Professors, as experts in their respective fields, are uniquely equipped to deliver this education. By prioritizing teaching, professors can ensure that students receive a robust education, adequately preparing them for the professional world.Moreover, although research is a significant component of a professor's responsibilities, it should not overshadow their teaching commitments. In reality, research and teaching can complement each other, enabling many professors to bring insights from their research directly into the classroom. This integration enriches the educational experience, providing students with current and comprehensive knowledge.Additionally, professors who prioritize teaching typically have more availability to offer guidance and support to their students, which is crucial for their academic success. Conversely, those who are overly focused on research may lack the time or energy to provide the necessary support, potentially hindering student performance.In summary, while research is certainly a vital element of a professor's responsibilities, I maintain that their primary role lies in educating students. By emphasizing teaching, professors can ensure that students obtain a quality education that sets them up for future success.
169;Technological progress in the past century has its negative effect, despite its remarkable contribution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In the past few decades, there were many remarkable achievements in technology fields that have numbers of beneficial effects on the whole society or individuals, although bringing some disadvantages to us.On one hand, the development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards. Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools, which play an important role in economic activity. Because of the technology of internet and air transportation, businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions. This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue.Besides, advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard. With the improvement of medical technology, it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before, and many serious diseases are under control. Digital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies, and this means that we could get more happiness from technology.On the other hand, the development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society. People utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas, and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions. This would pose a large threat to the ecology and environment. Vehicle technology enables many people to drive private cars, and emission of exhaust gas could lead to air pollution in large cities.In conclusion, although technological progress causes corresponding problems, it still provides us with much more advantages.;The last hundred years have seen extraordinary technological progress that has reshaped how we live, work, and communicate. Although these advancements have played a vital role in modern society, I believe they also bring about significant drawbacks.On one side, technology has greatly enhanced our quality of life, boosted productivity, and improved global communication. The emergence of the internet, mobile devices, and medical innovations has allowed for swift access to information and better health outcomes. Additionally, these technological breakthroughs have spawned new industries, job opportunities, and economic growth.Conversely, we cannot ignore the detrimental impacts of technological advancement. Our increasing dependence on technology has led to serious environmental issues, particularly concerning e-waste and high energy consumption. Moreover, the rise of social media has weakened interpersonal communication skills and facilitated the spread of false information. The automation of jobs has also caused considerable unemployment, worsening income inequality and fueling social tensions.In summary, while technological progress has significantly contributed to development and improvement, its negative aspects must be recognized. It is essential for individuals, organizations, and governments to be aware of these issues and strive to address them. By adopting sustainable practices, encouraging responsible technology use, and investing in education and retraining initiatives, we can alleviate the negative consequences of technological advancement and ensure that its advantages are shared fairly. Ultimately, a balanced approach to technological growth is essential for securing a thriving and sustainable future for everyone.
170;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;"The principle that ""prevention is better than cure"" is widely recognized in healthcare. Recently, there has been increasing discussion about whether a substantial part of a nation's health budget should be dedicated to health education and preventative strategies instead of treatment. I firmly support this viewpoint, as preventative initiatives can greatly alleviate the burden of diseases and enhance overall public health.Allocating a significant portion of the health budget to health education and prevention can lead to a marked decrease in disease incidence. By providing public awareness about healthy lifestyles, disease prevention, and early detection, individuals can take proactive steps to safeguard their well-being. Furthermore, preventative interventions like vaccinations, immunizations, and routine health screenings can help identify and address health issues before they escalate. This proactive approach can ultimately result in considerable savings in healthcare costs over time, as it diminishes the reliance on costly treatments and hospital stays.Moreover, investing in health education and preventative measures can yield positive economic outcomes. A healthier workforce is generally more productive, and decreased rates of sick leave and hospital admissions can boost economic performance. Additionally, a focus on prevention can alleviate pressure on healthcare systems, enabling them to concentrate on delivering high-quality care to those in need.In summary, channeling a significant portion of a country's health budget toward health education and preventative measures is a prudent choice. By prioritizing prevention, countries can lessen the burden of diseases, enhance public health, and decrease healthcare expenses. Although treatment remains important, prevention truly is preferable to cure, and it is essential for governments to emphasize preventative strategies to foster a healthier and more sustainable healthcare system."
171;Students at a university often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.;Many students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages. After considering the level of freedom, the studying conditions and the economic factor, if I had to choose, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories.First, an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory. While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules, in the apartment you set your own rules. You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want. An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student. This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory.Second, from an economic point of view, people often argue that an apartment is more expensive. This is only partially true, you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper. Transportation is another issue, you have to go to and return from the university everyday. You could choose to use public transportation, a cheaper option, or to have a car. The car is an expensive option, but also offers freedom of schedule and destination.Lastly, the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don't have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories. A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times. Since in an apartment you don't have a roommate, you won't have this problem, and as a result you would be able to concentrate better. For the same reason, you won't have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music, bring friends over, or study late at night. You set your own schedules. In the other hand, living in a dormitory, and being surrounded by students also has some advantages, like being able to get help with any academic issues from them. To conclude, both options have their advantages, but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory.;Choosing where to live while attending university is an important decision that can greatly influence a student's academic and social journey. Two common options are university dormitories and community apartments, each offering distinct benefits.Living in university dorms has numerous advantages. Primarily, it provides students with a convenient and immersive experience, placing them at the center of campus life. Dormitories are generally located within walking distance of classes, libraries, and other facilities, making it easy for students to attend lectures, join study groups, and engage in campus events. Furthermore, dorms typically include helpful support systems such as resident advisors and organized social activities, which can assist students in adapting to university life and forging friendships.Conversely, opting for an apartment in the community comes with its own perks. Apartments usually offer more space and privacy than dorm rooms, granting students greater autonomy and independence. Living off-campus also presents opportunities to connect with the local community, enriching the overall university experience. Additionally, community apartments often provide flexible lease arrangements and can be more budget-friendly, especially when shared with roommates.Personally, I would choose to live in university dormitories during my first year. I value being fully immersed in campus life and having easy access to university resources. The support and social opportunities available in dorms are invaluable for a freshman aiming to build a solid academic and social foundation. However, in later years, I might explore moving to an apartment to enjoy the independence and community engagement it offers. Ultimately, the decision between university housing and community apartments hinges on individual priorities and circumstances, with what works best for one student potentially differing for another.
172;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Have you ever seen a real life bear or a monkey? If you did, it was probably at a zoo. Zoos are big outdoor spaces in which different animal species are kept, so that people can look, learn and admire them. A lot of people think that zoos have no use, or provide no purpose. I strongly disagree with this affirmation because I believe zoos provide social interaction, education, and develop qualities such as animal respect and understanding.When people visit the zoo, they normally do it in a group, with their families, or as a part of a school group activity. In the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals, play with some of them, comment on their appearance and behavior, and laugh at their funny customs. Nowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago. The zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family, it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member, from little children to grandparents. Animals, the different species, their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities. We can learn a lot from books and lectures, but there is an even better way to learn, that is visuals and personal experience. If you visit the zoo, you get to watch the animals, their customs, what they eat and how they eat it, as well as which characteristics the different species have. In the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations, the male and the female or the baby and the adult. It offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations, such as weather, specie and genre interaction, defense behavior, or protection of their babies. Moreover, it will also help identify which animals could be dangerous. Visiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school. Finally, a visit to the zoo will help increasing someone's respect and appreciation for animals. It is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it, and learned from it. This is especially true for people living in the city, where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs. In the present there is a lack of respect for animals. Being able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve.The reason why most people oppose to zoos is that in some of them the animals are not very well taken care of and they do not have good and clean facilities. This is mostly true but does not relate to the purpose of zoos. It would be great if every zoo kept the animals in perfect conditions, but regardless of the condition, zoos are very useful.;I take issue with the assertion that zoos lack a meaningful purpose. While there are arguments suggesting that they are antiquated and inhumane, I contend that zoos are crucial for conservation, education, and research. Firstly, zoos offer a secure and monitored environment for endangered species to flourish, facilitating breeding programs and the eventual reintroduction of these species into their natural habitats. A prime example is the California Condor Recovery Program, initiated in the 1980s, which has significantly increased the population of this critically endangered bird, largely due to the involvement of zoos.Additionally, zoos function as vital educational platforms, allowing the public to learn about and connect with wildlife. By observing and engaging with animals in a zoo context, visitors can develop a greater understanding and appreciation for the natural world. This experience often fosters a sense of love and respect for wildlife, which can lead to increased conservation efforts and inspire individuals to take action to protect endangered species and their ecosystems.Furthermore, zoos participate in various research initiatives that enhance our knowledge of animal behavior, physiology, and ecology. The insights gained from these studies help shape conservation strategies and enhance animal welfare, both in captivity and in the wild. Many zoos are actively engaged in research related to animal nutrition, enrichment, and habitat design, all aimed at improving the quality of life for animals.In summary, I firmly reject the notion that zoos serve no useful purpose. They play a fundamental role in conservation, education, and research, with their contributions being invaluable. While some zoos may not adhere to contemporary standards of animal care and welfare, many are committed to ensuring the well-being of animals and protecting global biodiversity.
173;Some movies are serious, designed to make the audience think. Other movies are designed primarily to amuse and entertain. Which type of movie do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"I prefer the serious movies which are simple, touching and powerful. Here are my reasons. First, most serious movies have a wide variety of content. Entertaining movies are created to amuse people. However, most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical. Compared with the entertainment film, the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful. Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love, humaneness; moreover, it may point out the dark sides of the society.Second, not all of serious movies are boring. ""Click"" is a very interesting comedy, with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses. The movie is humorous and satiric,which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives, and it reminds us how important our families are. Thus, the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves.Moreover, some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world. ""Blood diamond"", an adaptation of a real story in South Africa, focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict. After watching the movie, we may learn a lesson between jewels and death. Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love; indeed, the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality. As a result, serious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way.For the above reasons, I prefer to see those serious movies which make people have deep thoughts toward their real lives.";"I have always been captivated by films that encourage deep contemplation. Known as thought-provoking or intellectual cinema, these serious movies resonate with me on a profound level. I favor them over lighter, more entertaining films for several reasons.For one, serious films often address intricate themes and real-world challenges, enhancing their relatability and impact. Movies like ""12 Years a Slave"" and ""Schindler's List"" illuminate pivotal historical events and social injustices, prompting viewers to examine their own morals and beliefs. These films not only educate but also foster empathy and understanding.Additionally, I appreciate that serious movies frequently present complex characters and storylines, which keep me engaged and emotionally invested. Films such as ""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"" exemplify this, with their layered plots and exploration of philosophical questions. They stimulate my intellect and encourage critical thinking about the themes explored.Conversely, while lighthearted films can certainly be enjoyable, they often lack depth and fail to leave a lasting impact. After watching a purely entertaining movie, I typically forget the plot and characters quickly, reducing the experience to temporary amusement. In contrast, serious films linger long after the credits roll, evoking thoughts and sparking meaningful discussions. Ultimately, my preference for serious cinema arises from its capacity to educate, challenge, and inspire, making for a more fulfilling and unforgettable viewing experience."
174;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines, and other media pay too much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;As a mass media majoring student, I think that it's true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society. In my point of view, disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages. My reasons include the following:It is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people. The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip. However, journalism is changing. Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues, paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people.First of all, gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion. The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports, which seems to tell a story. Moreover, it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported.Furthermore, sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems. The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content, which can attract the audience. Thus, these personal reports of famous people, unimportant information or distorted stories, will not solve problem related with the society. In other words, yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news, such as education, environment and public issues.Based on the above discussion, I agree with that paying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem.;I wholeheartedly concur with the viewpoint that the media devotes excessive attention to the private lives of public figures and celebrities. The relentless surveillance and breach of their personal spaces have become ingrained in today's media landscape. It appears that every action they take, every relationship they enter, and every blunder they make is fodder for news outlets.One key factor contributing to this disproportionate focus is the unquenchable public thirst for gossip and scandal. The media satisfies this appetite by plastering sensational stories across the front pages of newspapers and magazines while dedicating extensive airtime to celebrity news on television. Consequently, the public faces an overwhelming influx of trivial information and rumors regarding the personal lives of prominent individuals, often overshadowing more significant and relevant news stories.Moreover, this undue emphasis on celebrity culture can have harmful repercussions, both for the individuals involved and for society at large. It can foster an unhealthy obsession with fame and materialism while diverting attention from more urgent issues that deserve public focus and engagement. For example, while the media is preoccupied with analyzing the latest celebrity romance or conflict, it may neglect its duty to cover critical social, economic, and political matters that impact people's lives.In summary, the media's fixation on the personal lives of celebrities is a misguided trend that ultimately does more harm than good. Instead of indulging in frivolous gossip and speculation, the media should prioritize delivering insightful and informative journalism that enriches and educates the public. This shift would foster a more balanced and nuanced understanding of current events and encourage more constructive and meaningful public dialogue.
175;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As a lover of travel, a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour, which can be explained by the following reasons.Primary, it is easy to know the history of the new place. Last year, I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum, where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York. Through the exhibit, I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom, and Ellis Island may be the place, where the immigration took their dreams and fears. Thus, museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place.Secondary, visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon. Those outstanding and diverse range of objects,with classic and magnificent art, is guaranteed to inspire us! In my city, National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts. To my astonishment, Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work, which is made of jade, is vividly shown.Moreover, a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit. Someone take a trip without making any plans, so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel. As a result, visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision. Most important of all, a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time.For the above reasons, if we have a chance to visit top museums in the world, we must stop by these museums. During our trip, it is worthwhile for us to visit a museum of a new place.;When exploring new places, many travelers often consider visiting museums an essential element of their plans. I believe there are several compelling reasons why people choose to explore these cultural venues. Firstly, the main draw is the opportunity to understand the local culture, history, and heritage of their destination. Museums act as repositories of a region's past, exhibiting artifacts, artworks, and relics that tell the story of its inhabitants and their traditions. For instance, the Louvre Museum in Paris attracts countless tourists eager to view the Mona Lisa and other iconic French works, allowing them to immerse themselves in the essence of French culture.Another important reason for museum visits is educational. Museums provide a distinctive learning environment where visitors can interact with engaging exhibits, take guided tours, and participate in workshops that make complex ideas more understandable and enjoyable. A prime example is the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C., which draws millions of visitors each year interested in the marvels of aviation and space exploration. This experience not only piques the curiosity of adults but also ignites a passion for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in young minds.Lastly, many people are drawn to museums simply to experience art and beauty. Art museums, in particular, offer a calm and inspiring atmosphere where visitors can admire the creativity and skill of artists from diverse cultures. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, with its extensive collection spanning over 5,000 years, exemplifies this, inviting people to appreciate the masterpieces born from human creativity and imagination.In summary, visiting museums is a fundamental aspect of travel, as it enables individuals to engage with local culture, gain knowledge, and appreciate the aesthetic and historical importance of various artworks and artifacts. Whether for educational enrichment, cultural exploration, or pure enjoyment, museums are indeed captivating destinations that enhance one’s travel experience.
176;In the future, students may have the choice of studying at home by using technology such as computer or television or studying or traditional school? Which would you prefer? Use specific details to explain your choice.;"I don't think that technology can replace teachers and classroom. Here are my reasons. Studying at home by using technology is convenient. The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day. In addition, you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course. You can study any time you want. However, if you aren't extremely dedicated or have good time management skills, it may be very difficult to complete a course at home.First, attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience. Especially when you don't have an instructor there to guide you, it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements. Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects. Unfortunately, it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help. Second, studying at home is very different from traditional learning. Unlike traditional classes, distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates. Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision. If you are the type that gets easily distracted, a distance-learning program may not be for you.Furthermore, there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization- establishes relationship with classmates. We can learn a lot from programs at home; however, our computers or televisions can't teach us how to get along with people. For example, students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork. Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities. For the above reasons, I agree that distance education can't replace traditional school.";The rise of technology has significantly changed the way we approach learning. In the future, students may choose to study from home through computers or televisions, or they may opt for traditional schooling. While home-based learning provides flexibility and convenience, I strongly believe that traditional education is the superior choice.Firstly, traditional schools create a structured and disciplined atmosphere that promotes both learning and personal development. Within a classroom, students can engage with teachers and fellow classmates, ask questions, and participate in discussions, all of which deepen their comprehension of challenging subjects. Moreover, conventional schools offer a diverse array of extracurricular activities, sports, and clubs that nurture essential life skills, including teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.On the other hand, studying from home may lack the vital social interaction and human connections necessary for emotional and psychological growth. Although technology supplies an abundance of information, it falls short in substituting the guidance and support provided by teachers, who offer valuable feedback, encouragement, and motivation. Additionally, remote learning can lead to distractions, procrastination, and a lack of accountability, which may adversely affect academic success.Traditional schools also cultivate a sense of community and belonging, which is crucial for students' emotional and mental health. They learn important social competencies such as empathy, cooperation, and conflict resolution, skills that are indispensable for both personal and professional achievements. In conclusion, although home learning offers convenience, I contend that traditional education provides a more comprehensive and well-rounded experience that equips students for success in various aspects of life. Therefore, I would choose to study in a conventional school environment, where I can interact with teachers and peers, engage in extracurricular activities, and develop essential life skills.
177;It has recently been announced that a large shopping center may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;I believe that it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community. The following are my reasons.In the first place, the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping. Here is a positive example: Queens Center Mall, a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City, provides a wide vairtey of stores, products and services, from clothing to electronics and restaurants, that consumers can choose. It is widely thought that it is one of the most productive malls in New York. I found that I could find virtually every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney, when I visited there. As far as I am concerned, a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time.Furthermore, it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs. There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall. It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job. Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money.Lastly, it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center, and save our time on the other hand. There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers. Accordingly, with sales promotion, it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy. In addition, the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes.For the above-mentioned reasons, I advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to our community.;The announcement of a new large shopping center in our neighborhood has ignited a passionate debate among residents. After thorough reflection, I stand firmly against this proposal. First and foremost, the construction of such a vast complex will lead to an alarming increase in traffic congestion in our area. We are already grappling with heavy traffic, and the influx of shoppers and delivery vehicles will only intensify the issue, making it increasingly difficult for residents to navigate the streets.Furthermore, the shopping center will destroy valuable green spaces and natural habitats. Our community is cherished for its lovely parks and gardens, which offer a tranquil retreat for residents. The loss of these spaces would not only harm the environment but also detract from the charm of our neighborhood. Additionally, the shopping center is likely to threaten the existence of small, local businesses that are the heart of our community. The arrival of large chain stores could undermine our neighborhood's unique character and displace the very businesses that make it vibrant.Finally, I am troubled by the potential for noise pollution and disruption to residents’ daily lives. The construction phase will be noisy and disruptive, while the operation of the shopping center will create significant noise and light pollution. This is especially concerning for residents who appreciate the quiet ambiance of our neighborhood. In summary, although the proposal for a new shopping center may seem attractive, I believe that the negative impacts far outweigh any potential benefits. I urge local authorities to reconsider this plan and seek alternative solutions that prioritize the well-being and quality of life for our community.
178;What is a very important skill a person should learn in order to be successful in the world today? Choose one skill and use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;"Some people think that life is a struggle, which means we may encounter numerous difficulties during our lives. Accordingly, stress management, how to survive our unbearable stress, is the most important skill that we should have. Here are my reasons. Stress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences. Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success. However, it is widely thought that we experience stress any time, which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals. As a result, if we don't have a good stress management skill, it may lead to some critical problems.In the frenetic, fast-paced world, it is a very common predicament that all of us, from the young to the senior, feel depressed caused by stress, such as financial problems, exam stress, relationship difficulties and work overload. Some people regard stress as a power, which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best; other people cannot charge of their thoughts, emotions, and the way they deal with problems. Therefore, stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization.Furthermore, stress takes a toll on our health. It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles, frustrations, and demands. This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress. Thus, some people have physical problems, such as insomnia and headaches. Melancholia, the most fatal problem, even leads some people to commit suicide. Consequently, it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body. To avoid being a pessimist, we may try to conquer our distress by sharing our worry with friends or families, doing exercise regularly, and trying to see our troubles in a different way.For the above reasons, I believe that stress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress.";In today’s rapidly changing and interconnected environment, mastering effective communication is a crucial skill for achieving success. The ability to express thoughts, ideas, and opinions clearly and concisely is essential in both personal and professional realms. Proficient communication fosters the development of strong relationships, facilitates negotiation, and aids conflict resolution, all of which contribute to overall success.For example, in the workplace, strong communication skills are vital for effective teamwork, leadership, and client interactions. A manager who clearly communicates expectations and delivers constructive feedback can inspire employees and boost productivity. Likewise, in personal relationships, effective communication prevents misunderstandings, helps resolve conflicts, and promotes deeper emotional connections. In our globalized world, the ability to navigate cultural and language differences makes communication even more valuable.Additionally, with the increase in digital interactions, expressing oneself effectively through writing—such as emails, reports, and social media—is becoming increasingly important. Many professions rely heavily on written communication, and those who can write clearly and persuasively gain a distinct advantage. For instance, a marketing expert who crafts compelling messages can drive sales and enhance brand presence, while a journalist capable of writing engaging articles can shape and inform public opinion.In summary, developing effective communication skills is essential for success in today’s world. It strengthens personal and professional relationships, enhances teamwork and leadership, and creates wider opportunities in a digital and global context. By honing their communication abilities, individuals can articulate their ideas more clearly, forge stronger connections, and achieve their objectives more efficiently. Therefore, prioritizing this invaluable skill is essential for anyone aiming to make a significant impact in their field.
179;Groups or organizations are an important part of some people's lives. Why are groups or organizations important to people? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;"During our life, it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations; therefore, groups and organizations are an important part of their lives. In my point of view, groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals. My reasons include the following:In the first place, humans are a part of the society, and the society includes a wide variety of groups. Most of all, the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults. We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life. By making teamwork, the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others. As university students, it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others. After graduating from schools, employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits. Thus, almost of us live in the environment of groups.By participating in an organization, it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose. A solid group can be a suited environment, which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons. For example, as a student majoring in mass media, I have taken part in mass media student group for a year. When being in the department of art, I have not only learned how to do a project, but also known some famous artists during the term. Above all, it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job.Furthermore, groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal. Here is an example: there are various charities in the world. Tzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan, is famous for contributing to the social and community services, and medical care. They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit. For accomplishing their missions, the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks. As a result, they lit the light for the poor and victims; in addition, they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world. For the above reasons and examples, it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds.";"Groups and organizations are crucial to the lives of many individuals, providing a sense of belonging, support, and purpose. These collective entities hold significance for various reasons. Firstly, they create opportunities for like-minded individuals to unite and explore shared interests. For example, participating in a book club or a sports team allows members to engage in activities they are passionate about while cultivating social connections and friendships.Furthermore, groups and organizations often act as a source of emotional support and guidance. Support groups, such as those for individuals facing mental health challenges or chronic illnesses, create a safe environment where people can share their experiences and receive encouragement from those who relate to their struggles. This sense of community and companionship can be incredibly empowering, assisting individuals in coping with difficulties and overcoming hurdles.Additionally, these entities offer avenues for personal growth and development. Take professional associations, for instance; they provide training, workshops, and networking opportunities that help members enhance their skills, stay informed about industry trends, and advance in their careers. Similarly, volunteer groups and charitable organizations allow individuals to contribute to meaningful causes, fostering a sense of purpose and fulfillment.In summary, groups and organizations are fundamental to people's lives, as they provide belonging, support, and opportunities for development. Whether it's a social club, a support group, or a professional association, these collective entities unite individuals, offering platforms for connection, learning, and contribution. Being part of a group or organization empowers individuals to broaden their social circles, acquire new skills, and discover meaning in their lives. Ultimately, the significance of these groups and organizations lies in their ability to enrich lives, cultivating a sense of community and shared experience."
180;The government has announced that it plans to build a new university. Some people think that your community would be a good place to locate the university. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a new university in your community. Use specific details in your discussion;I will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community. There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies, creation of jobs. However, they come together with some disadvantages such as social problems.This new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study. For example, suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family. If you would like to attend a business school, you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university. He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community's university.Undoubtedly, the university will have to hire professors, employees and etc. Thus, a number vacant positions need to be filled. Also there will be more opportunities to work in the community. Moreover, when people have jobs, they will have money to spend on goods and services. This can also help stimulate the local economy. However, building the university may lead to some social problems. A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university. When many people congregate in one place, I think that some kinds of social problems will follow. Traffic may worsen. More wastes have to be managed. Maybe crime rate will also increase. These social problems may impair the quality of life in the community. In sum, I myself agree with the plan to build the university. I believe the benefit from it will outweigh the cost. However, it would be indispensable that the government conduct a survey about the community opinion on the new university first.;The government's recent announcement to establish a new university has ignited a vigorous discussion regarding its potential location. Our community has been identified as a leading contender, and while there are several benefits associated with this development, there are also notable drawbacks. On the positive side, the creation of a university in our area would generate numerous job opportunities for local residents, not only during construction but also once the university opens its doors. This would stimulate the local economy and help lower unemployment rates.Additionally, a new university would draw a diverse group of students and faculty, enhancing the cultural fabric of the community. The arrival of young, educated individuals could foster innovation and entrepreneurship, paving the way for new businesses and startups. Plus, the university would offer local students access to higher education facilities, allowing them to study closer to home.Conversely, there are significant disadvantages to consider. The building of a new university could result in increased traffic and congestion, potentially disturbing the calm atmosphere of our community. The heightened demand for housing and services might drive up living costs, which could displace long-time residents. Furthermore, the pressure on local resources—such as water and energy—could become problematic, particularly if the university's infrastructure is not designed with sustainability in mind.In summary, while the prospect of a new university in our community offers several appealing benefits, including job creation and cultural enrichment, it also raises critical concerns related to traffic, affordability, and resource management. Thorough planning and careful consideration of these issues are crucial to ensure that the advantages of the university outweigh its challenges and that it serves as a valuable and sustainable asset for our community.
181;While some pelple believe that the government should provide a college education free to any citizen who wants it, others beleve that it is up to the individual to finance his/her own education.Ê;"Some people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college. However, I believe that individuals should pay their college tuition because it would cost too much, the college education is a personal's choice, and there are many ways to fund a college education. First, making college education free would cost too much. It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement, infrastructure and so forth. There are many other needs which should come first, such as providing health care to all American, or improving public schools. In addition, it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education. Consequently, it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds. Second, it is a personal choice to go to a college. Not everyone wants to go to a college. People who want to make more money, and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education. Therefore, those people should make the financial investment in their own choice; not the government.Third, there are many ways to fund a college education. People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship, financial aids, and other funds. In addition, the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means. They often provide services such as fire departments, medical assistance, and police protection for the schools and their students. They also provide funds for academic research. While the money is not given to individual students, these contributions are not trivial. In short, the individual should finance his or her education because it is a personal choice. Otherwise, it would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the government.";The ongoing discussion about who should cover the expenses of a college education has persisted for many years. Some argue that the government ought to provide free college education to any citizen wishing to pursue it, while others contend that individuals should be responsible for funding their own education. In this essay, I will advocate for government financial support to enhance access to higher education for citizens.On one side of the debate, advocates for free college education point out numerous advantages for both individuals and society at large. Such a policy could foster a more educated and skilled workforce, positively impacting the nation's economic growth and global competitiveness. Additionally, eliminating financial barriers to higher education can help diminish income inequality, offering equal opportunities for individuals from diverse backgrounds. This can ultimately cultivate a more informed and engaged citizenry, which is vital for a robust democracy.Conversely, some maintain that individuals should take on the responsibility of financing their education. They argue that this sense of personal investment will lead people to value their education more and make thoughtful choices regarding their studies. However, this perspective overlooks the reality that not everyone has the financial means to pursue higher education. Many students are forced to incur substantial debt to fund their education, which can pose a long-term financial burden.In conclusion, while both arguments hold merit, I contend that the government should offer financial assistance to make college education more accessible to its citizens. By doing so, it can contribute to the development of a more educated and skilled workforce, alleviate income inequality, and enhance social mobility. Ultimately, investing in free or low-cost college education is a strategic investment in the nation's future, yielding significant long-term benefits for individuals, society, and the economy.
182;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"We all know that television provides us many benefits; it helps people relax, helps keep up with news, helps broad our mind. However, have you ever thought that television has destroyed communication among friends and family? I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us.First of all, since people watch television too much, they can be isolated from others. Children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others. Gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying.Secondly, with the rapid change of the standard of life, each family has three or four TV in each room is more common. Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room. As a consequence, children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents. Moreover, parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children. In this way, communication between family members is visibly destroyed.Last but not least, watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human. For example, watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing. What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does? is this one of the reason cause division in society?In conclusion, though television has some good sides, it has destroyed communication among friends and family. We need to quickly find the way to address this problem as soon as possible and the first concern is to reducing violent behaviors that children learn from television.";I challenge the notion that television has undermined communication among friends and family. While it's true that too much TV can decrease face-to-face interactions, the connection between television and communication is far more nuanced. In reality, television can act as a catalyst for communication and strengthening bonds within relationships.For example, enjoying a favorite show or movie together can create a shared topic for conversation. Families often come together to watch sporting events or popular award shows, using these moments to connect and create lasting memories. Additionally, television offers a shared cultural experience, allowing people to engage in discussions about the latest episodes of trending shows or to debate current events featured in news programs.Moreover, television serves as an educational resource, promoting communication and discussion. Documentaries, historical dramas, and educational series can ignite engaging conversations and debates among family and friends, fostering critical thinking and analysis. Thanks to modern technology, viewers can now share the TV-watching experience even from afar, using platforms like Netflix Party or social media to enjoy shows together while discussing their impressions in real time.In summary, while excessive television consumption can indeed harm communication, it is misleading to claim that television has obliterated communication among friends and family. On the contrary, when used judiciously, television can enhance communication, nurture relationships, and offer shared experiences. In moderation, television can enrich our social interactions.
183;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Attending a live performance (a play, concert, sporting event, etc) is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Have you ever traveled along to support your home football team during tournaments? Have you attended at a stadium to watch your team's match, yell or even cry with the team and their thousands of fans there? If you have a great love with football and your home team, it is much more gratifying to stay side by side and cheer up the team at the stadium rather than just to stay at home and watch the match alone.First, attending a live football match is very fulfilling. Before the match starts, thousands of fans gathering outside of the stadium with team flags, colorful outfits, sound of trumpets and rattles... everywhere. As the game kicks off, the atmosphere inside the stadium is even more exciting. You are watching football stars play the game with your own eyes and sharing your feelings with about 40,000 people at the stadium, such an excitement you can never have when you are watching it at home. Everybody yells and sings together, the stadium is like bursted out whenever a goal is scored. See, you will be bored if you are watching it alone.Second, watching a live football game is an exceptional experience. You can watch it at home, but ""easy come, easy go"", you will quickly forget it, like a movie. The tickets to get in the stadium may be a little expensive, but you will gain much more entertainment value from the game. You can cherish your experience for a long time. Furthermore, it can be an exclusive experience. If it is a crucial win to acclaim a trophy, you will be ""on site"" to witness and celebrate the victory.In conclusion, watch a football match on television it is comfortable and pleasing, but watching the match live at the stadium is more enjoyable. It can be unforgettable moments in your life.";I firmly believe that experiencing a live performance is far more enjoyable than watching the same event on television, and there are several reasons underpinning this view. First and foremost, the atmosphere and energy of a live event are truly unmatched. Attending a concert, theater production, or sports game in person allows one to feel the excitement and enthusiasm of the crowd, creating an electric ambiance that television simply cannot replicate. For instance, being at a music festival like Coachella or Lollapalooza offers fans a singular opportunity to connect with their favorite artists and fellow music enthusiasts in a way that no live stream or recording can replicate.Additionally, live performances foster a genuine sense of community and shared experience. When attending a live event, spectators are surrounded by others who share their passion for the performance, which fosters camaraderie and collective excitement. This is especially noticeable at sporting events, where the collective roar of the crowd and the palpable thrill of victory or defeat transform the experience into something dynamic and engaging.Moreover, live performances often provide a more immersive and interactive experience than watching at home. In a theater, for example, the audience is intimately engaged with the actors, experiencing the drama and emotion of the performance firsthand. In contrast, viewing the same play on television can feel remote and disconnected, lacking the richness of a live experience. Ultimately, attending a live performance delivers a unique and exhilarating experience that far surpasses the enjoyment of watching the same event on TV. The vibrancy, sense of community, and immersion of a live event create an exceptional experience that is truly unforgettable.
184;Renewable resources of energy (Sun, wind, water) will soon replace fossils fuels such as gases, oil, and coal. Do you agree or disagree?;"Although renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy, as far as I'm concerned, these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal.Firstly, due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive. Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford. On the other hand, fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas. For example, it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms. Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming.Besides, although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think. Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards. For example, the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams. This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds. More importantly, the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations. Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think.Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions. For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain. These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy. With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable.In conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound, there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon.";For centuries, fossil fuels—such as natural gas, oil, and coal—have been the backbone of global energy consumption. However, growing concerns about climate change and environmental damage have accelerated the movement toward renewable energy sources. I strongly believe that resources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power will soon become the dominant forms of energy.To begin with, advancements in technology have made renewable energy not only more efficient but also more affordable, positioning it as a competitive alternative to fossil fuels. For example, the significant drop in solar panel prices has enabled both households and businesses to embrace solar energy. Additionally, innovations in wind turbine design have enhanced energy output, solidifying wind power's role as an important component of the international energy landscape.Furthermore, the environmental advantages of renewable energy vastly outshine those associated with fossil fuels. Burning fossil fuels releases harmful greenhouse gases, driving climate change and causing air pollution. In contrast, renewable sources are inherently clean, generating minimal to zero emissions, which makes them a far more sustainable choice. As global awareness of the need to reduce carbon footprints grows, both governments and corporations are making substantial investments in renewable energy infrastructure.Finally, numerous nations have established ambitious goals for transitioning to renewable energy, and many are already showing impressive progress. For instance, Norway and Costa Rica are on the verge of reaching 100% energy sustainability, while countries like China and the United States are significantly investing in solar and wind technologies. As the appetite for renewable energy rises, costs are expected to fall, increasing accessibility for people worldwide. In conclusion, given the strides in technology, the environmental benefits, and robust government initiatives, I am confident that renewable energy sources will soon take the lead over fossil fuels as the primary energy source.
185;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree this point of view? Why or why not. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important. The reasons are based on the following aspects.First, land used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society. There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy, because they produce plenty of profits. What is more, the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry. It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate. Thus the needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.Second, farmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life. It is clearly understood that farming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live. Especially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing. In addition, highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life. Last I want to mention is that even though farmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals, it can do good to protect the endangered animals. According to the discuss above, agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy. With the economy development, we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals. For instant, we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct.All in all, protecting endangered animals is necessary, nevertheless, human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.;I firmly contest the perspective that the demands of farmland, housing, and industrial development outweigh the importance of preserving land for endangered species. While it is undeniable that humans need land for various activities, safeguarding endangered animals is essential for the delicate balance of our ecosystem. The erosion of biodiversity can lead to grave and lasting repercussions, including habitat loss and the disruption of food webs.Additionally, many endangered species are crucial for maintaining environmental health. For instance, bees are vital for pollination, and their decline can have catastrophic impacts on agricultural yields. Similarly, wolves play a critical role in regulating prey populations, thereby preventing overgrazing and sustaining the quality of plant life. By conserving land for these species, we are ultimately protecting the long-term viability of our own food resources and ecosystems.Moreover, the notion that human needs and environmental conservation cannot coexist is a misleading simplification. In many instances, sustainable land-use practices can satisfy human demands while simultaneously protecting endangered species. Approaches like agroforestry and permaculture can provide nourishment and income for local communities while preserving biodiversity. Additionally, eco-tourism can foster economic growth and job creation while promoting the conservation of natural habitats.In summary, reserving land for endangered animals is not merely a luxury, but an essential requirement. Preserving biodiversity is crucial for ensuring the vitality of our planet, and it is our duty to meet human needs in a sustainable and environmentally responsible way. By implementing sustainable land-use techniques and focusing on conservation, we can fulfill human requirements while also safeguarding the natural world for future generations.
186;Some people think that learning a foreign language in its original country is more beneficial than learning the language in a countr with another language. Do you agree or disagree?;Although there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country, I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries.Person 'A' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method. In other words, he is not jumping into the foreign country. Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language. Besides, all the learners are probably from the same country, so all these people most likely have learned the language, more or less, in the same way.On the other hand, when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken, he has the opportunity to communicate with natives. He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country. No doubt, it leads to better understanding of language essential skills. He also has access to the most up-to-date language. Thus he can learn most useful idioms, proverbs and so many other things which the former person, person 'A', does not have access to.On the whole, if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel, I would definitely make the second choice. There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language. When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language, you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible.In a word, although each of these methods have their pros and cons, I am pretty sure that advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language.;The discussion surrounding the optimal environment for acquiring a foreign language has gained considerable interest in recent years. Some proponents advocate for learning a language in its native country, while others highlight the challenges and disadvantages of this method. In this essay, I will contend that studying a foreign language in its country of origin offers greater advantages than learning it in a country where another language predominates.To begin with, immersing oneself in the original country of the language fosters a rich environment conducive to language acquisition. Being surrounded by native speakers, authentic resources, and cultural practices greatly enriches the learning process, enabling students to grasp the nuances and intricacies of the language that might be overlooked in a non-native environment. For example, mastering Spanish in Spain or Mandarin in China provides unparalleled opportunities to interact with the language in real-life scenarios, such as ordering meals, navigating transit systems, or participating in local celebrations.Moreover, learning a foreign language in its homeland allows for the simultaneous development of cultural understanding alongside linguistic skills. Exposure to the community’s customs, traditions, and values equips learners with a deeper appreciation of the language's context, promoting a more genuine style of communication. As a result, this cultural immersion enhances their capacity to engage effectively with native speakers and build meaningful connections.In summary, despite some initial challenges of learning a foreign language in its original country—like culture shock or adapting to a new environment—the advantages considerably overshadow the downsides. The immersive atmosphere, cultural exposure, and genuine learning experiences make studying a foreign language in its native setting far more effective and fulfilling than in a different linguistic context. Therefore, I firmly believe that learning a foreign language in its original country is the most advantageous strategy for language learners.
187;Some people say that physical exercise should be required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with?;"Although some people believe that students should spend the whole day on academic studies, I nevertheless believe that physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day. Exercise is good not only for having a good health body, but also for the mind. In addition, including exercise in children's daily routine, it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age.Physical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier. As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year, it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school. In addition, exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular, higher blood and cholesterol issues.Daily exercise will help also to develop children's brain function. It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better. When people exercise, the respiratory system's function is enhanced, helping all organs, including the brain, to get more oxygen in. Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners.Having children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine. Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity; however, they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice. Moreover, they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life. Including physical activity in children's school day should be strongly considered. It will meliorate not only mental and body health, but also will establish in children a habit of doing it, giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules.";The discussion surrounding the necessity of physical exercise as a compulsory element of the school day versus the exclusive focus on academic studies has sparked significant debate. I am convinced that physical exercise should be an integral part of every school day.The advantages of physical exercise for students are extensive, including better physical health, enhanced mental well-being, and increased focus during classes. Regular participation in physical activity is linked to a lower risk of obesity, diabetes, and other health-related issues, which sets the foundation for a healthier lifestyle. In addition, exercise has been demonstrated to enhance cognitive function, elevate mood, and alleviate stress—factors that are critically important for academic achievement. By integrating physical exercise into the daily school schedule, students are likely to be more engaged, energized, and driven to learn.On the other hand, dedicating the entire school day to academic pursuits can lead to burnout, diminished motivation, and insufficient physical activity. While academic studies are vital, excessively prioritizing them can create an imbalance in students' overall development. Physical exercise serves as an essential break from academic demands, enabling students to recharge and return to their studies with renewed enthusiasm and productivity.Additionally, incorporating physical exercise into the daily curriculum fosters teamwork, discipline, and social interaction. Engaging in team sports and physical activities encourages collaboration, relationship-building, and the development of crucial life skills such as communication, problem-solving, and time management.In summary, I wholeheartedly believe that physical exercise should be a mandatory part of every school day. The multitude of benefits arising from physical activity—including improved physical and mental health, enhanced academic performance, and strengthened social skills—make it an indispensable aspect of a comprehensive education. By weaving physical exercise into the school routine, we can cultivate healthier, happier, and more well-rounded students.
188;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In my opinion, it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students. Although, many argue that it provide good working experience, but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways. Having jobs would affect the health of the student. It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life.A student has to do lots of studies in today's competitive world to prove himself. He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades. If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time, then it would cause an extra burden on them. Furthermore, jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on. This would result in stress, tension and tiredness. They won't be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep. Thus, would affect their mental and physical health.Another reason, jobs can divert students from their studies. If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money. They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money. This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies. Moreover, they drop out their studies so as to earn more money.In addition to this, the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time. He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends, clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others. They have whole life to do job and prove themselves, but the childhood phase will never return in their life. Therefore, they should take advantage of life as much possible they can.Thus, for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies. Having job would affect their health, divert them from studies and take away one of the important phase from their life.;The idea of teenagers working while they are still in school is a widespread occurrence in many parts of the world. I believe this practice offers significant advantages for young people. First and foremost, having a job enables teenagers to acquire important work experience and cultivate vital skills such as time management, effective communication, and teamwork. These competencies are essential for their future careers and can enhance their competitiveness in the job market.Furthermore, balancing work and study fosters greater independence and responsibility among teenagers. They learn to manage their finances, prioritize their tasks, and juggle both work and academic responsibilities. This sense of accountability can extend to other aspects of their lives, including personal relationships and individual goals. Additionally, a job can instill a sense of purpose and drive, which may lead to better academic performance and a stronger work ethic.However, it is crucial to consider the nature of the job and the number of hours worked. Teenagers should not be subjected to excessive workloads or exploitation, and their employment should not disrupt their academic responsibilities. Ideally, part-time jobs or internships that align with their studies can be particularly beneficial. In summary, working while studying can be an excellent opportunity for teenagers to gain valuable experience, develop critical skills, and foster independence and responsibility. As long as they can maintain a balance with their educational commitments, I strongly believe that this approach can positively influence their future careers and personal development.
189;Some people believe that zoos serve useful function. Other people believe that it's cruel & wrong to confine animals in zoos. Tell which point of view you are agree with.;It has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos. Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment. Over the time, there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals.Some people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos. First of all, zoos are fascinating places of entertainment. For this point, they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure. Another function that all zoos serve relates to education. Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world. Moreover, some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct.On the other hand, there are, however, people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals. Being confined, animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented. In their opinion, zoos are some kind of prisons and it's so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons.From my point of view, I agree with the first group. In modern life, zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers. Besides, recently, zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature, taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity.;The discussion surrounding the role of zoos in society has ignited passionate debate, with some advocating for their benefits while others argue that keeping animals in captivity is inhumane. After thoughtful reflection, I align myself with the latter perspective, believing that it is indeed cruel and wrong to confine animals in zoos.To begin with, zoos create environments that are fundamentally unnatural for wildlife. Animals are removed from their natural ecosystems and placed in restricted, artificial enclosures, which can lead to stress, boredom, and various behavioral issues. This situation can severely impact their physical and mental well-being, and it is unacceptable to prioritize human amusement over the welfare of these creatures.Moreover, many zoos are unable to offer the necessary space and stimulation that animals require to flourish. Often, they are small and lack the resources needed to provide adequate care, resulting in substandard living conditions and neglect. This inadequacy can manifest in harmful behaviors, such as pacing or self-harming, which are clear signs of distress.Additionally, as technology advances and conservation initiatives improve, there are now more effective and compassionate alternatives for learning about and protecting wildlife. Options like wildlife documentaries, national parks, and conservation centers enable people to appreciate animals in their natural settings without the ethical issues tied to captivity.In summary, while some may contend that zoos have educational and conservation value, I strongly believe that the negative impact of confining animals far outweighs any perceived benefits. We have a moral obligation to prioritize animal welfare and to treat all creatures with respect and kindness, rather than exploiting them for our entertainment. Thus, I firmly stand by the conviction that it is cruel and wrong to keep animals in zoos.
190;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;When I found the chance of studying in a group with my classmates, I wished I can go back in time and took all my exams again. I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features, getting help from other students, improving my attitude for learning, managing my time in an effective way.When pupils make a group for studying, all member of group have the same chance to help each other. They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course. For example, when a group faces with complex math problem, they can share their opinions to solve it. In addition, such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group. Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying. In a group of student, the best of those always encourages others to study harder. Besides, pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group. Clearly, better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements. When the students study with their friends, they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner. Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time, inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time. Therefore, time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying. In conclusion, I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of some important opportunities gaining with this activity. I can receive some helps from other student as well as improving my learning skills, also managing of time is another achievements of group-studying. Now, it is time to start without any regret from my previous exams.;When it comes to studying, people have varying preferences. Some students thrive in solo study environments, while others do better in group settings. Personally, I prefer studying with a group of peers, as I find that collaborative learning offers numerous advantages.First and foremost, group study encourages the sharing of knowledge and ideas. Each member contributes their unique insights and understanding of the material, which often leads to a more thorough comprehension of the subject. For example, during a group study session, one person might explain a challenging concept in a way that resonates with others, enhancing everyone's grasp of the topic.Additionally, studying in groups fosters a sense of healthy competition and motivation. Being surrounded by peers who are also committed to learning creates an atmosphere where everyone is inspired to perform at their best. This shared enthusiasm can serve as a powerful motivator, helping individuals stay focused and actively pursue their academic ambitions.Another notable benefit of group studying is the opportunity to cultivate essential teamwork and communication skills. Collaborating to tackle problems or complete assignments teaches students how to express their ideas clearly, listen actively, and work together towards a common objective. These skills are not only valuable in academic settings but are also crucial in professional and personal contexts.In summary, while studying alone has its merits, I strongly believe that group study offers a more engaging and enriching learning experience. The exchange of ideas, the motivation that comes from collective effort, and the development of important life skills all contribute to making group study an effective approach to achieving academic success.
191;Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Other choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Compare the advantages of each choice. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons to support your answers.;Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man's life, people might have different preferences: some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends, while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends. In my view, I prefer the second attitude.The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others' experiences. For instance, among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport, or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before. Of course, while differences give the opportunity to learn, they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement. This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends. In fact, in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same.Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded. For example, if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice, your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages.When you have just few close friends, on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more, but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours, adding less to your experience.In sum, although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points, I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life.;Socializing preferences vary widely among individuals. Some people find joy in the company of a few close friends, while others flourish within larger groups filled with acquaintances. Each approach has its own set of benefits.On one hand, spending time with a small circle of close friends fosters deeper, more meaningful connections. With fewer people to engage with, conversations can become more personal and profound, enhancing trust and camaraderie. Furthermore, smaller gatherings tend to be better organized, resulting in less stress and more enjoyment. For instance, close friends can seamlessly coordinate a weekend trip or an intimate dinner, providing a wonderful opportunity to unwind and strengthen their bonds.On the other hand, a larger circle of friends offers a broader array of social experiences and opportunities. The diversity in interests, hobbies, and personalities among a bigger group can create a lively and exciting social environment. Moreover, a larger network can foster a sense of belonging and support, giving individuals more resources to lean on during challenging times. For example, a big group can orchestrate a vibrant celebration or an adventurous outing, which can be quite exhilarating.Personally, I gravitate towards spending time with a select few close friends. I cherish the depth and intimacy that come from a tight-knit circle. In such an environment, I can partake in more meaningful discussions, express personal thoughts and feelings, and cultivate stronger relationships. While I recognize the advantages of a vast social network, I firmly believe that the rewards of close, enduring friendships surpass the benefits of a larger acquaintance circle. Ultimately, whether one prefers a few close friends or a wider array of acquaintances is a matter of personal choice and priorities.
192;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways or should government spend more money on improving public transportation (Buses, trains,subways)?;The development of public transportation is the most essential thing for a developed society. Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources, the air pollution, the loss of a sense of community. So, I think the government have to spend more money on improving it.The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out. Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move. If people use too many private cars, the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly. Instead of using many private cars, people can use public transportation, such as bus, train, subway, each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person.The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution. Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide, heat and so on. They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer. The more cars are driven, the more pollution will be put into air. If we use the public transportation, less cars will be used and less pollution will be emitted. The atmosphere, surrounding us, will be protected and help us more healthy.The use of public transportation make us live more sociable. When we drive a private car, we are alone or only our family members that we already know and lost the opportunity to make friends with others or to see that we are a part of this society. When using public transportation, we have a chance to meet more people and more chances to discovery new aspects of life.Using public transportation has a lot of advantages for the modern society facing a lot of problems: the environmental population, the isolation in life, the depletion of natural resources. So, the government have to invest more for it and encourage people to use.;The ongoing discussion regarding whether to allocate more funds for road and highway improvements or to enhance public transportation continues to spark debate. In my view, the government should focus on increasing investments in public transportation.Enhancing public transportation systems, such as buses, trains, and subways, brings a wealth of advantages for the environment, economy, and society at large. For example, a robust public transportation network alleviates traffic congestion, which subsequently lowers air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in a cleaner and healthier environment for residents. Moreover, effective public transportation facilitates economic growth by providing individuals with better access to jobs, education, and vital services.Conversely, while investing in roads and highways might appear to be advantageous in the short term, it can lead to a heightened reliance on personal vehicles, exacerbating traffic issues and contributing to environmental harm. Additionally, the costs associated with building and maintaining roads can be substantial and may draw resources away from other critical public services.In summary, although both funding options have advantages, I strongly advocate for prioritizing public transportation investments. Doing so will foster a more sustainable, efficient, and equitable transportation framework that benefits our environment, economy, and society. It is crucial for the government to emphasize the development of public transportation, paving the way for a brighter future for its citizens. By investing in buses, trains, and subways, the government can reduce its carbon footprint, stimulate economic growth, and enhance the overall quality of life for its population.
193;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals. Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention. In my opinion, we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment.Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals. Firstly, like we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts. Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas. When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts. Hence, when they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate. In addition to the previous point, various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care. For instance, I recall my first trip to a zoo, at age eight. I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated. I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo. They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals.In conclusion, I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible. Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals. Moreover, many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them.;I concur with the viewpoint that animals should be free and that humans should refrain from confining them in zoos. Keeping animals in these facilities represents a form of captivity that robs them of their natural habitats and the freedom they deserve. A key issue is that zoos cannot replicate the vast space and environment that animals enjoy in the wild. For instance, elephants in captivity often display abnormal behaviors like pacing and swaying, which result from inadequate space and stimulation.Moreover, confining animals in zoos can negatively impact their physical and mental well-being. Many zoo inhabitants endure stress, anxiety, and depression due to their confinement and the absence of natural social interactions. Furthermore, zoos often resort to breeding programs that can lead to inbreeding and associated genetic issues. Many big cat species, for example, have been found to suffer from genetic disorders as a result of inbreeding practices.Additionally, with the progress made in technology and conservation efforts, there are alternative methods for learning about and appreciating animals without keeping them in zoos. Documentaries, wildlife reserves, and sanctuaries offer opportunities for animals to thrive in their natural habitats while allowing people to observe and learn from them. In summary, confining animals in zoos is not only inhumane but also unnecessary. Animals should be allowed to roam freely in their natural environments, and humans should seek out alternative ways to appreciate these remarkable beings. By doing so, we can prioritize the well-being and conservation of animals instead of exploiting them for entertainment purposes.
194;A university plans to develop a new research center in your country. Some people want a center for business research. Other people want a center for research in agriculture (farming). Which of these two kinds of research centers do you recommend for your country? Use specific reasons in your recommendation.;Most of the universities in the world seek to develop some research in some countries. These researches can be aimed for several fields such as business or agriculture. If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research, I would opt for the second one.First of all, my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture. Most of these lands are left without any treatment. The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land. This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land. Especially, if they have no knowledge or education in this field.Secondly, the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve. The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part. The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products. For example, the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country. The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product, how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms.Another reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs. Obviously, showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money. Some people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field. For me being a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business, but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction, and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that.My country need to focus more on the agriculture by establishing centers for research in this field, which will have some very positive consequences on agriculture people work, on the economy and on the employment.;As a nation, it is crucial that we prioritize research centers that address our country's immediate needs and harness its potential. If faced with the option of funding a business research center or one focused on agriculture, I strongly advocate for the latter. This recommendation stems from the fact that agriculture is an essential sector, employing a substantial portion of our workforce and significantly contributing to our national economy.An agricultural research center would empower our nation to enhance farming practices, boost crop yields, and develop resistance to pests and diseases. The benefits of such advancements would extend to improved food security, which is vital for national stability and progress. Additionally, the center could emphasize sustainable farming methods, crucial for environmental protection and combating climate change.While a business research center could certainly yield advantages, including fostering entrepreneurship and economic growth, it might not meet our country's core needs as effectively as an agricultural research center. Our economic development is intricately linked to our capacity to nourish our population and manage natural resources sustainably. By focusing on agricultural research, we can pave the way for a more secure and promising future for our citizens.Moreover, the results of agricultural research can significantly enhance the lives of rural communities, which are often the most vulnerable to poverty and food scarcity. By increasing agricultural productivity, we can empower these communities both economically and socially, fostering a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities throughout our nation. Therefore, establishing a research center dedicated to agriculture is not only a pragmatic decision but also a socially responsible one, aligning with the overarching goals of sustainable development and the well-being of all citizens.
195;People learn in different ways. Some people learn by doing things, other people learn by reading about things, others learn by listening to people talk about things. Which of these methods of learning is best for you? Use specific examples to support your choice.;People have a lot of things to learn in their lives. They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills. One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about. There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives.First of all, learning by doing things develops our maturity. When you do things by your self, you learn to depend on yourself. You will not be in need to refer to books or persons. The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity. For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader, they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group, or even a situation. We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading. Secondly, learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about. There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them. Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing. People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming. Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming.Another reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things. With the time, Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring. Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things. So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them.The history shows that learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things. People should not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn. They should try and keep trying until they learn what they want to learn.;"The timeless saying ""everyone learns differently"" has been repeatedly validated as absolutely true. Each of us has unique learning styles that align with our individual needs and preferences. Personally, I find that the most effective way for me to learn is through hands-on experience. This active approach consistently produces the best outcomes, allowing me to understand and remember information more easily.A prime example of this is my experience in a cooking class. Instead of just reading a recipe or passively listening to the instructor, I learned the complexities of making a complicated dish by directly engaging in the cooking process. This practical involvement helped me gain a deeper insight into the various techniques and ingredients, enabling me to confidently recreate the dish later.In contrast, while reading and listening provide a basic understanding, they often lack the interactive and immersive elements that hands-on learning offers. For instance, when preparing for a science exam, simply reading about a topic or attending a lecture can result in only a surface-level grasp, whereas conducting experiments or participating in lab work fosters a much richer comprehension of the material.In summary, hands-on learning has proven to be the most effective method for me. By engaging in practical activities, I can absorb and retain information more effectively, while also developing important skills and confidence. Therefore, I firmly believe that this learning approach is not only beneficial but essential for individuals like myself who thrive in engaging and immersive environments."
196;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;The rise of affordable air travel has transformed how people journey around the world, granting them unprecedented opportunities to discover far-flung destinations. This accessibility has enabled many to immerse themselves in diverse cultures, enjoy unique vacations, and maintain connections with family and friends living overseas. The resulting increase in mobility has not only enhanced individual experiences but has also spurred tourism growth, invigorating local economies and generating employment.However, some critics assert that the surge in inexpensive air travel poses significant environmental challenges. The aviation sector is a notable contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, with the heightened demand for air connectivity leading to a marked increase in carbon footprints. Furthermore, advocates of pricier air travel suggest that raising costs would likely lower demand, thereby reducing emissions and alleviating environmental issues tied to air travel.In my view, while the environmental concerns are legitimate and warrant attention, completely deterring air travel through higher prices might not be the fairest approach. Instead, airlines and governments should investigate more sustainable practices, such as investing in cleaner energy sources and implementing carbon offset programs that enable travelers to mitigate their emissions. Enhancing fuel efficiency and minimizing waste within the aviation sector can also play a crucial role in lessening its environmental footprint. Thus, a balanced strategy that acknowledges the societal advantages of affordable air travel while prioritizing environmental protection is essential. By embracing sustainable practices and innovations, we can uphold our freedom to travel for future generations while reducing its adverse effects on the planet.
197;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation(buses, trains, subways)? Why?Ê;Many people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation. In my opinion, governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating.First, the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation. Cars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up. In the contrary, if the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower. And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline.Second, public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems. Averagely, public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars. It means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes.Last but not least, using public transportation is much safer than private transportation. According to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care. Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting.In short, I can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in.;The discussion about whether governments should focus on enhancing roads and highways or public transportation has persisted for years. In my view, increased funding for public transportation is essential. This is due to the multitude of advantages it offers for the environment, economy, and society at large.To begin with, investing in public transit can significantly alleviate traffic congestion and cut down on air pollution. By creating efficient and reliable bus, train, and subway systems, individuals are more likely to forgo their cars, leading to lower greenhouse gas emissions and fewer traffic jams. The result is improved air quality, reduced noise pollution, and enhanced livability in urban areas.Moreover, a robust public transportation network can drive economic growth by linking people to job opportunities, educational facilities, and vital services. It can make cities more appealing to businesses, tourists, and residents, thereby invigorating local economies. Additionally, public transit can help bridge social inequalities by offering affordable and accessible transportation options to low-income populations.On the other hand, while additional funding for roads and highways may yield immediate benefits like decreased congestion, it often contributes to urban sprawl, greater reliance on fossil fuels, and various environmental challenges. The construction and upkeep of roads and highways are also extremely expensive, and the financial resources allocated to these projects would be better invested in building sustainable and efficient public transportation systems.In summary, governments should prioritize funding for public transportation instead of roads and highways. By doing so, they can foster more sustainable, equitable, and economically thriving cities, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for all citizens.
198;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer?;Everyone has their method to success in life. At school or university, success depends on how we study. Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups. Yet, I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more, and it helps me to build my personality.Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons. For instance, I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone. I can prepare my schedules, guidelines, exercises and go over them all. Moreover, we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math, reading, and drawing. In my opinion, I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone.Additionally, we are building our personalities when we study alone. For example, answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent. Also, it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future. Personally, when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time, it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful. To conclude, there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group. In fact, I agree with the idea of studying a lone since it helps me to focus more and establish my personality. Success needs us to work hard and sacrifice more whether we choose to study alone or with group.;Students have varied preferences when it comes to studying. Some choose to study independently, while others thrive in group settings. Personally, I find studying in a group to be more effective, and I have several reasons for this preference.To begin with, studying in a group fosters the exchange of knowledge and ideas. Collaborating with peers allows us to engage in discussions and clarify any confusing concepts. For example, if I encounter difficulties with a specific math problem, my friends can assist me in working through it and offering explanations that resonate with me. This cooperative learning style enhances my comprehension and improves my ability to retain the information.Additionally, I appreciate group study because it encourages peer teaching. During our study sessions, we can each take a turn educating one another on various topics. This approach not only strengthens our own grasp of the material but also allows us to learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses. For instance, if one of my friends excels in a particular area, their insights and tips can significantly enhance my understanding and performance.Finally, studying in a group enhances accountability and motivation. When I study alone, I often find it easy to get sidetracked or procrastinate. However, working alongside others keeps us motivated and focused. We can set collective goals and challenges, supporting one another in reaching them. In summary, I believe that group study is far more advantageous than studying alone, as it promotes knowledge sharing, peer education, and motivation.
199;Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed (damaged) by human activity. Others feel that human activity makes the Earth a better place to live. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Whether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue. Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth. However, I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet, for human are polluting the Earth's environment, exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species.People are corrupting their ecosphere. In recent decades, concurrently with the increase of human consume, the waste discarded by human also multiplies. These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a ""new"" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage. Furthermore, the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air, causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain, global warming or climate change.Besides, people are draining the Earth's natural resources. These resources such as oil, coal are vital for human activity, therefore nowadays, the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people. Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after, the Earth's natural resources are totally exhausted. At that time, human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources.Also, people are endangering other species' live. Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food. Through million years of hunting, especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite, people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct. Moreover, people, suffering from the population pressure, are expanding their living area; consequently, the living area of other species narrowed. This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction.All in all, from discussed reasons, we can conclude that human activity are gradually destroy the Earth since it is polluting the Earth environment, depleting the resource and imperiling other species' lives.";"The ongoing debate regarding the impact of human activity on the planet has ignited passionate discussions in recent years. I am convinced that human actions are inflicting more damage than benefits on the Earth. A key reason for this belief is the alarming surge in pollution. The rampant burning of fossil fuels and the by-products of industrial processes have significantly raised greenhouse gas emissions, leading to climate change and global warming. The devastating wildfires in Australia and the rapid melting of polar ice caps serve as stark reminders of the catastrophic outcomes of our behaviors.Another major issue is deforestation and habitat destruction. Activities such as logging, mining, and urban expansion have resulted in the clearance of extensive forest areas, leading to a decline in biodiversity and the extinction of countless species. The Amazon rainforest, often called the ""lungs of the Earth"" for its vital role in oxygen production, is being decimated at an alarming pace. Additionally, practices like overfishing and plastic pollution are harming our oceans, putting marine ecosystems at risk.While some might argue that human activity has led to improvements through technological advancements and innovative solutions, I contend that these benefits are far overshadowed by the detrimental effects of our actions. It is crucial that we act swiftly to lessen the damage caused by human activities by reducing our carbon footprint, conserving natural resources, and adopting sustainable practices. Ultimately, we bear the responsibility to safeguard our planet and ensure a viable future for the generations that follow."
200;A company is going to give some money either to support the arts or protect the environment. Which do you think the company chooses? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"If I had the opportunity to help a company make a decision on spending money either on supporting the arts or helping the environment, I would choose the latter without hesitation for the reasons below. First, conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history. According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association, we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed, which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered. What's more, rising sea levels, caused by global warming, have reached a level that is threatening human's life in many countries. If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars, nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change, causing flooding, drought, and an increasing amount of damaging storms. In short, the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn't take harsh measures now, we never will.Furthermore, supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually. Nowadays, an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation; therefore, sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising. Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment, then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society.Finally, conservation leads us to a higher standard of living. I confess that art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings, but, with exhaust fumes and acid rain, we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs. Biodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art.To sum up, although supporting art will benefit the human beings and the company in short-term interest, I still hold the environment protection for long-term interest.";When faced with the choice between supporting the arts and prioritizing environmental protection, I believe the company would opt to prioritize the environment. This choice reflects the increasing awareness of environmental issues and the potential long-term advantages for both the company’s reputation and financial performance.Firstly, environmental protection is crucial not only for the present but also for the future viability of our planet. Companies are becoming more aware of the significance of sustainability in addressing climate change, pollution, and conservation efforts. By championing environmental initiatives, the company can showcase its commitment to corporate social responsibility, enhancing its public image. For example, Patagonia has gained substantial customer loyalty and appreciation through its vigorous environmental activism.Secondly, investing in environmental protection offers tangible benefits for the company. Implementing sustainable practices and reducing carbon emissions can create cost savings over time. Additionally, both governments and consumers are increasingly supportive of companies that meet rigorous environmental standards, which can generate new business opportunities and expand market share. A prime example is Tesla, which not only contributes to lowering carbon emissions but also transformed the automotive industry with its innovative electric vehicles.In contrast, while support for the arts brings significant community engagement and cultural enrichment, it may not provide the same direct business advantages as environmental protection. That said, some companies might still choose to support the arts as a means to foster creativity, enhance employee morale, and promote community development, which can yield indirect benefits.To sum up, given the current global emphasis on sustainability and the direct business advantages associated with environmental stewardship, I believe the company is more inclined to prioritize environmental protection. This decision aligns with shifting societal expectations and positions the company for enduring success and sustainability.
201;We all work or will work in our jobs with many different kinds of people. In your opinion, what are some important characteristics of a co-worker (Someone you work closely with) ? Use reasons and specific examples to explain why these characteristics are important.Ê;At work, you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment. However, the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you, and in most instances you have to rely on him or her. Therefore in my view, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.The co-workers should be cooperative with one another. If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes. I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious. Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not. Most of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person. However, one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor. When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse. From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility. Therefore, I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment.The co-workers need to trust each other. They should not act on suspicion. This is a very important aspect in the work environment. I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me. To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him. However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me. But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department. Finally, the co-workers should believe in fellowship. This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships. After all, you spend most of your day at office. If you have a good company in office, it is certainly a blessing.;When collaborating closely with colleagues, several key traits can significantly influence the effectiveness of teamwork and overall job satisfaction. I believe that two of the most crucial characteristics of a co-worker are reliability and strong communication skills.To begin with, reliability is essential as it guarantees that tasks are completed on schedule and to a high standard. A dependable co-worker is someone who honors their commitments, takes accountability for their responsibilities, and is consistently punctual. For example, if I am involved in a project with a colleague who frequently misses deadlines, it can lead to delays and additional workload for the rest of the team, negatively impacting the final results. Conversely, a reliable co-worker facilitates smooth collaboration, fosters trust, and helps the team meet its objectives effectively.Moreover, strong communication skills are imperative in a co-worker, as they promote clarity, reduce misunderstandings, and contribute to a positive workplace atmosphere. A colleague with good communication abilities can express their ideas clearly, listen attentively, and offer constructive feedback. For instance, during a team meeting, a co-worker who can articulate their thoughts and perspectives clearly assists the team in making informed decisions and avoiding confusion. Additionally, effective communication encompasses being approachable, empathetic, and respectful, all of which help to nurture strong professional relationships and resolve conflicts constructively.In summary, reliability and strong communication skills are vital traits for a co-worker. These qualities enable teams to operate efficiently, establish trust, and reach their goals. Collaborating with individuals who embody these characteristics ensures a productive and positive work environment, ultimately leading to increased job satisfaction and success.
202;When people succeed it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success. Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;There are many instances that luck has brought people things that they never could even imagine. However, I do not see any rational in believing in luck to reach one's goals. Therefore I strongly agree with the argument that it is one's hard work that helps him reach his target.First, if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments, you are taking a great risk. Luck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way. If it doesn't work, it would be a great disappointment. Instead if you strive hard to achieve what you want, then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal. In my personal experience, all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work, not my luck. And I never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals.Secondly, if you believe that hard work is the key to success, it would make you a visionary person. In other words, those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination. They carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal. If you believe in luck, you would be clueless about where you are heading. For example, a friend of mine, who had severe financial constraints, had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery. He was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery. However, up to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened. Thirdly, if you work hard, luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target. For example, my boss worked tirelessly for his promotion. He looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion. He realized that having a master's degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors. Although he had many commitments at home and work, he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply. At the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship since he had more credentials than other officers in his capacity. Although it is good to be lucky, depending on luck for everything is not good. Hence I strongly believe in hard working that would not easily disappoint you as luck sometimes does.;"I take issue with the assertion that success is solely the result of hard work, with luck playing no part. While hard work is undoubtedly vital for achieving success, luck also has a considerable influence. Numerous successful individuals have credited their achievements to a blend of effort and fortuitous events.Take J.K. Rowling, for example. She began writing the first Harry Potter book while living on welfare as a single mother. Her dedication and persistence are clear, yet she has also acknowledged the role of luck in encountering the right publisher at the right moment. Had her manuscript not been accepted by Bloomsbury, the iconic series might never have reached its current global status.Moreover, many entrepreneurs and business leaders recognize luck's contribution to their success. Both Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, and Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft, have noted that being in the right place at the right time with the right idea was crucial to their ventures' achievements. This doesn’t diminish the importance of hard work; rather, it illustrates that luck also played a vital role in their journeys.In summary, while hard work is fundamental to success, it is unrealistic to completely discount the influence of luck. Many successful people have thrived due to a combination of hard work and fortunate circumstances. Consequently, I strongly assert that luck significantly impacts success, making it clear that accomplishments are not solely derived from effort. Recognizing the interplay between hard work and luck provides a richer understanding of what it takes to succeed."
203;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;During these digital age, the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society. Almost every school develops their online class systems. One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning. Although, online classes have many advantages, for me, I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons.First, the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying. Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class. Consequently, the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate's ideas. Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends.Second, classroom learning provides other activities than studying. During student's free time, they have a number of activities that they can join, such as playing sports, going to lab, or going to library. These activities lead to more interact with their friends. Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities, furthermore, they have a chance to learn about their societies. While the online course keeps the children at their home only.Lastly, in school, there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice. The professor provides good answers to you. They do not mind helping you, and they never leave you alone when you got a problem. In contrast, in distance learning, these aspects of the professor had reduced their important. The professor has been assigned to teach only. Moreover, there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question.In conclusion, traditional learning still has many benefits to the students. But in the future, it seems that the distance learning become more popular and ordinary in schools.;The rise of technology has transformed education, making distance learning and online computer classes a viable substitute for traditional classroom instruction. In recent years, there has been a notable trend towards online learning, leading to the argument that it could replace conventional classroom education. This essay will explore the advantages of online learning and contend that it is a more effective and efficient method of education.A key advantage of online learning is its flexibility. Students have the freedom to learn at their own pace and can access course materials anytime and from anywhere. This flexibility is especially beneficial for those juggling work or family responsibilities, or for individuals in remote areas with limited access to educational facilities. Furthermore, online learning platforms offer a diverse array of resources, including video lectures, interactive simulations, and online discussions, all of which can enrich the educational experience.Another major benefit of online learning is its cost-effectiveness. Online courses often feature lower tuition fees compared to traditional courses, and students can save on expenses related to travel and accommodation. Additionally, online learning lessens the need for physical infrastructure, such as classrooms and libraries, resulting in substantial financial savings for educational institutions.Moreover, online learning allows students to connect with a global community of learners, which can expand their perspectives and enhance cultural awareness. Online forums and discussions enable students to engage with instructors and peers, fostering collaborative learning and problem-solving skills.In conclusion, distance learning and online computer classes present a flexible, cost-effective, and interactive approach to education that can significantly improve the learning experience. While traditional classroom learning has its merits, online learning empowers students to learn at their own pace, access a wealth of resources, and engage with a worldwide network of learners. As technology advances, it is probable that online education will continue to gain popularity and effectiveness.
204;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;The issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes. This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide. Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic. An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students. However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.Firstly, a liberal policy is very feasible. Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy. Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend. So an optional attendance saves time and money.Secondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook. This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic. By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching. Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.In addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life. Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning. With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency. Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.Finally, psychology knows two types of motivation. There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset. And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people. Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being. However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims. By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves. These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.To conclude, it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students. I hold this belief due to the improvement of students' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards.;The discussion about whether university students should be required to attend classes has gained considerable attention in recent years. Some argue that compulsory attendance is crucial for academic success, while others advocate for the option of attendance, allowing students to better manage their own time. I strongly believe that attendance should be optional for university students.One of the main arguments for optional attendance is that it encourages independence and self-motivation among students. As adults, university students should take responsibility for their own education and time management. When attendance is not mandatory, students learn to prioritize tasks, establish goals, and cultivate a sense of accountability. This ultimately helps them become more self-directed learners.Additionally, optional attendance accommodates varying learning styles and individual needs. Some students may excel through online resources, self-study, or practical experiences instead of traditional classroom instruction. Moreover, students with disabilities, jobs, or family responsibilities might struggle to attend classes regularly. By offering the choice to attend or not, universities can address diverse student needs and promote inclusivity.In summary, although mandatory attendance has its advantages, I believe that optional attendance is more beneficial for university students. It fosters independence, supports different learning methods, and encourages a sense of responsibility. Allowing students the freedom to choose when and how they learn empowers them to take control of their academic experience, ultimately leading to improved outcomes, greater student satisfaction, and a more inclusive educational environment.
205;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Place of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors. Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas, whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town. I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages, such as good weather, a healthy life and better facilities.Firstly, the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items. One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town. Also, in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic. Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness. Moreover, in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits. Regardless of some exceptions, it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities.Secondly, another advantage of small towns is living costs. Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then, in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities. Therefore, in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes, also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services. Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money.In conclusion, I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress, because of better weather conditions and also, better relationship within a town. In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities therefore on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities. However it is an obvious fact that people in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress.;When selecting a place to live, many people grapple with the allure of small towns versus the energetic atmosphere of larger cities. While some may appreciate the tranquility and close-knit feel of rural areas, I firmly maintain that urban living is the more appealing choice.One of the primary advantages of big cities is the wide array of job opportunities they provide, a crucial consideration for those focused on their careers. The presence of numerous industries and enterprises in metropolitan areas facilitates professional advancement and networking with others in the field. Conversely, small towns frequently offer limited employment options, which can result in stagnation and a lack of excitement.Additionally, big cities boast access to superior amenities and services. Urban areas typically feature cutting-edge infrastructure, including top-tier hospitals, educational institutions, and efficient transportation networks. Moreover, they serve as cultural and entertainment epicenters, with a diverse range of recreational activities, such as museums, theaters, and live music venues. The breadth of experiences and exposure to varied cultures found in cities is unmatched by small towns.Finally, living in a big city encourages independence and self-sufficiency. The fast-paced and sometimes impersonal nature of urban life compels individuals to be adaptable and resourceful, skills that are essential in today’s rapidly evolving world. While small towns may cultivate a sense of community, this often comes at the cost of personal freedom and autonomy.In summary, although small towns possess their unique appeal, I contend that the advantages of urban living far surpass those of rural life. With their abundant job prospects, superior amenities, and environment that nurtures independence, big cities are ideally suited for those seeking both personal and professional development.
206;In many countries, young people leave rural areas to study or work in cities. What do you think are reason of this? Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;These days, there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities. Personally, I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this.To begin with, the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas. Obviously, many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career. Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living. For example, if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time. However, this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences. There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities. As a result, cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation. Additionally, it might put strain on the environment. If there are more people in the cities, there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road, which causes air pollution.In conclusion, young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials. In my opinion, however, I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment.;The movement of young people from rural regions to urban centers is a common occurrence across many countries. I believe that one of the main factors behind this trend is the limited educational and employment opportunities available in rural areas. In contrast, cities provide a broader selection of universities, colleges, and job markets, drawing young individuals in search of better prospects. Additionally, urban environments expose them to a variety of cultures, lifestyles, and experiences that can foster personal growth.Another contributing factor to this migration is the perception of a higher quality of life in urban areas. Cities typically boast superior infrastructure, amenities, and services, which can be more appealing to the youth. Moreover, the allure of independence and the freedom associated with city living can be a strong motivator for young people eager to leave their parental homes and embark on their own journeys.While this migration does present challenges—such as the strain on urban resources and the risk of rural depopulation—I believe the benefits surpass the drawbacks. The arrival of young, educated, and skilled individuals can stimulate economic growth and advancement in cities. Furthermore, the experiences and knowledge acquired in urban settings can eventually be brought back to rural communities, aiding in their development.In summary, the migration of youth from rural areas to cities is primarily fueled by the pursuit of improved educational and job opportunities, as well as the desire for a better standard of living. Although there are potential disadvantages, I maintain that the advantages, including economic advancement and personal growth, are more significant. Ultimately, this trend can result in a more skilled, educated, and diverse population that benefits both urban and rural communities.
207;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement. High school students should take a course on basic economics;In today's community, economy becomes the order of the day. Getting to know the theory in this area seems really important for our students. Then, the earlier we jump into this area, the more skillful we will be. Thus, in my point of view, although it will take some time on it, high school students should take a course on basic economics. Let me explain it in detail.For the primary concern, it can provide students a sense of direction in academy. Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field, let them to know what this subject mainly discuss. That will help the students cultivate their own interest and a sense of career orientation. Finally, students may study harder for their economic dreams. On the other hand, economy is always correlate with politics, students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status, which may open their vision toward the nation and don't get limited in the textbooks. Besides, there is also an intimate connection between economy and enterprises, students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid.In addition, the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college. They may feel more readily to learn the knowledge in this field and save much time, with that they are able to study more efficiently and more deeply than other students. That as well would provide the students with more confidence and let them become more compatible.Considering all those factors above, I suggest the basic course of economic is necessary.;I wholeheartedly believe that high school students should have the opportunity to take a course in basic economics. In our complicated and increasingly interconnected world, having a grasp of economic principles is vital for making informed choices about personal finances and understanding the wider societal impacts of economic trends and policies.A basic economics course would equip high school students with essential knowledge of fundamental concepts such as supply and demand, various market structures, the government’s role in the economy, and key personal finance skills like budgeting and saving. This understanding would enable students to approach the financial world with assurance, allowing them to make sound decisions regarding spending, saving, and investing their money. Additionally, it would nurture a stronger comprehension of current events and policy discussions, preparing them to be engaged and informed citizens.Moreover, introducing economics at the high school level could motivate students to explore careers in areas such as business, finance, or public policy. Early introduction to economic concepts could lead to a more financially literate populace, capable of contributing positively to the economy and avoiding common issues like debt and financial instability.Integrating basic economics into high school curricula could also yield favorable outcomes for the economy as a whole. By educating the next generation about the value of money, the significance of saving, and the ramifications of debt, we can strive towards a future where individuals are better prepared to manage their finances and enhance the economic well-being of their communities.In summary, implementing a basic economics course in high schools not only enhances students' financial literacy but also cultivates a more economically aware and responsible society. It furnishes future generations with crucial knowledge and skills, promoting their independence and active engagement in the economy. Therefore, I strongly advocate for making basic economics a required subject for high school students.
208;University education should be restricted to the very best academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;The idea that university education should be confined to a select group of exceptionally gifted students has ignited significant debate. While some contend that this method maintains the quality of higher education, I strongly oppose this view.Limiting university access to a privileged few would have profound implications, including stifling social mobility and deepening inequality. Restricting higher education to only the top-performing students would deny opportunities to individuals from underprivileged backgrounds who may lack access to quality education and resources. This would create a cycle of disadvantage, further marginalizing those already facing socio-economic challenges.Moreover, the value of university education extends beyond mere academic performance. It serves as a crucial avenue for personal development, skill acquisition, and networking—all of which are vital in today’s workforce. By narrowing access to higher education, we deprive a significant number of young people of the opportunity to cultivate these essential skills and attributes.Additionally, the richness of university life is heavily influenced by a diverse student population, fostering engagement among individuals from various backgrounds, cultures, and viewpoints. Admitting only the most academically gifted would result in a homogeneous environment, lacking the diversity necessary for a truly enriching educational experience.In summary, although concerns regarding the quality of higher education are valid, I firmly maintain that university access should be broadened to include a wide array of young individuals, rather than being restricted to the academically elite. Such an approach would foster social mobility, enhance diversity, and offer invaluable opportunities for personal growth and skill development, ultimately benefiting both individuals and society at large.
209;Prevention is better than cure. Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;The idea that prevention is more effective than treatment has gained substantial momentum in recent years, with many advocating for a redirection of healthcare funds towards health education and preventive strategies. I largely concur with the view that a considerable share of a nation's health budget should be reallocated from treatment to initiatives focused on health education and prevention.On one hand, investing in health education and preventive measures can yield long-term benefits, such as lowering the rates of chronic diseases and fostering a healthier populace. For example, awareness campaigns that emphasize the importance of regular physical activity, nutritious diets, and effective stress management can empower individuals to take charge of their health. Additionally, preventive strategies like vaccinations, screenings, and routine check-ups can help identify health concerns at an early stage, thus minimizing the need for expensive treatments.However, reallocating funds from treatment to prevention could lead to unintended consequences, including the neglect of individuals already grappling with health issues. It's crucial to maintain a balance between prevention and treatment to ensure that those in urgent medical need receive appropriate care. Nonetheless, I maintain that the advantages of preventive measures outweigh any potential drawbacks, and that a substantial portion of the health budget should be dedicated to health education and prevention.In conclusion, while there are compelling arguments on both sides of the debate, I firmly believe that prevention is indeed preferable to cure. By channeling a significant part of the health budget towards health education and preventive measures, governments can foster a healthier society, reduce overall healthcare expenditures, and ultimately enhance the well-being of their citizens.
210;With the pressures on todayÕs young people to succeed academically, some people believe that non-academic subjects at school (eg: physical education and cookery should be removed from the syllabus so that children can concentrate wholly on academic subjects. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Students have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success. While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that.To begin with, from the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects. If physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students’ health. For instance, after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes. Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people’s health, it will also decrease their learning capability.In addition, schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people. It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically. Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit. Thus, school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life.Some people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents. However, I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents. Moreover, parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills.In conclusion, I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student’s development. Therefore, schools should not remove these subjects.;The idea of eliminating non-academic subjects like physical education and cookery from school curricula to allow students to concentrate exclusively on academics has gained considerable traction in recent years. Although the intent behind this suggestion may be to boost academic performance, I am fundamentally opposed to it.To begin with, non-academic subjects are crucial for the comprehensive development of students. For example, physical education encourages children to maintain their physical health, build teamwork abilities, and foster self-discipline. Similarly, subjects like cookery promote creativity, independence, and essential life skills. Removing these areas of study would deprive students of opportunities to explore their interests and talents outside of traditional academics.Furthermore, placing excessive emphasis on academic subjects can lead to student burnout and diminished motivation. Non-academic classes offer necessary breaks from the demands of academic learning, enabling students to recharge and refocus. This, in turn, can positively influence their academic outcomes. Additionally, many non-academic activities, particularly physical education, have been shown to enhance cognitive function and concentration, which can further support academic success.Lastly, it is crucial to acknowledge that success in life is not solely determined by academic results. The skills and knowledge gained through non-academic subjects are invaluable in real-world scenarios, where competencies such as teamwork, time management, and problem-solving are highly regarded. By discarding these subjects, we risk graduating students who excel academically but lack the practical skills and emotional intelligence necessary to thrive in their future professional and personal lives.In conclusion, while the pressure to achieve academically is undeniable, I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are integral to a well-rounded education. Instead of eliminating these programs, schools should aim to achieve a balance between academic and non-academic activities, allowing students to grow into capable, confident, and well-adjusted individuals.
211;When people move to another country, some of them decide to follow the customs of the new country. Others prefer to keep their own customs. Compare these two choices. Which one do you prefer? Support your answer with specific details.;When people move to another country, most likely, they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one. Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture, while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted. As for me, I would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country.On one hand, it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs. When people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures. The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture. For example, if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture. As a result, people understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country.On the other hand, keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination. When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country. The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society. One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969. They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it. While the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working. Although being much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination. Their houses and private cars were buried by local people, because the locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs. If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated.All in all, the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country, which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner, and assimilate to a new culture.;When people move to another country, they often grapple with the choice between embracing the local customs or holding onto their own cultural traditions. This situation raises a discussion about the significance of cultural assimilation versus the preservation of heritage. In this essay, I will explore both options and argue that maintaining one's own customs is the superior choice.On one hand, adopting the customs of the new country can aid in integration and foster social acceptance. By engaging with local traditions, immigrants show their dedication to their new community and can minimize cultural conflicts. However, this path might result in a loss of one's cultural identity and heritage. For instance, an individual who fully assimilates into the new culture may find it challenging to pass down their native traditions to future generations, leading to a disconnection from their origins.Conversely, preserving one’s own customs enables individuals to retain a robust sense of cultural identity and maintain ties to their homeland. This approach allows them to share their distinct perspectives and traditions with their new community, enhancing the cultural richness of their adopted country. For example, celebrating traditional holidays and festivals can provide comfort and familiarity in an unfamiliar setting. Additionally, maintaining one's customs can also foster a sense of community and belonging among fellow immigrants with similar cultural backgrounds.In summary, while there are benefits to adopting the customs of a new country, I advocate for retaining one’s own traditions. This choice permits individuals to safeguard their cultural heritage, uphold a strong sense of identity, and enrich the diverse cultural landscape of their new home. Ultimately, this approach empowers immigrants to cultivate a sense of belonging while staying true to their roots.
212;Is it more important to be able to ework with a group of people on ta tem or to work independently? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, as the world is getting smaller, we need to be able to cooperate. Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success. Despite the importance of working in team, I still believe that the capability of working independly is more significant.Of course, effective cooperation can make things easier and faster, but in many important cases when team-working is not possible, the ability to work alone will help. The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working. Let's imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people, but you have no experience of working alone, standardized tests such as SAT, TOEFL may be your nightmares. Testing is a very important aspect of life, and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team. Therefore, if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college, acing your school's final tests, you should consider learning to work on your own.Moreover, the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people. Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas. Everybody in a team must have his/her own opinion first, then discuss them with other members. When we work in team, we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate. When everyone in a team can come up with his/her own ideas, working in team will definitely more effective.In conclusion, working with a group a people and working individually are all important. Both skills are necessary for a successful life. Nevertheless, the capablity of working alone is the foundation for the skill to work in team and plays a significant role in a lot of situations.;In today's fast-moving and interconnected environment, the capacity to collaborate effectively within a team has become increasingly important compared to working independently. While there are benefits to being independent, teamwork plays a vital role in reaching complex objectives and addressing challenges that necessitate a range of skills and viewpoints.Collaborating in a team enables individuals to combine their strengths, exchange ideas, and benefit from each other’s experiences. For example, in a marketing campaign, a team made up of members skilled in graphic design, writing, and social media can work together to produce a thorough and engaging strategy. Each individual contributes their unique abilities, resulting in more innovative and effective solutions than if they were operating solo.Additionally, teamwork enhances creativity, problem-solving, and flexibility. When individuals collaborate, they can generate solutions to challenges, as demonstrated in Silicon Valley's tech firms, where cross-functional teams innovate cutting-edge technologies together. Teamwork also encourages accountability, motivation, and effective time management, as members depend on each other to meet deadlines and accomplish goals.On the other hand, working alone can lead to restricted perspectives, skills, and resources. Although some might prefer solitary work, they may overlook opportunities for growth, learning, and networking that collaboration can offer. Moreover, many real-world issues, including climate change, poverty, and healthcare, necessitate collective efforts from specialists across various fields to formulate effective solutions.In summary, the ability to work well in a team is more crucial than functioning independently. By capitalizing on the strengths and expertise of their team members, individuals can achieve more impactful and sustainable results, foster innovation, and tackle complex challenges that demand collaboration and diverse insights.
213;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be promitted in restaurants and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld. Use examples and specific reasons to support your position.;Smoking brings a person great enjoyment and relief. However, one should not be encouraged to smoke as the cost of other people's health. In this case, I advocate the idea that smoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places, and that we should support states laws to ban it because smoking not only damages the restaurant's environment, but also imposes a potential threat on others' health.First of all, although it is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society, one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others' health. It is generally believed that, the second-hand smoke, which comes from the smoker's mouth, puts an even greater threat on surrounding people's health than the smoker himself. For example, if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant, all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked. This is because some burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person's respiratory system after he/she inhales it. Therefore, smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned because it makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer's health.Furthermore, even though some customers do not worry about the threat that second-hand smoke imposes on them, the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite, or, in other words, spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience. The smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted, thus affecting their mood in having their meals. This, on the other hand, can indirectly decrease the restaurants' popularity because fewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences. Lastly, smoking does no good to the smoker himself. Not only does it aggravate his health, making him more subject to respiratory diseases, but also it damages his public image and reputation. This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity, because most people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior. At this point, the public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader. To conclude, smoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior. It spoils the smoker's reputation and threats other people's health. Therefore, it is unwise to smoke in a restaurant as well as other public places, and relevant state laws should be codified to strictly prohibit it.;I wholeheartedly support the notion that smoking should be banned in restaurants, and that state laws enforcing this ban must be enforced. Allowing smoking in these establishments presents serious health risks for both customers and employees. Secondhand smoke—the smoke exhaled by smokers and that released from burning tobacco—contains more than 70 known carcinogens and can lead to lung cancer, heart disease, and various other major health problems.For example, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) discovered that nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke in their workplaces are at a higher risk of developing smoking-related illnesses compared to those who work in smoke-free settings. Additionally, restaurants that permit smoking can become hotspots for respiratory issues, as enclosed areas tend to trap smoke, making the air even more hazardous to inhale.Furthermore, banning smoking in restaurants can yield economic advantages. Smoke-free laws often attract more customers, as many diners actively seek out smoke-free options. In fact, numerous restaurants that have adopted smoke-free policies have reported a boost in business and improved health for their employees.In summary, banning smoking in restaurants is vital for ensuring a healthy atmosphere for both patrons and staff. It is imperative that state laws upholding this ban are diligently enforced to mitigate the dangers of secondhand smoke and promote a healthier community. By maintaining smoke-free dining environments, we can decrease the incidence of smoking-related illnesses, enhance air quality, and provide a more enjoyable dining experience for all. Ultimately, enforcing these laws is essential for safeguarding public health and advancing a smoke-free society.
214;Do you agree that people should have hobbies and do physical activities that are very different from one's work?;"Whether or not people should have hobbies and do physical activities has been a controversial question. Different people have different ideas. Some people think we should focus on our jobs, but I don't agree with them. Having one's own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits.First, having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit. Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze, so doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted. My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company. He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise. When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend, he made up his mind to loose weight. He started to jog every morning. After a moth, he is thinner and finds a girlfriend.Also, doing something for a long time can be boring, having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind. For example, at school, students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class. Humans are not robots; we can't keep working for twenty-four hours. Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries.Last, we should develop at least one personal hobby, not to show off, but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured. Playing musical instrument is a good way, I can play classical guitar. When I meet difficulties in studies, I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves. It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence.Although it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies, but doing so can bring us a healthy body, a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness. Hence, I think it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work.";I firmly believe that individuals should pursue hobbies and participate in physical activities that differ significantly from their professional responsibilities. Engaging in a diverse array of interests and activities outside of work can greatly enhance both physical and mental well-being. When people partake in pursuits that contrast with their job demands, they can relieve themselves from the mental and physical strains of work, allowing for rejuvenation and renewed focus.Exploring various hobbies and physical endeavors can also spark creativity by introducing individuals to new experiences, challenges, and perspectives. For example, a software developer who enjoys painting or a teacher passionate about music may find fresh sources of inspiration and innovative ideas that can benefit their careers. Additionally, participating in diverse activities can cultivate a range of skills, such as problem-solving, collaboration, and time management, all of which are valuable in both personal and professional settings.Moreover, engaging in different interests helps achieve a healthy work-life balance, mitigating the risk of burnout and enhancing overall job satisfaction. It allows individuals to cultivate an identity beyond their professional persona, fostering a sense of fulfillment and purpose that isn't solely tied to their work achievements. Furthermore, pursuing physical activities outside of one’s job can promote better physical health, decrease stress, and elevate mood, contributing to an improved quality of life.In summary, nurturing hobbies and partaking in physical activities that diverge from one's job is crucial for achieving a healthy work-life balance, encouraging creativity, and safeguarding overall well-being. Such pursuits offer avenues for relaxation, self-expression, and personal development, leading to a more satisfying and well-rounded life. Thus, it is immensely beneficial for individuals to seek out and cherish a variety of interests beyond their professional duties.
215;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.;The population explosion results in the high demands of transportation. Many countries have suffered from pollution, noisy and casualty for a long time. From my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons.First and foremost, we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents. The buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia. Moreover, the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing. Most importantly, there are many accidents happening on the roads. For example, in my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents. Each year, Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan.Secondly, investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work. Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads. For instance, I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home. It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour. In contrast, if the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions. Last but not least, spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality. All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes. Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried. We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities. What's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier.In a nutshell, the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable. I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing.;The ongoing debate about whether governments should dedicate more funds to upgrading roads and highways or enhancing public transportation continues to spark discussion. I believe that prioritizing investment in public transportation is essential. A well-developed public transit system brings numerous advantages, such as reduced traffic congestion, lower air pollution levels, and increased economic productivity.To begin with, investing in public transportation can significantly ease traffic congestion on our roads and highways. By offering efficient and dependable alternatives like buses, trains, and subways, commuters are more likely to choose these options over personal vehicles, which ultimately lessens the number of cars on the road. As a result, we can expect reduced travel times, lower fuel consumption, and decreased vehicle emissions. Cities like Tokyo and New York serve as prime examples, having successfully established comprehensive public transit systems that lead to less traffic congestion and improved air quality.Additionally, a strong public transportation network can positively affect the environment. By accommodating a larger number of passengers, public transit reduces the reliance on personal vehicles, which contributes to a decline in carbon emissions. Furthermore, many urban areas are now adopting energy-efficient technologies, such as electric or hybrid buses and trains, thereby further contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and aiding in the fight against climate change.In summary, while it is crucial to improve roads and highways, I strongly advocate for greater government investment in public transportation. This strategy will foster a transportation network that is sustainable, efficient, and environmentally considerate, yielding multiple benefits for both the economy and the planet. A well-designed public transportation system ultimately enhances the quality of life for citizens, making it a strategic investment for governments to pursue.
216;Some people believe that the best way of learning life is by listening to the advice of family and friends. Other people believe that the best way of learning about life is through personal experience. Compare the advantages of these two different ways of learning about life. Which do you think is preferable?;Life is full of challenges, difficulties and unexpected obstacles. Therefore, learning about life, which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed. Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience. Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages.On one hand, the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter. Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life. And friends, people who are the same generation with you, they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you, which is not. By listening to your family and friends advice, you can definitely avoid many unexpected things.On the other hand, finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature. For one thing, there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don't experience it by yourself. For example, a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous. If you did as he told, you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely. In addition, family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time. You will grow to be dependent and reliant. In contrast, free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose.According to myself, both ways are good, but I prefer the latter. It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable. I believe that experiencing the real life by myself, I could learn more than just obey the advice. Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves, why don't the younger try to do the same?In summary, each way learning life has its own benefits. But to me, learning about life through personal experience seems more appropriate.;The question of the most effective way to understand life has ignited a long-standing discussion. Some argue that following the advice of family and friends is the ideal method, while others contend that personal experience holds the key to life’s lessons. Each approach has its merits, but upon reflection, I contend that personal experience is the superior path to learning about life.Taking advice from family and friends certainly comes with its advantages. It enables individuals to gain valuable insights and helps them avoid pitfalls that others have already encountered. Those close to us can provide support and guidance, offering a safety net when it's needed most. Additionally, their counsel is often rooted in their own life experiences, which can be instrumental in tackling various challenges.Conversely, learning through personal experience presents several significant benefits. It fosters problem-solving skills, independence, and self-sufficiency. Confronting challenges and making mistakes allow individuals to learn and develop rapidly. Personal experiences also encourage the formation of unique perspectives and opinions, rather than merely adopting those of others. Moreover, this approach nurtures resilience, adaptability, and creativity—crucial traits for achieving success in life.Ultimately, while there are valid points to consider in listening to family and friends, I strongly believe that personal experience is the more effective way to navigate life. It empowers individuals to cultivate essential skills, independence, and self-awareness. Although it may entail making mistakes and facing difficulties, the lessons derived from personal experience are invaluable, shaping us into capable and confident individuals. In the end, personal experience stands as the best teacher, revealing the truths that allow us to truly learn and grow.
217;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.;Everyone has happy moments during their life. These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood. In my opinion, childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.First, in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood. They do not have to worry about bills, jobs, how would their life be in the future. They just worry about two things: to have fun, learn and be happy. A child's daily life is school, playing and sleeping. For example, when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood. Moreover, I did not have to worry about costs and other things, I just had fun and learned. Also, people are most creative when they were children, children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy.Second, childhood is the period where people go to school and learn. Therefore, school memories are one of the best memories in a person's life. There you learn, to find your first love, to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun. For example, my father's best moments in his life are in his school years. Moreover, he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories.In other words, childhood is, indeed, the most happiest moments in a person's life. There is only one life and one childhood and people should live their childhood thoroughly.;"The assertion that ""childhood is the happiest time of a person's life"" is a matter of considerable discussion. While some individuals firmly believe this to be true, others contest the claim. Personally, I find myself in agreement with this idea to a certain degree.Childhood is often seen as a blissful and innocent period, free from the burdens and anxieties of adult life. During this phase, children have the freedom to explore, learn, and play without the stresses associated with earning a living or supporting a family. They are typically surrounded by caring family members and friends who attend to their needs, providing a sense of safety and comfort. Additionally, this stage of life is marked by a sense of wonder and exploration, as children encounter new experiences and develop their understanding of the world with curiosity and amazement.That being said, it is crucial to recognize that childhood can also be a challenging time for some. Numerous children encounter hardships such as poverty, abuse, and neglect, which can significantly affect their happiness and overall well-being. Furthermore, some may face learning disabilities, social anxieties, or other issues that can hinder their joy during these formative years.In summary, while childhood can certainly be a joyful and idyllic time for many, it does not hold that status for everyone. Individual experiences and circumstances can vary widely, making happiness a subjective and personal journey. Nonetheless, for a considerable number of people, childhood represents a period of joy, and it is common to feel nostalgic for this carefree time. Ultimately, the happiness associated with childhood depends on a multitude of factors, and it is up to each person to forge their own joyful memories and experiences, regardless of their age."
218;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;With technology advances, food has become easier to prepare in modern days. People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before. Also, instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals. These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent.First of all, people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming. For instance, such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job. On the other hand, more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts.At the second point, since food preparation has become easier and more convenient, it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home. People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like. More men, on the other hand, are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before. This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases.In conclusion, the time-saving, simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities, more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals. Of course, there may be some other perspectives that I neglected to fully consider. Nevertheless, for the reasons that I have presented above, I would assert that this change has improved our life significantly.;The emergence of modern technology and culinary advancements has undoubtedly simplified and enhanced the process of preparing food. This transformation has greatly impacted daily life, providing a multitude of benefits that promote overall well-being and lifestyle improvements. One of the key benefits is the significant time savings. With options like pre-cut vegetables, microwave meals, and instant cooking gadgets, people can whip up meals in no time, freeing them to dedicate more hours to work, education, and leisure pursuits.Additionally, there has been a marked improvement in the accessibility of diverse cuisines and nutritional choices. Meal kits and delivery services allow individuals to delve into various culinary experiences without requiring extensive cooking skills or lengthy preparation times. This variety in diet encourages a more balanced and healthier eating pattern, which supports improved physical and mental health. For instance, a busy professional can conveniently order a nutritious meal online, ensuring they maintain a wholesome diet despite their packed schedule.Moreover, the simplification of food preparation has led to both social and economic advantages. It allows individuals to better manage their grocery budgets by purchasing ingredients or meals in appropriate portions, thus minimizing food waste and cutting costs. Furthermore, the convenience of contemporary food preparation methods has paved the way for new business opportunities and job creation within the food delivery and preparation industry, enhancing local economies.In summary, the current ease of food preparation has significantly transformed lifestyles for the better. It provides the dual advantages of time savings and access to a wide array of healthy and exciting food choices. As technology and culinary science progress, it's likely that the benefits of straightforward food preparation will continue to grow, further improving quality of life for people worldwide.
219;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Learning to be independent is essential for young adults. However, how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue. In my point of view, staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult. My opinion is based on creating memories with parents, saving money, and taking advice from parents.First of all, one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents. The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age. When having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown. If he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together. All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by. Thus, I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile.Furthermore, living at home costs less than living outside. Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home. Therefore, he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents. Moreover, another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings. Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be. In a word, the parents can save money, if their children live with them longer.The third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother's suggestions. When in dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand. They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way. If the parents do not help him immediately, he would have to suffer more pain. Hence, taking advice from parents, the young adult can go through obstacles easily.To sum up, living with parents longer brings about memories with parents, less cost, and advice from parents. Hence, staying longer with parents is a better choice.;The ongoing discussion about whether young adults should pursue independence from their parents at an early age or remain living with their families for an extended period has garnered significant attention. Personally, I contend that staying with family for a longer duration offers greater advantages for young adults.On one hand, residing with parents can afford young adults financial stability and security. For example, many universities and colleges mandate that students have a permanent address, which can easily be fulfilled by living at home. Moreover, parents can provide vital emotional support and guidance, assisting their children in navigating the complexities of young adulthood. For instance, a young adult pursuing higher education may draw valuable insights and experience from their parents when making crucial life decisions.Conversely, seeking independence too soon can result in unnecessary stress and challenges. Numerous young adults who leave their parents' homes prematurely find themselves grappling with financial issues, such as covering rent and bills, which may force them to sacrifice their educational or career aspirations. For instance, a young adult juggling a part-time job to make ends meet may lack the time or energy needed to explore their passions or interests.In conclusion, while the pursuit of independence is a vital aspect of maturation, I assert that residing with family longer can supply young adults with the necessary support and stability to thrive. By staying with their parents, young adults can concentrate on their educational and career objectives without the weight of financial strain, while also benefiting from the love and wisdom of their family. Ultimately, this arrangement can pave the way for a more successful and fulfilling life.
220;Do you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and example to explain your answer.;Some people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization, which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily. However, I do not agree with them. I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings. It is very crucial for learning. It helps animals out of extinction. Also, it is a interesting travel location.First of all, the zoo gives humans new knowledge. When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals, what should you do if there were no zoo? Inevitably, the zoo is the important place for innate learning. The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically. They are able to observe animals' behaviors and features. Moreover, practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class. Besides, researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals.Secondly, the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats. In the zoo, there is not so harmful as a forest. They, fed by zookeepers, do not need to find food themselves. Furthermore, we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife.Last but not least, because of all weird, acute, and beautiful animals in the zoo, it can be a great tourist attraction. There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely. If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists, it will receive a great deal of money. That also make money flow, and then economics become better. It benefits to a certain country. In conclusion, the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction, but also helps people around the world have better lives. I firmly believe that the zoo is so useful for the earth.;I contest the notion that zoos serve no valuable purpose. While some may perceive them simply as entertainment venues, I argue that they are essential for conservation, education, and research. A key function of a zoo is to create a secure environment for endangered species, which frequently face threats from habitat loss, pollution, and poaching. For example, the giant panda breeding programs in zoos have successfully bolstered the population of this beloved species, which was once on the verge of extinction.Moreover, zoos function as educational centers where visitors can discover the significance of conservation and the effects of human activities on the natural world. Many zoos provide interactive exhibits and programs designed to raise awareness about the struggles faced by various species and the necessity of protecting their habitats. The conservation initiatives at the San Diego Zoo, for instance, have informed millions of visitors about the importance of preserving polar bears and their environments, which are currently at risk due to climate change.Additionally, zoos offer a platform for scientific research, which can guide conservation efforts and enhance our understanding of animal behavior, physiology, and ecology. By observing animals in regulated settings, zoos assist researchers in devising effective conservation strategies and enhancing the management of wild populations. The examination of animal behavior within zoos has aided scientists in developing more successful reintroduction programs for species such as wolves and bears.In summary, I strongly assert that zoos have a significant purpose, encompassing conservation, education, and research. By providing a safe refuge for endangered species, enlightening visitors about conservation efforts, and fostering scientific inquiry, zoos greatly contribute to biodiversity preservation and the safeguarding of our planet's cherished wildlife. Far from lacking a useful purpose, zoos play an integral role in promoting animal welfare and the overall health of our environment.
221;Parents are the best teacher for young children. To what extend do you argee or disagree?;It is obvious that parents are the first teachers who teach babies how to walk and speak and make children to become a good person. Moreover, parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children's future life.First, children are taught basic things, which influence their whole life, by their parents. As a baby, they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents. Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that. Consequently, parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby's little mind.Second, parents train their child how to become a good person. They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way. On the one hand, it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person. On the other hand, children are shown how to behave well with others. This seems to be easy but this can influence positively their future children and makes children's behavior better before they face the real world.Third, it is clear that parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children. Thus, they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children. Unlike a professional, parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life. In fact, parents' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life.In conclusion, parents are really the best teachers who give us much knowledge and advice. Based on love, they always try their best to make good condition for their children development in order to prepare children's future life.;The idea that parents serve as the best educators for young children has gained considerable attention in recent years. Some believe parents are crucial to a child's educational development, while others argue that professional teachers are more qualified to deliver a well-rounded education. I partially agree that parents are indeed the best teachers for young children.On one hand, parents have a distinct advantage in their ability to teach due to the deep bond and trust they share with their children. They can provide personalized attention, which is especially beneficial for young learners who need guidance and support during their formative years. Furthermore, parents are uniquely positioned to instill essential values, morals, and cultural norms, all of which are vital for the child's social and emotional growth.Conversely, parents may lack the necessary skills or expertise to teach certain subjects as children advance in their education. Professional educators, having undergone extensive training, possess the knowledge required to offer a comprehensive educational experience. Additionally, teachers are better equipped to identify and address learning challenges and to create a structured, disciplined learning environment that promotes academic achievement.In summary, while parents play a crucial role in the early education of their children, I believe they are not the sole or necessarily the best educators. A collaborative model, where parents and professional teachers work in tandem, is likely to produce the most favorable outcomes for children. By fostering a supportive and nurturing environment, and harnessing the strengths of both parents and educators, we can provide young children with a well-rounded education that sets them up for future success. Ultimately, the combination of parental love and professional teaching is the key to achieving the most effective learning results.
222;Some people say that television has a bad influence to young children. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we have undergone many technology innovations such as Tv. Many people say that television has negative effects on children, since it can be violent or inappropriate for children. However, I strongly believe that television has more positive effects than negative effects. There are two reasons to support my idea.First of all, television has useful and educational programs. Not only the up-to-date news, but also there are many programs which has educational purposes. If children can use those programs wisely, they can learn many information from it. For example, in Korea, there's program called EBS. It is targeted for children to teenager. We can study subjects through EBS lecture. Also, there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea. Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects. In addition, Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses. There are many Tv programs such as sports programs. Many children have a lot of stresses recently, since they have so much pressure about study. When they are watching sports programs, it's easy to relieve those stresses. As an example, I got too much stress from the school. So, I was quite aggressive, however. After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan, the stress was gone. Instead, this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school, since it helped me to relieve my stress.In conclusion, of course, the television can have violent programs, however, if children can use Tv programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects. Now that, it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children. For these reasons, I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children.;The effects of television on young children have long been a matter of concern. While some people believe that television negatively impacts children, I contend that excessive viewing can indeed harm their development.On one hand, television can serve as a valuable tool for education and entertainment. Numerous programs, such as Sesame Street and National Geographic, offer children important knowledge and skills. Additionally, television can introduce young viewers to various cultures, traditions, and lifestyles, enhancing their understanding of the world.Conversely, too much television exposure can result in several adverse effects. For example, viewing violent or aggressive content may encourage similar behaviors in children. Moreover, spending excessive time in front of the screen can promote a sedentary lifestyle, leading to obesity and other health issues. Advertising on television can also push unhealthy foods and products, shaping children’s eating habits and consumer choices.In summary, while television has the potential to be a beneficial resource for children, I believe that excessive viewing poses significant risks. Parents and caregivers should supervise children's television consumption and prioritize educational and informative programming. By doing so, we can reduce the negative impacts of television while enhancing its benefits. Ultimately, a balanced and mindful approach to television viewing is crucial for fostering healthy development and well-being in children.
223;Businesses should hire employees for their entire lives. Do you agree or disagree. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;Many entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working. From my perspective, those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date. I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons. First and foremost, various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish. The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job, but regularly give out creative and novel ideas. What's more, the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge. Therefore, the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards. More importantly, they have activeness, inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly. These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not.Secondly, the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time. At a certain time, they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life. Thereafter, the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also. Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones. The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed, so this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise. Last but not least, the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment. In my opinion, the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue. It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living. Furthermore, the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas. In a nutshell, varied characteristics of various people, feeling tired of having the same occupation and solving the unemployed problem drive me to agree with the statement that the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life. I believe that the brilliant bosses are conscious of the need for giving opportunities to diverse employees.;I take issue with the idea that companies should employ individuals for their entire careers. Although job security is important, lifetime employment can produce adverse effects for both employers and employees.One major concern is that it can foster complacency among staff. When employees believe their jobs are permanent, they may lack the motivation to innovate, refine their skills, or work effectively. For example, Japan's traditional lifetime employment system, which was once praised for promoting loyalty and commitment, has faced criticism for creating a complacent workforce.Additionally, lifetime employment can limit a company's capacity to adapt to evolving market demands. Businesses must be agile and responsive to changes in consumer preferences, technological advancements, and economic shifts. A lifetime employment policy might deter companies from letting go of underperforming staff or reorganizing their teams, even when such actions are vital for the company's survival. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many organizations swiftly altered their operations to remain viable, and those with flexible workforces were generally more successful in navigating the crisis compared to those bound by inflexible lifetime employment arrangements.Moreover, lifetime employment can stifle employees' career advancement and personal development. Being tethered to a single employer throughout one's career can result in missed opportunities for acquiring new experiences, honing skills, and progressing in one's profession. This stagnation can lead to dissatisfaction and decreased productivity among employees.In summary, while job security is vital, the concept of lifetime employment is not a practical or advantageous solution for employers or employees. Businesses should prioritize fostering a supportive and inclusive workplace that promotes employee growth, innovation, and fulfillment rather than committing to lifetime job guarantees.
224;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.;"I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one's life. It's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think.Starting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives. We are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave. Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community. But during our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to. Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult. Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day. Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you. There are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see. Therefore, childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most.Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child. Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination. In adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination.Childhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives. It's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults. In an ideal world with less boundaries, social judgement and more freedom of thought, things could be different; but since this is not the case, it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days.";I concur that childhood represents the happiest phase of a person’s life. During this time, individuals experience a sense of freedom and innocence that greatly enhances their happiness. Children are free from the burdens and stresses that come with adulthood—like financial responsibilities, job pressures, and complicated relationships. This liberation allows them to relish simple joys, such as playing with friends, reading, and exploring their environment, all without the weight of adult worries.Consider a child’s delight on their birthday or their sheer joy upon receiving a new toy. These experiences encapsulate genuine happiness and excitement, untainted by the intricacies of adult life. Moreover, children's constant learning and discovery instill in them a sense of wonder and anticipation. Their imaginations and creativity flourish, enabling them to dream big and envision endless possibilities.In stark contrast, as people age, they often become disillusioned and cynical, losing the sense of joy and wonder that characterized their childhood. The adult pressures can be overwhelming, leading to stress and anxiety that dent their happiness. Additionally, the loss of innocence and the harsh realities of the world contribute to a decline in overall contentment. For these reasons, I strongly assert that childhood is indeed the happiest time in a person's life—a period marked by unrestrained joy, curiosity, and freedom from adult complexities.
225;Learning about the past has no value on for those of us living the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Many people think that ""Past has nothing to do with present, as time never stops, the next generations are completely different from the predecessors"". Although it is true that life changes rapidly, there are many things in the past that we can learn about, such as mistakes, success and knowledge in many fields of study. First of all, the predecessors' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past. As everyone's life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare, we all should learn about other's mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones. Each mistake, from the smallest to the bigger one, is a treasure of experience, which, if we can make full use of, will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life. Therefore, past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times.Secondly, people's success in the past is as significant as those mistakes. If the predecessors' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals, others' accomplishment can be served as the direct way. By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets, we have the chance to make those mine, put them into practice and, of course, be successful like them. For instance, Edison's statement ""Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration"" is still helpful for everyone today, and probably in the future. Last but not least, the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge, inventions. If it had not been for those knowledge in the past, we could never be as modern as today. How can America be the world's leading country if Columbus did not accidentally discover it in his search for India. How can the comtemporary scientists study the earth's gravity without the apple which fall on Newton's head. They are only some of many precious knowledge that the past presents us. We cannot ignore them in any way.All in all, the past's mistakes, success and knowledge all have crucial impact on people's lives today. We should make full use of the past, instead of ignoring it, for a better and brighter future.";"I completely reject the idea that studying history offers no value to those of us in the present. Understanding our past is crucial for navigating the complexities of today's world. By delving into history, we can uncover important insights into the roots and repercussions of major events, which can guide our present-day choices and actions.For example, the lessons derived from historical events such as World War II highlight the perils of nationalism, xenophobia, and totalitarianism. Additionally, the civil rights movement of the 1960s has fueled today's social justice movements, showcasing the strength of collective action and resilience amid challenges. By reflecting on these experiences, we can gain a richer understanding of the intricacies of human behavior, politics, and society.Moreover, historical awareness acts as a springboard for innovation and progress. Many contemporary technologies and scientific breakthroughs are built upon the foundations laid by previous discoveries and inventions. Take the internet, for instance; its development owes much to earlier advancements in computer networks and telecommunications. By examining the past, we can acknowledge the contributions of trailblazers and leverage their achievements to foster future innovations.In summary, learning about our history transcends mere academic inquiry; it is essential for effectively engaging with the present. It enriches our understanding of the world, influences our choices, and motivates us to create a better future. By embracing our collective history, we can cultivate a more informed, empathetic, and progressive society. Thus, I firmly believe that studying the past holds immense significance for those navigating the present."
226;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;Space exploration, for discovery of out of space, has been possible for human in the 20th century. The United state and Russia are the important countries that spend large budgets for the research of this subject. In my opinion, spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future. Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget, while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living. In 20th century, although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets, but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now. In during history, our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity. Therefore, it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets. Space exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war. In the future, many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles. In the past, the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union. Both countries tried to send man to the moon and show their power to each other. As a result, space exploration will use as a military power for many countries.In summary, spending budget for space exploring is not the waste budget, because it may helps to save civilization of humanity. Although exploring space used for discovery of other planets, nowadays most of governments have used many rockets for military purposes and therefore the purposes of exploring space has altered.;Governments' investments in space travel have ignited a vigorous debate in recent years. While some critics view it as a misallocation of resources, I am convinced that such investments are both reasonable and justified. The advantages of space exploration, in my view, significantly surpass the associated costs.To begin with, space exploration has led to a range of scientific advancements and innovations that enhance our everyday lives. A prime example is the development of GPS technology, which owes its existence to space research and has transformed how we navigate and communicate. Additionally, the exploration of space has propelled progress in various fields, including medicine, telecommunications, and environmental science.Furthermore, I believe that investing in space travel is prudent because it holds the potential to secure the long-term survival of humanity. As we confront environmental challenges and dwindling resources on Earth, space exploration could offer viable solutions. By investigating and possibly colonizing other planets, we can safeguard the future of our species and unlock new avenues for resource acquisition and economic development.Moreover, the investment in space travel has spurred the creation of new industries and job opportunities, contributing positively to the economy. The space industry is currently valued in the billions and is projected to expand dramatically in the coming years. This expansion not only promises new employment opportunities but also fosters innovation and entrepreneurial ventures.In summary, although the financial commitment to space travel may seem steep, I argue that it is a justifiable and essential investment for humanity's progress. The myriad benefits of space exploration, ranging from scientific advancements to economic development, make it a worthwhile endeavor. As we continue to explore the frontiers of space, we are likely to discover new opportunities and face challenges that will greatly influence the future of our planet and beyond.
227;Do you agree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.Ê;"Television is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day. Besides, watching television has some cons and at the same time has very good pros. However, while some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families, I believe it has done the opposite. I think TV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering. In addition Modern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people.First, it's true watching TV take a lot of your day, nevertheless it makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs.Second, people like having meals while they are watching TV. Families usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends. For example my friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights. It was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema. Third, TV can be one of communication ways. Moreover, TV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV, WDTV using Skype, tango and other apps. In addition Teenagers can play games online with their friends; therefore we can communicate with each other through TV. To sum up, TV may take some of your time away from your family and friends but it can also make family get together and help to get in conversation. As well as it's one way of recent communications, based on that I think TV helps you to get connected with people.";I have a mixed view on the claim that television has undermined communication among friends and family. While it's evident that excessive TV watching can impede face-to-face interactions, I don't believe it is the only factor contributing to the decline in communication.On one hand, television can indeed pose a barrier to meaningful interactions. When people come together in front of the screen, they often become absorbed in the program, watching in silence instead of connecting with one another. This can result in fewer deep, personal discussions and a feeling of emotional distance. For example, a family might spend an entire evening watching a movie without exchanging a single word, missing valuable opportunities to bond and express their thoughts and feelings.Conversely, television can also serve as a unifying force. Many people enjoy watching TV shows or sports events with their loved ones, creating shared experiences that can lead to lively conversations and a sense of togetherness. For instance, tuning into a major sporting event or a trending show can spark discussions and debates, ultimately strengthening relationships.In summary, although television can be a barrier to communication, it is not the only factor eroding communication among friends and family. It is essential for individuals to find a balance between screen time and engaging in meaningful conversations with those they care about. By being aware of our television consumption and making a conscious effort to interact with one another, we can ensure that TV enriches, rather than replaces, our human connections.
228;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship.Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship. It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result. However, I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend, although mistake is terrible. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my opinion. First of all, a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever. Anybody does not remember mistakes. If someone remembers mistake, he or she has a closed mind. I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly. For example, my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift. However, I forgot about it just after two days, and I felt at peace with him. Some people might say I am silly, but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship. Second, Everybody makes mistake. However, if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake, there will be no friends around you. I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake, we will need to end a friendship. However, when the mistake friend made was not a big problem, we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life. According to a research, 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend.I think that a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big because friendship is forever and gift our life.;I believe that allowing a friend to make a mistake is often preferable to taking action that could jeopardize the friendship. While the desire to intervene and prevent a friend from making a poor choice can be strong, doing so can create feelings of resentment and harm the relationship. Friends cherish their independence, and being directed on what to do may come off as controlling or condescending.For example, if a friend is contemplating a dubious business venture, one might feel compelled to dissuade them. However, if they are set on proceeding, trying to intervene could provoke defensiveness and emotional hurt. By letting them make their own decision, even if it leads to a misstep, you provide them with an invaluable opportunity to learn and grow. This approach also conveys that you respect their judgment and trust their capacity to make choices.Furthermore, taking steps to prevent a friend from erring can diminish their confidence and self-esteem. When they sense that you don’t trust them to make sound decisions, it can cause them to question their abilities, which ultimately erodes their sense of independence. By allowing friends to navigate their own mistakes, we affirm our belief in their capabilities and show that we are willing to support them, even in their misjudgments. This approach not only fortifies the friendship but also fosters personal growth through shared experiences. In summary, although it can be challenging to allow a friend to stumble, it is often more beneficial for the friendship than taking action that may lead to its unraveling.
229;One of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;Nowadays, the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before, parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them, just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods. Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that, for example, asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves. In my views, I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons.First of all, when children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents. Thus, it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money. Take me as an example, when I was 16, I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own. At the beginning of the semester, I was told to buy a text book. Unfortunately, I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend. Therefore, I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money, and that did influence me in my life now.Secondly, by taking a part-time job, they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done. For instance, if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him. To compare with the school life, they might suffer only a small punishment at school. Under the circumstances, he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work.In conclusion, to help their children to adapt adult life, parents should let them experience it as much as they can. Due to the reasons given above, to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life.;One of the most effective ways parents can help their teenage children transition into adulthood is by encouraging them to seek part-time employment. This opportunity equips teenagers with essential skills while instilling a sense of responsibility and independence. Through part-time work, they learn crucial life skills like time management, effective communication, and teamwork.Additionally, having a job teaches teenagers about financial management. When they earn their own money, they gain an appreciation for hard work and learn to make informed choices regarding saving and spending. This experience is vital in preparing them for the financial aspects of adult life. Furthermore, working part-time exposes teenagers to a variety of career options, helping them identify their interests and strengths, which can guide their future educational and career paths.Beyond practical skills, part-time employment can significantly boost a teenager's self-esteem and confidence. Achieving success in a work environment enhances their self-image, fostering a sense of capability and self-reliance. This newfound confidence can positively influence their academic performance and overall well-being.Moreover, encouraging teens to take on part-time jobs reflects parents' trust in their abilities, which is crucial for their emotional and psychological growth. It demonstrates that parents believe in their capacity to handle responsibilities and make sound decisions, promoting a sense of autonomy and self-sufficiency.In summary, promoting part-time job opportunities for teenagers is one of the most beneficial ways parents can prepare them for adult life. It provides them with valuable skills, financial literacy, and a sense of independence and self-worth. By offering support and guidance in this journey, parents can empower their teenagers to navigate the challenges of adulthood with confidence and competence.
230;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay.;It’s certainly better for children to grow up in a big city. Of course you need to choose a good neighborhood. I hold this belief because of two main reasons, academic and social reasons.Some people thinks that if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video-game, but this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did. My friends and I used to play soccer, bike, climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day. We did play video-games, but that wasn't our main activity. In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do.I have a friend that grew up in the countryside. He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university. This is another downside of growing up in the countryside. In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology.Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience, you won’t know a lot of people, there are gossips everywhere, and your life will be really limited. If someday I have children, I’m absolutely sure that they will grow up in a good neighborhood of a big city and they will be very happy about it.;The ongoing debate regarding whether children should be raised in rural areas or large cities has captured attention for many years. While some people contend that urban settings provide greater opportunities and conveniences, I strongly believe that growing up in the countryside is far more advantageous for children.To begin with, the countryside presents a safer and healthier environment conducive to children's growth and development. With cleaner air and water, along with a slower pace of life, the risks of accidents and stress-related issues are significantly reduced. For example, children in rural areas are more likely to participate in outdoor activities like hiking and cycling, which contribute to their physical health and overall well-being. In contrast, urban living often involves dealing with pollution, noise, and congested streets, which can negatively affect a child's health.Additionally, a key benefit of rural upbringing is the stronger sense of community and social ties. In smaller towns, neighbors typically know one another and provide mutual support, creating a nurturing environment for children. This is especially important as it fosters essential social skills, including communication, empathy, and cooperation. Moreover, the countryside encourages children to connect with nature, which has been linked to improved mental health and cognitive development.In summary, although cities may offer a range of amenities and opportunities, I maintain that a rural upbringing is more beneficial for children. The healthier and safer environment, stronger community bonds, and increased interaction with nature make the countryside an ideal setting for their growth and development. Thus, I firmly advocate for the countryside as a more suitable place for children to be raised compared to a bustling city.
231;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I completely agree that parents are the best teacher. Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children’s lives.Firstly, the things that parents say have great power to their child. More power than any friend or other adult could have. For example, if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn't do it, but his father told him/her that it was right, the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person, even if his father is wrong.Secondly, a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people, so their parents have more time to teach him/her than anybody else. They have more contact and more intimacy with their children. Lastly, children usually mirror themselves on their parents. That’s as important thing because even if the parents don’t intend to teach their children something, they are always observing and learning by themselves. So, if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad, his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad.All in all, I agree that parents are the greatest teachers and I think that they should be very careful with what they say and do in front of their child, because it can define who he is going to be.;I wholeheartedly concur with the idea that parents are the finest teachers. From an early age, children view their parents as role models and absorb countless important lessons from them. Parents possess a distinctive ability to influence their child's personality, values, and beliefs, establishing them as the most impactful educators in a child's life.One key reason parents excel as teachers is their capacity to offer tailored guidance and support. Unlike school teachers, who must address the diverse needs of a whole classroom, parents can concentrate on their child's individual strengths, weaknesses, and preferred learning styles. For example, if a child faces challenges in a particular subject, a parent can provide personalized tutoring, helping them navigate their struggles. Furthermore, parents can equip their children with essential life skills—such as cooking, cleaning, and time management—that are crucial for fostering independence and self-reliance.Additionally, parents serve as effective teachers by offering concrete examples and hands-on experiences. Children learn through observation and imitation, and parents can utilize daily life situations to impart valuable lessons. For instance, a parent can demonstrate the importance of honesty by exemplifying it in their actions or teach the value of hard work through their dedication to supporting the family. Furthermore, parents can instill their cultural heritage, traditions, and values in their children, cultivating a strong sense of identity and belonging.In summary, parents play a crucial role in their child's education and growth. With their personalized support, practical examples, and unwavering love, parents undeniably emerge as the best teachers. They hold the remarkable ability to inspire, motivate, and guide their children, nurturing them into capable, confident, and compassionate individuals.
232;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;The Technology has developed a lot. With that development, food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to. With that change, people’s lives are a lot better for several reasons. Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook.Firstly, people normally have lots of things to do. Because of that, they don’t have much time to spend in the kitchen. But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome. For example, if an engineer needs to make a project, but he needs to deliver it tomorrow, he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch.Secondly, when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason, some time ago he/she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food, but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food. For example, if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions. Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time.All in all, that ease to prepare food has improved people’s lives. And that happened mainly because of the development of the technology. But people should be careful with what they eat, because some industrial foods are very bad for their health, so they should buy only food from well known brands.;The introduction of convenient food preparation techniques has transformed modern living. The emergence of ready-to-eat meals, microwaveable options, and meal delivery services has made cooking quicker and simpler than ever. This shift has undeniably enhanced people's lives by saving them considerable time and effort.One of the key benefits of easy food preparation is the time it frees up. In today's fast-paced environment, many individuals lead hectic lives, leaving scant time for cooking. Convenient food choices enable people to whip up a meal in no time, allowing them to focus on other important areas of their lives, such as work, family, or leisure. For example, a busy professional can now simply heat a pre-cooked meal in the microwave, enjoying a healthy dinner in just minutes.Furthermore, convenient food preparation has expanded dietary choices for those with demanding schedules. With a wide array of pre-prepared meals available, individuals can now explore various cuisines and dishes that they might not have the time or expertise to create themselves. This not only enriches their dining experiences but also introduces them to new flavors and culinary cultures. Meal delivery services further enhance this experience by allowing people to savor their favorite foods from home, thus improving their overall quality of life.In summary, the simplicity of food preparation has significantly affected how people live. By saving time, offering a diverse range of dietary options, and enriching dining experiences, convenient food preparation methods have elevated the quality of life for those with busy lifestyles. As society continues to accelerate, the significance of easy food preparation will only become more pronounced.
233;Students should be required to take regular standardized tests to prove that they are learning;The issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams. This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it. However, I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge.Firstly, standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students. For example some students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue. Therefore, exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students. In addition, many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them.Additionally, standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice. Since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, so they will never try to solve problems on their own. However, standardized tests offer them such chance. Thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides.Finally, I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students. In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively. I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don’t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them.Ultimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right. I belive this, due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students.;The discussion around the necessity of regular standardized testing for students has persisted for years. Some critics contend that these assessments are redundant and induce unnecessary stress, while supporters argue that they are essential for evaluating academic progress. In this essay, I will contend that students should indeed be mandated to take regular standardized tests to demonstrate their learning outcomes.To begin with, standardized tests offer an impartial and consistent way to gauge a student's grasp of specific subjects. These assessments are crafted to evaluate a student's command of essential skills and concepts, allowing educators to pinpoint areas where a student may require further help or revision. Through regular standardized testing, students can showcase their expertise in a subject and receive constructive feedback on aspects needing improvement.Moreover, standardized tests help uphold rigorous academic standards. By making these assessments compulsory, the education system ensures that all students are held to the same criteria and expectations, irrespective of their backgrounds or socioeconomic factors. This fosters equity and fairness in education, guaranteeing that every student has access to equal opportunities and resources.Additionally, standardized tests enable teachers and educators to recognize any shortcomings in their teaching methods. By scrutinizing test results, the education system can identify patterns and trends in student performance, leading to informed decisions about enhancing instruction and supporting student learning. This approach can result in more effective teaching strategies and an improved educational experience for students.In summary, regular standardized tests are an important instrument for assessing academic progress and ensuring that students meet elevated standards. They offer an objective evaluation of student comprehension, promote fairness in education, and highlight areas for instructional improvement. As such, students should be required to participate in regular standardized testing to validate their learning.
234;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars;"A famous proverb “Knowledge is power” has demonstrated the value of education. I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability. I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies, and this left them with only one choice, which is work.University is more likely to become a money making business, the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students. In today’s world education is getting expensive, and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission. Whereas, the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education, they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation, food, traveling, clothing, etc.Moreover, it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance, working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars, they need to concentrate on their studies. MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work, which takes their full concentration and surveys. The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities.Therefore, universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars; their message should be spread education, not making money, and motivate those scholars who want to get education. Their notion should be inspirational in such a way which makes our society educative and increase our literacy rate.";I firmly support the idea that university education should be offered at no cost to all aspiring students. In our contemporary knowledge-driven economy, obtaining a university degree is essential for individuals to gain the skills and expertise needed to succeed in the competitive job market. Providing free access to higher education carries significant advantages for both individuals and society.Firstly, eliminating tuition fees would enhance access to education and promote equality of opportunity. Many talented students are unable to pursue higher education due to financial limitations. By making university education free, we enable these individuals to reach their full potential and contribute positively to society. This initiative would also help narrow the divide between socioeconomic classes, fostering social mobility and diminishing income disparity.Moreover, free university education can lead to significant long-term economic gains. Educated individuals tend to have higher employment rates, earn greater incomes, and contribute more to the tax system, all of which stimulate economic growth. They are also more likely to be innovative and entrepreneurial, driving the creation of new ideas, products, and services that can further economic advancement.While some might contend that implementing free university education is prohibitively expensive and unsustainable, I contend that the long-term advantages far outweigh the associated costs. Governments could consider alternative funding strategies, such as increasing corporate taxes or introducing a wealth tax, to finance this initiative. In summary, offering free university education to all interested students is not only a moral obligation but also an economic necessity. It has the potential to foster a fairer, more innovative, and thriving society, and I strongly advocate for this policy to be pursued.
235;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?Ê;Although professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing, teaching, we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with, doing research. In my opinion, a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following.A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject. He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him/herself forward all the time. And then he or she can do better in teaching works. For instance, the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr. Yang who keeps in researching and reading. He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves. All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA, the excellent teacher.As for students, we can get what we want to know from textbooks, webs or teachers. But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted. If a professor doesn't get any researching works, he cannot give us the opportunity. In addition, a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time. He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions. That is good for both of the professor and students.Finally, all professors in the university are fortune of the society. They are the leaders almost in every fields of science, arts, culture and so on. Without their research, there will be no new technologies come out quickly. Without their research, there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing. Without their research, there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth.In conclusion, a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university. And it's worth to spend more time on it than on teaching.;The role of university professors has sparked considerable discussion, with differing opinions on whether their main focus should be on research or on educating students. In my opinion, university professors should aim for a harmonious balance between these two responsibilities.On one side, conducting research is a vital component of a professor's role. It allows them to remain informed about the latest advancements in their discipline and to contribute to the broader body of knowledge. Professors engaged in research can introduce innovative ideas and perspectives into their classrooms, enhancing the relevance and engagement of their teaching. Additionally, a strong research background can bolster their credibility in the eyes of students.Conversely, the primary duty of university professors is to educate. Students attend universities to acquire knowledge, skills, and mentorship from seasoned professors. Those who prioritize teaching can provide personalized support, guidance, and mentorship, which are crucial for students' academic and personal development. Moreover, effective teaching is essential for cultivating critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills—traits that are highly sought after by employers.In summary, I believe university professors should carefully manage their time to find a balance between research and teaching. While research is important for the progression of knowledge and establishing credibility, teaching is fundamental to the growth and development of students. By effectively balancing these two roles, professors can enhance their effectiveness as educators and play a significant part in shaping the next generation of leaders and professionals. Ultimately, an equilibrium between research and teaching will yield positive outcomes for both professors and their students.
236;How do television or movies influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to explain your answer.;There is no doubt that television or movies influence people’s behavior and they influence us in both bad ways and good ways. But I think in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways. They make people to eat more rubbish food, spend less time with their friends and family, and be someone that are not themselves. There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television. Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas. It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people’s health. Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods. In turn, people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases.Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends, especially children. They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies. When people are watching television or movies together, they also talk less to each other, compare to when playing social games, such as parlor games, together.Television and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements. These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images. When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements, they think that they are ugly. Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body. When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him, then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don’t prefer it.I think television and movies are entertaining but most of the time they influence people’s behavior in bad ways. If you want to stay healthy, be yourself and spend time with your family and friends, then you should spend less time watching these media.;"The impact of television and film on human behavior is a complex and significant topic. These media forms possess the capacity to influence our attitudes, values, and actions in powerful ways. One key aspect of this influence is the emotional bonds we develop with characters and narratives, which can motivate us to embrace new behaviors and perspectives. For instance, films like ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" inspire audiences to take a stand against social injustices or to persist through challenging times.Moreover, the depiction of various lifestyles or behaviors as appealing can also drive this influence. Many TV shows and movies showcase characters engaging in risky or unhealthy activities—such as substance abuse or reckless driving—creating a possibility for viewers, especially the younger generations, to mimic these actions. On the flip side, media can also advocate for positive behaviors, like environmental consciousness and healthy eating, by presenting characters that embody these ideals.In addition, films and television can sway our buying habits and consumer behaviors. Through product placements and advertisements woven into the storyline, viewers can develop a desire for specific products or brands, which often leads to increased consumerism. For example, the success of the ""Mission: Impossible"" franchise has been associated with a rise in sales of gadgets and apparel featured in the series.In summary, the effect of television and movies on individual behavior is a nuanced and far-reaching issue. Through emotional connections, depictions of aspirational behaviors, and strategic marketing, media can significantly influence our attitudes, values, and actions. As media consumers, it's crucial to recognize these influences and critically assess the messages and values being presented. By doing so, we can maximize the positive aspects of media as sources of inspiration and education while reducing their potential negative effects."
237;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people like to visit museums when they travel to new places, other people don't like to visit museums. I personaly tend to visit museums when I'm in a new place because it's good for me know about the culture, tradition and history of other places.The first reason why people are willing to visit museums when they travel to a new territory is that museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place, as I said back. And also taking the chance for making friends. Visit museums can bring you the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge to participate in conversations. And that kind of knowledge speaks very highly of you.However, other people visit museums are the most boring expirience of a trip. My cousin Pedro literaly hates to visit museums but he really enjoyed his visit to the famous London - Madame Tussaud museum, it was kind of art entertainment but also that visit helped him to understand the artist works, and in addition he started to respect and admire other types of arts that offers in other museums.In coclusion, the museums are a visual source to know the history, tradition and culture of any place in the world. I think it's fun and educational.;When exploring new destinations, many travelers find it common to visit museums. In my view, there are several compelling reasons for this. First and foremost, museums offer a unique chance to delve into the history and culture of the area. By examining exhibits and artifacts, visitors can gain invaluable insights into local customs, traditions, and lifestyles. For example, the Louvre Museum in Paris provides a glimpse into French art and history, while the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City presents an extensive collection of American and European artworks.Another significant reason for museum visits is the appreciation of artistic and architectural wonders. Museums frequently house iconic paintings, sculptures, and masterpieces celebrated around the globe. The Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy, is particularly renowned for its stunning collection of Renaissance art, featuring works by artists like Botticelli and Leonardo da Vinci. Visitors can admire the artistry and craftsmanship behind these pieces, which deepens their understanding and appreciation of art.Finally, museums create opportunities to engage with the local community and connect with like-minded individuals. Many museums offer guided tours, workshops, and interactive exhibits that encourage dialogue and learning among attendees. This social dimension of visiting museums allows individuals to bond with others who share similar passions, enhancing the overall experience. In summary, people visit museums to educate themselves about local culture, appreciate artistic masterpieces, and interact with the community. This makes museums an integral part of any travel itinerary, enriching their understanding and appreciation of the destinations they explore while creating lasting memories.
238;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: In a busy and crowded world, we should not expect people to be polite to others.;Once a celebrity said: A man's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues. Recently, the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners. They are being rude towards others. Due to this phenomenon, someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other. Obviously, I do not agree with such kind of altitudes, the explanations I explored would be stated as following.First of all, a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression. Through those impressions, a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible. For example, I worked in a new company, if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well, my new colleagues will accept me, even then I will be approved by the employers. In opposite situation if I am being rude, I can not get along well with each other. Finally, I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job.Secondly, people will get respect from politeness within each other. Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need. A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure. There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed, because from their behaviors, they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity.Finally, the society needs a civilized environment and orders. And a degree of social civilization depend on its people's qualities. In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings, our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners. Benefit from those effective measures, there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate.All in all, I suppose that people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world.;"I disagree with the notion that, in a hectic and bustling world, we should not anticipate politeness from others. While the rapid pace of modern life can indeed lead to stress and impatience, I contend that courtesy is crucial in such settings. Politeness extends beyond mere pleasantries; it embodies respect and consideration for those around us. In crowded environments, where we frequently encounter strangers, simple gestures of politeness—like saying ""excuse me"" or ""thank you”—can significantly enhance our interactions, making them more pleasant and harmonious.Moreover, exhibiting politeness can alleviate stress and tension during busy moments. Courteous exchanges can foster a sense of calm and civility, even amid chaos. For instance, a friendly conversation with a stranger on a crowded train or bus can transform an uncomfortable journey into a more enjoyable experience. Conversely, a lack of politeness can spark conflict and aggression, heightening the stress and anxiety associated with crowded surroundings.In summary, I firmly believe that politeness is vital in a fast-paced world. It is not a luxury we can afford to overlook; rather, it is a necessity that enriches our interactions. By practicing politeness, we contribute to a more positive and respectful environment, even in the most crowded and chaotic settings. As such, we should continue to expect and encourage politeness from others and strive to embody it ourselves, regardless of the situation."
239;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;There is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success. For that reason, some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives. However, some people think it isn't supposed to be that case. From my point of view, I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path.To start with, hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as, a shining weather, a delicious breakfast and etc. People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end. As a result, experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time.What's more, people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles. Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties, they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens. Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way.So, to sum it up, both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people's life path will be a priceless treasure to them. Remember if you are afraid of encountering difficulties, then you will be in the troubles all the time.;I wholeheartedly believe that many of the experiences in our lives that feel challenging at the moment ultimately become significant lessons for the future. Each difficult situation we face leaves a lasting imprint on our personal and professional development. These experiences provide us with invaluable insights that we can utilize in similar scenarios down the line, thereby sharpening our decision-making and problem-solving skills.Take, for example, the disappointment of failing a job interview. While it can be a tough experience, it also offers a chance to reflect on our strengths and weaknesses, allowing us to better prepare for future opportunities. Similarly, a painful breakup may leave us feeling emotionally exhausted, yet it teaches us essential lessons about self-love, respect, and the importance of establishing boundaries in relationships. Such insights are crucial as they help us navigate life's complexities with greater confidence and ease.Additionally, many accomplished individuals credit their achievements to the difficult experiences they've endured. Consider J.K. Rowling, the celebrated author of the Harry Potter series, who was a single mother relying on welfare when she first began writing. Her hardships and struggles inspired her to create a literary phenomenon that has captivated millions around the globe. This illustrates how challenging experiences can be transformed into powerful lessons that propel us toward our aspirations.In summary, the tough moments we endure often turn out to be invaluable lessons for the future. They provide us with the wisdom, resilience, and determination necessary to conquer obstacles and achieve our goals. By embracing these experiences and learning from them, we can profoundly change our lives and build a brighter, more promising future.
240;Life in a city is much better than life in the countryside;As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement that life in a city is much better than life in the countryside.Firstly, in the city there is much better education system. This means, that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places.In addition, I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside. There are not only more jobs, but they are also well-paid. Of course living in a city is more expensive, but incomes are higher too.Moreover, in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means, that the culture diversity is huge. Meeting and knowing new people's tradition is an unforgettable experience, which could influence on one's previous habits.Furthermore, the city has well-organised lines of transport. The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside, so the city provides better communication.However, in the countryside there are many places to rest, because of its location. Moreover, peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness.Taking all into account, I think that living in the city is much better nowadays, because of the opportunities it gives. Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle, which for me is without perspective. If I could decide I would chose living in the city for sure.;The discussion about whether city living is superior to rural life has persisted for years. Some individuals cherish the tranquility and charm of the countryside, while others contend that urban environments present more opportunities and benefits. Personally, I believe that living in a city is far more advantageous than residing in the countryside.To begin with, cities offer superior job prospects and higher earnings. Unlike rural locales, urban areas serve as centers for businesses, industries, and corporations, providing a plethora of career paths. Furthermore, cities boast well-established infrastructure, including transportation networks, healthcare facilities, and educational institutions, facilitating easy access to essential services. In contrast, rural regions often fall short on these basic needs, hindering residents from enjoying a comfortable lifestyle.Another notable benefit of urban living is the diversity and cultural vibrancy that it encompasses. Cities are rich tapestries of various cultures, ethnicities, and lifestyles, offering residents an extraordinary and thrilling experience. With an abundance of culinary delights, festivals, and entertainment options, urban environments are lively and engaging. Additionally, cities are hotspots for innovation and progress, housing numerous museums, art galleries, and theaters that provide endless avenues for personal development and enrichment.In summary, while the countryside has its own allure and benefits, urban life is undeniably more beneficial. The opportunities, amenities, and cultural experiences available in cities make them exceptional places to live, work, and flourish. With their energetic and fast-paced atmosphere, cities create the ideal environment for individuals to chase their aspirations, accomplish their objectives, and enjoy a satisfying life. Thus, for those who prioritize convenience, diversity, and opportunity, city living is the superior option.
241;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does.;With the development of the economy, people become more and more rich. They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness. While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people, I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us.Admittedly, job can bring us happiness. People can receive a sense of values and respected from job. If people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence. In addition, job can provide money to us. However, people should concern more about their living environment than job. First, for most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives. Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years. For example, Workers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day. These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work. Second, beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people. Without beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety. Nowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly. Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil. In order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests. In China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people. Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories, they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases.In conclusion, it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers.;The connection between job satisfaction, living environment, and overall happiness is intricate. While there are those who argue that living conditions heavily influence happiness, I strongly contend that one's job has a more significant effect on overall well-being.Primarily, a person's job constitutes a major part of their daily routine, consuming a considerable amount of their time and energy. A rewarding and stimulating job can instill a sense of purpose and fulfillment, which are key elements of happiness. Conversely, a monotonous or high-pressure job can lead to frustration and unhappiness, ultimately detracting from an individual's overall quality of life.In comparison, although the living environment certainly affects a person's mood and lifestyle, its influence may be less immediate and consistent than that of one’s job. For example, someone may reside in a lovely and comfortable home, but if they are dissatisfied with their job, their overall happiness can still suffer. Additionally, a good job can provide the financial resources necessary to enhance one's living situation, creating a beneficial cycle that fosters greater happiness.Moreover, studies indicate that people often acclimate to their living conditions over time, a process known as hedonic adaptation. As a result, the initial uplift in happiness from relocating to a new and appealing area often diminishes, prompting individuals to seek fulfillment from other avenues, like their employment.In summary, while both job satisfaction and living environment play important roles in shaping an individual's happiness, I believe that the impact of one's job is more profound. A fulfilling job offers a sense of purpose, financial stability, and opportunities for personal development, all of which are vital for attaining happiness. Therefore, prioritizing job satisfaction and engagement is crucial for leading a happy and fulfilling life.
242;Some people like to communicate by e-mail and voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer?;Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day. Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much. Voice mail, e-mail, telephone or just traditional way: face-to-face. However, I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating.Everyone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication. You can talk to others from thousands mile. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact. We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address. If the address is wrong, then you will know right away. Moreover, e-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click.In addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly. Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid. Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect. For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do. Therefore, e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out. She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed. I don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive.Last but not least, every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time. Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident. For example, when I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively. They may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say. Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation. E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive. On the whole, to compare to all ways of communication, I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use. Its convenience saves our time. Additionally, honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can't be missing for a persuasive expression.;The emergence of technology has transformed our communication landscape, providing numerous options to cater to varying preferences and needs. Some people lean toward asynchronous methods like email and voicemail, while others appreciate the immediacy of phone calls or face-to-face conversations. Personally, I gravitate toward in-person communication.In-person interactions offer a level of engagement that surpasses other forms of communication. They allow for the sharing of not only spoken words but also non-verbal signals like body language and facial expressions. These cues are essential for expressing emotions, as they add context and help mitigate misunderstandings that often arise in text or voice-only exchanges. Additionally, face-to-face conversations enable instant feedback and clarification, making them more effective and personalized.On the other hand, while email and voicemail provide the convenience of responding at one's own pace, they lack the immediacy and personal touch found in face-to-face communication. Although phone calls are quick, they still fall short of conveying the non-verbal cues that enhance in-person discussions, making them less interactive and engaging.Furthermore, face-to-face communication nurtures deeper, more meaningful relationships. The personal connection established through in-person interactions significantly enhances trust and understanding. Whether in social or professional contexts, the ability to interpret non-verbal signals and engage directly can greatly influence the outcomes of interactions, from closing business deals to resolving disputes.In summary, although various communication methods have their merits, face-to-face interaction is distinguished by its unique ability to blend verbal and non-verbal cues, immediacy, and personal engagement. For those who prioritize deep, meaningful, and effective communication, in-person communication is undoubtedly the preferred choice.
243;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"There are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost. Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium, it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences. However, from my point of view, television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other.To begin with, television shows make people forget what is really important. One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air. Thus, they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives. One of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show ""Infinete Challenges"". This is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other. That is, watching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us.Moreover, even when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television. Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone. Thus, it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness. To illustrate my point, it is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together. It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don't require any participation.In conclusion, I firmly believe that it is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward. It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close.";I have mixed feelings about the assertion that television has ruined communication among friends and family. While it is true that excessive TV viewing can diminish face-to-face interaction, it is not the only factor contributing to a breakdown in communication. In fact, television can also act as a catalyst for conversation and connection among loved ones.On one hand, it is clear that spending too much time watching TV can lead to fewer meaningful interactions. When family or friends gather around the television, they often become absorbed in what’s on the screen, neglecting to engage with one another. This focus can result in less profound and significant conversations, creating a sense of disconnection. For example, a family that routinely spends their evenings in front of the TV may find it difficult to come up with topics to discuss during meals or other social events.On the other hand, television has the potential to unite people and provide common ground for discussion. Popular TV shows and events—like sports programs or award shows—can create shared experiences that friends and family can bond over. Watching a favorite show together can spark conversations about plot developments, characters, and themes, which can enhance a sense of community and mutual interest. Moreover, TV can serve as a means for people to relax and unwind together, fostering a feeling of togetherness and comfort.In summary, while television can indeed impede communication among friends and family when consumed excessively, it is not the primary factor responsible for communication breakdowns. When enjoyed in moderation, TV can actually promote social interaction and create shared experiences that strengthen relationships. Ultimately, it is essential for individuals to find a balance between watching TV and engaging in meaningful conversations with their loved ones.
244;Some people like to communicate by e-mail or voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer and why?;Although many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face, personally I believe that communicating by e-mails or voice mails is better. There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay.Firstly, communicating by e-mail is easy. Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with. In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident.Secondly, you can write an e-mail at any time of the day. As for me, I work and study at the university and I don't have spare time during the day. I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems. I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail.Thirdly, when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself. For example, you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite. When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail.And finally, there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail. You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business.To sum up, I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible, but if this is an important and not urgent question I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail.;The rise of technology has transformed the landscape of communication, providing numerous options tailored to individual preferences. Some people appreciate the ease of email or voicemail, while others favor the immediacy of phone calls or in-person discussions. Personally, I strongly believe that face-to-face communication is the most effective and desirable way to interact.Engaging in person fosters a deeper and more meaningful connection with others. Non-verbal signals—such as body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice—communicate emotions and intentions far more clearly than any alternative. This facilitates a better understanding of the discussion, nurtures empathy, and strengthens relationships. Additionally, in-person exchanges promote active listening, ensuring that both participants are engaged and present.On the other hand, email and voicemail can often lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations because they lack essential non-verbal elements. Phone conversations, while allowing for immediate interaction, still miss the visual cues critical for effective communication. Furthermore, face-to-face interactions encourage spontaneity and adaptability, enabling a more dynamic and responsive dialogue.In summary, although technology has simplified long-distance communication, face-to-face interactions remain the most effective and preferred method. They foster deeper connections, nuanced understanding, and more engaging conversations. I believe that face-to-face communication is vital for building strong relationships, articulating complex ideas, and creating meaningful interactions. Ultimately, it represents the most human and natural way to connect, making it my preferred form of communication.
245;"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement ""haste makes waste"" use specific reasons and examples.";This saying is stating that every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one. In my opinion, this statement is completely true, for these few reasons:For one thing, making a quick decision means that it's not very thought out, and that it hasn't been checked from all its aspects. Consequently, making quick decisions leads to probable bad results. For example: if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative, or a plan B, he could end up being unemployed, because of his speedy decision.In addition, making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity. In another word, if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn't have missed out on the job opening in the same firm, but at a different position. Hence, he wouldn't have been unemployed.Not to mention, that hasty decisions, not only goes to waste, but also, could affect the entire life of the person. To put it differently, is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed, he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs, thus, his life had taken a turn to the worst.As can be seen from this, is that a hurried decision is almost never a good one. That's why one should always study his decision carefully and slowly, to ensure that the decision that the person is making is the best for him.;"The timeless saying ""haste makes waste"" implies that acting too quickly or without sufficient thought can lead to errors, inefficiencies, and ultimately, an ineffective use of resources. I fully support this idea, as it is reinforced by numerous examples and reasons.One key reason haste leads to waste is that it often results in careless mistakes. When people rush through tasks or decisions, they tend to overlook important details or dismiss potential issues. For example, a contractor eager to finish a building project might neglect safety measures, which could result in accidents or structural flaws that are expensive to fix. Likewise, a student who hastily takes an exam may misinterpret questions or fail to provide comprehensive answers, leading to lower grades.Another contributing factor is that hasty actions can result in inefficient resource use. Without taking the time to explore various options or refine their approach, individuals may miss out on better solutions. For instance, a company that swiftly launches a new product without proper market research might create something that fails to satisfy customer needs, wasting materials, labor, and marketing dollars in the process.Moreover, history is loaded with examples demonstrating the perils of haste. The sinking of the Titanic, the Challenger space shuttle tragedy, and the 2008 financial crisis all serve as reminders of the risks associated with acting too quickly. In these instances, stakeholders acted without fully considering warning signals or understanding the potential repercussions of their decisions.In summary, the phrase ""haste makes waste"" carries a significant truth that underscores the necessity of careful planning, thoughtful consideration, and patience. By taking the time to reflect on their choices and actions, individuals and organizations can avoid errors, use resources more wisely, and achieve superior results. As the old proverb wisely cautions, indeed, haste makes waste, and recognizing this warning is crucial for attaining success and efficiency."
246;Some people think that the automobile has improved modern life. Others think that the automobile has caused serious problems. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life. Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are. Generally speaking, I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life, for several reasons.Firstly, people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages. For example in relationships. Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle. From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city. I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away. Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today. Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship.In addition, cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home. Furthermore, they are more flexible. My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money. He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend. If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms.Finally, the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world. If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life. They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas. There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car. As a result, people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world.In conclusion, the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life. Travelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car.;The advent of the automobile has sparked extensive debate, with some individuals asserting that it has enhanced modern life, while others contend that it has led to significant issues. Personally, I believe that the automobile has profoundly influenced contemporary life in both positive and negative ways.On the positive side, automobiles have significantly boosted mobility and connectivity, allowing individuals to traverse long distances swiftly and effortlessly. This has created new opportunities for employment, education, and leisure, greatly enriching the quality of life for many. For instance, the ability to live in suburban areas while commuting to urban workplaces has alleviated housing pressures in cities and raised overall living standards.Conversely, the automobile has also generated serious challenges, particularly concerning environmental impact and traffic congestion. Vehicle emissions have considerably contributed to air pollution, posing severe health risks, including respiratory illnesses and other conditions. Additionally, the surge in vehicle numbers has resulted in traffic congestion, leading to wasted time and increased accident risks. Cities like Tokyo and New York exemplify this issue, with notorious traffic jams that frustrate daily commuters.In summary, while the automobile has undoubtedly enhanced modern life by providing greater mobility and connectivity, it has also brought forth significant challenges, such as environmental degradation and traffic congestion. To address these issues, it is essential for governments and individuals to collaborate on promoting sustainable transportation alternatives, including public transit, cycling, and walking, along with investing in cleaner energy solutions. By taking these steps, we can help balance the benefits of automobiles with the imperative to safeguard both the environment and public health.
247;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: It is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents job than to choose jobs that are very different from their parents jobs.;When choosing a job, one need to consider it thoroughly. Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents' job or not, different people may hold different opinions. As far as I am concerned, I think choosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career. First of all, as parents are involved in the same environment, they could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information. For example, my father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge. Whenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting. Because he has many experiences, I could save enormous time in finding solution. This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues. If I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now.Nevertheless, since parents have worked in tens of years, they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry. They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children. For instance, they know which company has better welfare or provides better education. Moreover, their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies. It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society. When others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process. Some may argue that as time is different, the condition of job market is completely different. Therefore, choosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision. I agree with this opinion to some extent, but when it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly. The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash, so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more.In considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents', I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry. I believe parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path.;The idea that children should pursue careers similar to those of their parents is a topic that sparks considerable debate. While some contend that following in familial footsteps offers a sense of stability and familiarity, I hold an opposing view. Opting for a profession distinct from their parents' can ultimately prove more advantageous for children.On one hand, a career closely aligned with that of their parents can give children a defined understanding of the profession and its demands. They might benefit from invaluable insights and mentorship from their parents, which can significantly aid them in navigating their chosen field. Additionally, this path can nurture a sense of tradition and continuity within the family.Conversely, I argue that pursuing a career different from their parents' can be more beneficial. This choice allows children to explore their own interests and passions, fostering independence and self-sufficiency. By venturing into new areas, they can uncover strengths and abilities they might not have realized they possessed. Moreover, this diversity can contribute to a more vibrant and dynamic workforce, as individuals with varied backgrounds and perspectives collaborate, sharing their unique skills and experiences.Additionally, in light of the constantly evolving job market and technological developments, it is crucial for children to be adaptable and receptive to new opportunities. By choosing career paths distinct from their parents', children can remain ahead of industry trends and be better prepared for the challenges of the modern job landscape. In summary, while there are certain advantages to following in parents' professional footsteps, I firmly believe that exploring different careers can lead to a more rewarding and prosperous future.
248;Do you agree or disagree: To make children do well at school, parents should limit the time that children spend on watching TV and movies.;In 19th century, television is one of an significant inventions and has become a indispensible appliance in every house. For its accessible and containing fancy programs, television attracts audiences from a wide range of age and background. Children, who are addicted to TV, causes broad argument about whether they should be limited in watching television in amount of time. As far as I am concerned, I agree with that children should be forbidden in watching television or movies excessively.First of all, children generally have weak self-control, and thus they lose their time easily. Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents. I, in my childhood, was just a typical case. Whenever I back to home from school, the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours. I could watch TV for hours, but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes. I could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing, but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook. I, therefore, did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying.Moreover, sometimes programs on TV are full of violence and sex which are harmful to children. Children are not mature enough to make a judgment of what is good or bad, therefore they are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity. Recently, more and more children smoke because they imitate actors' behaviors on TV or movies. What's even worse, according to some statistics, there are more and more children have violent tendency, and the reports attribute this to TV programs and movies. It is obvious that there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health. How can anyone expect children could do well at school if they have those abnormal behaviors?Admittedly, in concerning the social relationship with peers, some may support that children should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation. I agree with this viewpoint to some extent. However, it doesn't mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching. In considering whether the time children watching on TV or movies should be constrained, I hold a strongly positive point of view toward this issue. Because children are poor at time management, and are less mature to make a good judgment, they cannot be too serious to be taken care when watching TV and movies.;The discussion surrounding whether parents should restrict the amount of time children spend watching TV and movies to enhance their academic performance has generated significant debate. I wholeheartedly believe that limiting screen time is vital for children’s success in school.Excessive consumption of TV and movies can negatively impact a child's academic performance. When children devote too much time to screens, they often overlook their homework and reading, both of which are essential for their intellectual growth. Additionally, the passive act of watching television or films does not foster critical thinking or problem-solving abilities, skills that are crucial for academic achievement. Conversely, participating in physical activities, reading, and engaging in extracurricular pursuits can nurture these abilities and lead to improved academic outcomes.Furthermore, restricting screen time encourages children to develop effective study habits and a strong work ethic. Without the distractions of television and movies, children are more likely to concentrate on their studies, fostering discipline and a sense of responsibility. This focus can translate into better grades and a more positive attitude toward learning. Moreover, setting limits on screen time can protect children from the negative influences of violent or inappropriate content, which may adversely affect their behavior and overall well-being.In conclusion, I firmly believe that restricting children's screen time is crucial for their academic success. By doing so, parents can help their children cultivate effective study habits, enhance critical thinking skills, and build a strong work ethic, all of which are essential for academic excellence. Therefore, parents should actively monitor and limit their child's screen time to provide them with the best opportunities for success in school.
249;Should we pay professional athletes (entertainers) a high salary? (Do professional athletes deserve their high salary?)Ê;Professional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine. Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this. This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question-do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money? From my prospect, I believe that they do deserve this high payment.First of all, a worker's salary can properly reflect his/her competence and value on his/her career. Therefore, those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways. They are not paid for no reason. As we are now live in a competent world, we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment. It's all the same in every profession. That's why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields, namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods.Second, such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete's great performances. Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they've gone through and how much cost they've thrown into investing themselves. They shall reap within their high salaries. In other words, if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances, there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed. Some people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair. However, in my opinion, as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his/her dreams and careers, that would be fair. Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone, but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment.In conclusion, high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances. It is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment, giving us awesome performances to enjoy.;The discussion surrounding the justification of high salaries for professional athletes, often considered entertainers, has persisted for years. Proponents argue that these individuals generate substantial revenues for their teams, leagues, and sponsors through ticket sales, merchandise, and advertising. Their performances attract millions of viewers globally, resulting in considerable income from broadcasting rights alone. The market influences their salaries, allowing top athletes to demand impressive figures due to their exceptional talent and the significant financial contributions they make to their sports.Conversely, critics contend that the wages of professional athletes are excessively high, particularly when contrasted with the earnings of teachers, healthcare professionals, and other vital occupations that greatly impact society's welfare. It's challenging to rationalize why entertainers receive tens of millions of dollars each year while essential public servants struggle financially. Moreover, such high salaries may shift the focus from the sport itself to monetary concerns, potentially undermining the spirit of competition and fairness.Nonetheless, it's crucial to recognize that professional athletes typically have a brief career span, often lasting less than a decade at the elite level. Their opportunity to earn is limited, and they must leverage their market value while they can. Furthermore, the rigorous training, commitment, and inherent risk of injury associated with performing at such high levels require significant dedication and sacrifice, often developed over a lifetime.In summary, while the hefty salaries of professional athletes may raise eyebrows, particularly when compared to other professions, they are largely driven by market demand and the vast revenue they produce. This issue is multifaceted, shaped by career duration, personal risk, and the societal value assigned to entertainment. Instead of solely scrutinizing athletes’ pay, it may be more beneficial to pursue a fairer compensation system across various professions that accurately reflects the contributions made to society.
250;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People who canÕt accept othersÕ criticism canÕt succeed in group working.Ê;"In everyday life we encounter different people, and we receive different opinions about us or our works, no matter positive or negative. It might be easy to take praises but hard to accept criticism. Therefore, here goes the point that people who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working. Personally, I agree with this statement.First, the core of group working is ""consensus"". It's the idea that everyone’s opinion accounts. In group works, group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion, think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement. In this long process of discussion, there must be different opinions sparkling out. It doesn't work if one member solely insists on his/her idea and doesn't take other member's criticism because the work belongs to every member, not a personal show for specific one member. It's every member's duty to respect other's opinion.Second, taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone's opinion that is against you. Even if you are not working in a group, you still need to take others' criticism. Criticism definitely hurts because it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them. However, criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it. Those who don't even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved. In other words, if you can't take any criticism, not only will you fail in cooperating with other people, but also get defeated in personal works. As one Chinese idiom goes: ""The good medicine tastes bitter“. Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal.However, some people might ask: what if the criticism proves to be wrong? What if that I was at first right but the seemingly reasonable criticism led me to the wrong direction? Doesn't insistence also a good character? In my point of view, even if you are right, criticism is still helpful because in this case it not only is a fixer, but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work. Taking criticism doesn't necessary mean that you have to take it all. You should have your own judgments too! And it's kind of art to make the best use of criticism.In conclusion, criticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism. It's just like a picky mirror through which we can see the bad side of us and thus try to become more beautiful and confident.";I firmly believe that individuals who struggle to accept criticism are unlikely to thrive in collaborative work environments. Feedback—both given and received—is essential for reaching shared objectives. When team members resist accepting criticism, they create barriers to effective communication and impede the team's advancement.Embracing criticism is critical in group settings, as it enables team members to recognize and rectify mistakes, clarify misunderstandings, and enhance overall performance. Those who cannot handle criticism often react defensively, dismissively, or even with hostility, which can lead to conflict and negatively impact team morale. This behavior not only stifles personal development but also restricts the team's potential to harness diverse viewpoints and innovative ideas.Moreover, an inability to accept criticism can foster a lack of accountability and a hesitation to take risks. When individuals are closed off to feedback, they may shy away from trying new methods or suggesting creative solutions, fearing rejection or critique. This can lead to stagnation and hinder progress toward the team’s goals.In contrast, individuals who welcome and learn from criticism exhibit a growth mindset, adaptability, and a dedication to group success. They are more likely to engage in constructive conversations, cultivate strong relationships with teammates, and foster a positive, productive team environment. Ultimately, the ability to accept criticism is an essential skill for effective collaboration and a key factor in achieving success in team settings.
251;Should we require our young children (aged 5-10) to learn music and art in addition to math, science, history and language?;Every parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful. In order to achieve this, they start cultivating their children when they are very young. In addition to basic knowledge like language or science, music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents. In my opinion, I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them. First, it's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young. Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination. Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules. They are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched. Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances. Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination.Second, music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing. They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way. They are essential to our spiritual life. Therefore, even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure.However, some people might argue that parents shouldn't put so much stress on children, since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them. In my opinion, it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like. If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much. In a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills. In this way, it will not be such pressure on children. In conclusion, young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage. Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his/her life.;The education of children aged 5 to 10 is a vital and complex part of their overall development. While core subjects like math, science, history, and language lay the groundwork for learning, it begs the question of whether music and art should be essential components of their curriculum. I believe that integrating music and art into the educational experience of young children is not just advantageous, but crucial.Music and art offer distinct skills and perspectives that enhance traditional academic subjects. They promote creativity, self-expression, and imagination, enabling children to engage with and understand their surroundings in varied and original ways. Research indicates that participation in music and art can also boost cognitive abilities, such as memory, spatial-temporal skills, and language proficiency, thereby supporting students' learning in conventional subjects.Moreover, education in music and art significantly influences children’s emotional and social growth. These disciplines provide venues for expressing feelings, promoting empathy through diverse artistic expressions, and fostering confidence through performances and showcases. Collaborative projects in music and art encourage teamwork, communication, and mutual respect, all of which are essential life skills.Making music and art mandatory subjects also tackles the issues of accessibility and equality in education. Every child, regardless of their economic background, deserves the chance to explore their artistic and musical abilities. This can reveal hidden talents and promote a more comprehensive educational approach that nurtures all facets of a child’s intelligence and creativity.In summary, mandating music and art education alongside traditional subjects represents a progressive strategy for teaching young children. It fosters balanced growth in cognitive, emotional, and social skills, preparing them for a future that increasingly values creativity, innovation, and self-expression. By prioritizing music and art, we not only enhance the educational journey but also help shape well-rounded, imaginative, and socially skilled individuals.
252;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is explaining how that subject will help in their lives outside school.;There are many ways of teaching. Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching, while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing. In my opinion, I agree with the second idea that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school.First of all, by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject. Take chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class. While I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas. This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good. I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore.Second, by bridging the theories with daily life events, students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving. This will address students' interests because it's the assignment that needs real life participation. For example, in law class, students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them. When any one of the situations occurs, they can think independently and figure out how to react.In conclusion, using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students' attention and keep them eager on learning, not only because it reinforces students' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own.;I wholeheartedly concur with the idea that the most effective way for teachers to foster interest in a subject among students is by illustrating its relevance to their lives beyond the classroom. When students recognize the practical applications and significance of a subject, they are more inclined to engage with the material and feel motivated to learn. This method enriches their understanding of the subject's value and transforms the learning experience into something more meaningful and enjoyable.Many students often question the necessity of learning certain subjects, especially those that appear abstract or disconnected from their daily lives. By linking the curriculum to real-world situations, teachers can help students grasp the importance of what they are studying. For example, a math instructor might explain how mathematical principles play a crucial role in fields like finance, science, or engineering, thus making the subject more attractive to students contemplating careers in those areas.Furthermore, demonstrating the real-world applications of a subject can enhance students' problem-solving abilities and critical thinking skills. When students see how concepts apply in practical contexts, they become more interested in delving deeper into the material and applying their knowledge. This approach can significantly improve their understanding and retention of the subject matter. Ultimately, establishing a connection between academic content and real-life applications serves as a powerful catalyst for igniting students' interest and motivation. By doing this, teachers can encourage students to engage more actively in their learning, ultimately leading to a more successful and rewarding educational journey.
253;Governments should focus its budget more on environmental protection than on economic developments.;Environmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century. They are both important because they are vital to human's future and welfare. However, since the budget and the recourse are limited, governments must choose between these two issues. In my opinion, I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments. The following are reasons why. First, environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments. All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one. Without Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she's gone. Just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well. Second, the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues. Environmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems. Take global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together. The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator, since the rising sea water could drown them. Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth.Some people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside. They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away. However, the truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now. It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages.In conclusion, environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence. As mentioned in the second paragraph, how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy? Similarly, how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by, ironically, by ourselves?;As the global community faces the urgent challenges of climate change, pollution, and conservation, the way governments allocate their budgets has become increasingly vital. Although economic development is essential for a nation's growth and prosperity, I strongly advocate that environmental protection should take precedence over economic development. This perspective is based on several compelling reasons.To begin with, the repercussions of environmental degradation are profound and enduring, significantly affecting human health, biodiversity, and the economy itself. The costs associated with pollution, climate change, and the degradation of ecosystem services far surpass the immediate gains from economic growth. For example, air pollution contributes to millions of premature deaths globally, imposing a heavy burden on healthcare systems. By prioritizing investments in environmental protection, governments can avert these expenses and foster a healthier, more productive populace.Additionally, fostering environmental protection can actually catalyze economic growth and open up new avenues. Investments in renewable energy, sustainable infrastructure, and eco-tourism can create jobs, spark innovation, and attract foreign investment. A clean, healthy environment is also crucial for attracting businesses, talent, and tourists, all of which contribute to a nation's economic advancement.Lastly, the time to act on environmental protection is dwindling. Climate change, in particular, demands urgent, collective action to minimize its most severe effects. By placing a higher priority on environmental protection, governments can showcase their dedication to the welfare of their citizens, the planet, and generations yet to come. In summary, while economic development holds significance, governments should allocate a greater portion of their budgets to safeguarding the environment. This approach will not only secure a sustainable future but also stimulate economic growth, enhance public health, and improve overall quality of life. Ultimately, the decisions we make today will shape the destiny of our planet, and governments play a pivotal role in ensuring a healthier environment for tomorrow.
254;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not. Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen, the car use will decrease. While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. But as far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea, which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future. The following reasons will present my points.First of all, since the public transportation has improved, it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus. For example, I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars. So, with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own. Second, a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world. So, with the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not. For example, instead of driving each one's car, if we put forty people in a bus, it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city.Although, I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can't meet every place. Of course, it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places. However, no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet. It not only helps you to reduce the car use, but also good to your health. In this way, this won't be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared, the best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years.;I concur with the notion that, in two decades, we will see a decline in the number of cars on the road compared to today. This forecast is supported by several important factors, including heightened environmental awareness, advancements in alternative transportation options, and the rising costs associated with car ownership.To begin with, there is a global movement towards more sustainable and eco-friendly lifestyles. As concerns over climate change and air quality grow, many nations are enacting policies aimed at reducing vehicle usage. For example, cities like London and Singapore have implemented congestion charges to deter driving in dense urban areas. Although the rise of electric and hybrid vehicles marks progress, it may not sufficiently counterbalance the overwhelming number of cars currently in operation.Moreover, alternative transportation methods are becoming more accessible and efficient. Investments in public transit systems, including high-speed trains and improved bus services, are making them increasingly attractive options for commuters. The proliferation of bike-sharing initiatives and the focus on creating pedestrian-friendly urban environments are also anticipated to lessen dependence on personal vehicles.Finally, the financial burden of car ownership is becoming too steep for many people. With rising fuel prices, insurance costs, and maintenance expenses, an increasing number are choosing car-sharing services or ride-hailing applications over traditional ownership. This trend towards a shared economy is likely to persist, further reducing the number of cars on the road.In summary, given the increasing environmental concerns, progress in alternative transportation solutions, and the growing costs of car ownership, I believe we will see fewer cars on the road in twenty years than we do today. As urban areas continue to grow and prioritize sustainability, the demand for personal vehicles is expected to diminish, paving the way for a more efficient and environmentally-friendly transportation landscape.
255;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? ItÕs not necessary for university students to attend class as long as they can pass their examinations.;In university education, students are given much independence in the ways of learning. Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses, while some students don't feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams. These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations. In my opinion, I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is. First, in terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams. Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students. Professors not only have the knowledge, but also equip with experiences, knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements. Second, it's students' basic responsibility to attend class. Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves. Many professors grade their students with class attendances. In other words, class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances. Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn't show up in the classes.Some people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own. Why wasting time going to classes? Doesn't self-study more efficient? However, in my opinion, this is a rather immodest way of thinking. I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors. Besides, even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors, they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates. In conclusion, students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes. It's an essential learning process. Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning. The learning process itself, however, is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student.;"The belief that university students can succeed academically without attending classes, as long as they pass their exams, has ignited considerable debate. While some contend that class attendance is not essential for achieving academic success, I strongly disagree.Class attendance is a vital component of the university experience, offering a multitude of advantages that extend well beyond simply passing exams. Firstly, attending classes allows students to interact with their professors and fellow students, fostering discussions, debates, and the sharing of ideas. This interactive environment is instrumental in developing critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills—qualities that are crucial for future careers. Additionally, being present in class enables students to pose questions, clarify uncertainties, and receive immediate feedback—opportunities that self-study often lacks.Moreover, regular class attendance enhances students' motivation and focus. Those who consistently attend classes are more likely to keep pace with the coursework, meet assignment deadlines, and prepare adequately for exams. This proactive approach ultimately lowers stress and anxiety levels, leading to improved academic performance. Classes also grant access to essential resources—such as libraries, labs, and other facilities—that are key to academic success.Although some students may manage to pass their exams without attending classes, this method can result in a limited and superficial grasp of the subject matter. University education is not solely about exam success; it encompasses developing a deep understanding of the content, honing skills, and promoting personal growth. By attending classes, students can achieve a more thorough and nuanced comprehension of the material, which will benefit them in their future pursuits. In summary, attending classes is a critical aspect of the university experience, and it is essential for students to take advantage of this opportunity to maximize their education."
256;"When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success."" Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above?";What do you think when you see a beautiful building? And also when you see an airport? Do you think they have built by chance? Of course don't. Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google, Yahoo etc. created by chance. Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success, but to be frank I cannot agree with them. I would explore my primary reasons here. To begin with, famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people. Hard work make you a professional man/woman which are powerful in his or her job. I mean, when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success. For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal. Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty. But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me. It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me. Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me. He do a lot of exercise in football field every day, so it is not for which he is luckier than me.Moreover, we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful. I don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us. So, for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question. You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky. If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam. Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam.Finally, you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way. The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance. These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his/her work. Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works.In the end, I think any great success need great work not great luck, even though luck is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans.;"The quote ""When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success"" ignites a lively discussion. While there's no doubt that hard work is a fundamental part of achieving success, I take issue with the idea that luck plays no role at all.Firstly, hard work is undeniably crucial. Attributes like dedication, perseverance, and a robust work ethic are essential in reaching one’s goals. Numerous successful individuals—entrepreneurs, athletes, and artists—can vouch for the fact that their accomplishments stem from relentless effort and commitment. Thomas Edison's well-known saying, ""Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration,"" exemplifies the necessity of hard work in realizing success.Conversely, luck also contributes significantly to success. Factors such as being in the right place at the right time, encountering the right people, and having access to unique opportunities can often be linked to chance. Many successful figures have benefited from fortunate circumstances that aided their journeys, like inheriting a business, being born into affluence, or possessing innate talent. For instance, J.K. Rowling, the author of the Harry Potter series, has shared how luck influenced her career; her manuscript was accepted by a publisher after facing multiple rejections.In conclusion, although hard work is an essential part of success, it is unrealistic to completely overlook the influence of luck. The two are often interwoven, and it is frequently the combination of hard work and luck that leads to achievement. Thus, I disagree with the quote, as luck can indeed have a significant effect on the path to success."
257;Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than a teacher. Others think that it is better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.;Different people prefer different styles of learning. I think both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful. Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning. Another important point is that for practical subjects you have to have a teacher. On the other hand, sometimes I would rather learning on my own.A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier. Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available, I get discouraged after spending a lot of time. In this situation, I'll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her. And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won't get discouraged and confused.There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor. For example, if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming, you'll have to find a teacher. It's almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own. By the way, if you are going to learn some things by yourself, you may learn and understand them incorrectly! For example, from my own experiences, after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher, I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo, but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits, I was able to play properly.There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won't have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes. In today's world there are many great and useful sources available like books, electronic books, the internet and TV and satellite. I can utilize them as tutorials for many things. For instance, I can learn English or other languages by a lot of helpful books and many online websites. In sum, sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own. In my view, both can help and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages.;The ongoing debate over the effectiveness of self-study compared to teacher-guided learning has generated significant discussion. While some people argue that independent learning is more effective for them, I staunchly believe that having a teacher is more advantageous. Several points support this viewpoint.Firstly, a teacher offers personalized instruction and constructive feedback, which are essential for rectifying errors and enhancing comprehension. When studying independently, it's easy to overlook critical details or misinterpret complex ideas, which can result in misunderstandings and inadequate retention. Conversely, a teacher can pinpoint specific areas in which a student requires additional assistance, providing customized support to address those weaknesses.Secondly, a teacher establishes a structured and organized learning environment that keeps students motivated and focused. Self-directed learning demands a high degree of self-discipline and motivation, which can be challenging to sustain, particularly when confronted with difficult or tedious material. A teacher can simplify intricate subjects into manageable segments, making it easier for students to remain engaged and monitor their progress.Lastly, a teacher facilitates valuable opportunities for interaction and discussion, which are vital for achieving a deeper understanding and better retention of the material. Classroom discussions and debates enable students to exchange viewpoints, ask questions, and learn from one another, enriching their educational experience. In contrast, self-study can often be a solitary endeavor, lacking the social engagement and intellectual stimulation that a teacher can provide.In conclusion, while self-study has certain merits, I strongly contend that having a teacher is more beneficial for effective learning. The personalized guidance, structured learning environment, and opportunities for interaction and discussion offered by a teacher create a more engaging, motivating, and ultimately successful educational experience.
258;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Working at home with a computer and a phone is better than working at a companyÕs office using the same equipment.;Due to the convenience of current technology, people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them. People are no longer restricted in the office. This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it's better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company's office. In my opinion, I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office.First of all, while working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly. They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together. Think about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he/she can assemble his/her colleges right away and discuss. It's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone. For another example, if one’s computer or Internet has any breakdown, he/she can call the MIS staff to fix.Second, working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works. For example, people are easily distracted while working at home. It's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away. In addition, while people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing. Moreover, people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss.In conclusion, working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency. It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home.;The claim that working from home with a computer and phone is superior to working in an office setting has ignited considerable debate. While some contend that remote work provides enhanced flexibility and comfort, I hold a more nuanced perspective.On one side, telecommuting presents several advantages. For example, it removes the burden of daily commuting, which can be both time-consuming and tiring. Additionally, employees enjoy a comfortable, familiar setting that can enhance productivity. Thanks to technological advancements, remote work has become more manageable, enabling seamless communication with colleagues and supervisors through various digital tools.Conversely, working in an office offers its own set of benefits. In-person interactions can stimulate teamwork, creativity, and innovation. Furthermore, office environments often provide access to resources and equipment that might not be readily available at home. It's also important to maintain a clear distinction between work and personal life, which can be difficult to achieve when working remotely.In summary, while remote work does provide notable flexibility and comfort, it is not inherently superior to working in an office. Both options come with their unique strengths and weaknesses, and the optimal choice largely depends on individual preferences, job demands, and corporate culture. Ultimately, integrating the benefits of both remote and office environments could be the most effective strategy for enhancing productivity and employee well-being.
259;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In order to succeed, you should be more like others than be different from everyone else.;Achieving success is everybody's goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success. Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances, while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else. Which one is the promising way to succeed? In my opinion, I believe that once you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success.First, being positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others. As living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game. Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive. If you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you. Take myself for example, when I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently.Second, being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others. In other words, once you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you. Take the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example. The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors. It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers. It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value.In conclusion, being different and unique is the better way to achieve success. It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards success.;"The idea that ""to succeed, one should conform more than differentiate from others"" has ignited considerable discussion among people. While some may contend that adhering to societal norms is key to achieving success, I strongly oppose this viewpoint. Celebrating individuality and uniqueness is pivotal for attaining success across various areas of life.Being distinct allows individuals to shine and highlight their special talents, skills, and viewpoints. In a society where everyone is the same, innovation and advancement would be stifled. History has demonstrated that trailblazers who embraced their differences made profound impacts in their fields. For example, Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, transformed the technology industry through his unconventional approach to design and innovation.Furthermore, staying true to oneself and valuing one’s differences nurtures authenticity and creativity. When people are not bound by societal expectations, they are more inclined to take risks, challenge existing norms, and expand their limits. This process leads to personal development, self-discovery, and a richer understanding of one’s passions and strengths.On the other hand, attempting to mirror others often results in mediocrity and lack of fulfillment. By conforming to societal standards, individuals may compromise their values, interests, and dreams, leading to feelings of inauthenticity and dissatisfaction, which ultimately obstructs their journey to success.In summary, I am convinced that embracing our differences is essential for achieving success. By recognizing and valuing our unique traits, talents, and perspectives, we can contribute meaningfully, innovate, and develop as individuals. Instead of striving to fit in, we should aim to stand out and leave our mark on the world."
260;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Younger school children (aged five to ten) should be required to study art and music in addition to math, language, science and history.Ê;Undoubtedly, math, language, science and history are all extremely important subjects in student's education since these subjects provide students the basic understanding of the world. Therefore, some people assert that there is no need to learn other subjects for younger students. Nevertheless, the art and music, from my point of view, are also essential for younger student's future life because those subjects help students learn this planet from another perspective and they can release people from the enormous pressure nowadays. In this case, I would definitely agree that the art and music should be required to study.First of all, art and music would broaden student's horizon and therefore make them thoughtful. It is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border, and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures. Under this circumstance, learning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures. For instance, students are able to feel the greatest music masterpiece in Euopren as the symphony of destiny-Beethoven's most notable workpiece is played. In addition, studying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax. Obviously, with the improvement of life rhythm, people have currently suffered too much pressure from their studies or jobs, and these pressure are likely to destroy one person if he cannot find a way to emancipate himself. Art and music are, of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life. When enjoying one piece of brilliant paintings, such as the Mona Lisa, people would put all their pressure down on the ground and just think about what the most proficient and mysterious smile in this world stands for. At this moment, they would totally involve in the ocean of art and their stressful nervous would be relieved. Apparently, this sense towards art is built on the initial study on the art.Admittedly, the study of art and music is supposed to rely on younger student's own interest. The education of art and music would not work if students resist it. Thus, the school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student's interest of art without adding extra study pressure.In a nutshell, in the modern society, since understanding of the lengthen and depth of the world is important and meanwhile people have burdened excessive pressure, younger students' art and music education should not take the second place.;I wholeheartedly support the view that young schoolchildren, between the ages of five and ten, should be mandated to study art and music alongside core subjects like math, language, science, and history. While these foundational subjects are crucial for a child's educational growth, art and music are essential in nurturing creativity, self-expression, and emotional intelligence.Engagement in art and music can significantly enhance a child's cognitive and social development. Studies indicate that children involved in art and music programs often excel academically, show enhanced memory and spatial abilities, and display greater confidence and self-esteem. Additionally, education in these fields can cultivate vital life skills such as creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving.Incorporating art and music into the curriculum not only enriches the educational experience but also makes learning more interactive and enjoyable for young children. It offers a necessary respite from traditional classroom methods, giving students opportunities to express themselves and highlight their talents. Furthermore, these subjects can serve as innovative ways to teach other areas of study, creating a more dynamic and engaging learning environment.In summary, making art and music a compulsory part of education for younger students is crucial for their holistic development and well-being. It equips them to be more creative, confident, and versatile individuals, prepared with the competencies needed to thrive in an ever-evolving and competitive landscape. By integrating art and music into education, we can ensure a more well-rounded, comprehensive approach that sets the stage for lifelong learning and personal growth.
261;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The personal and work-related challenges that young people are facing are not different with their parents and grandparents faced when they were young.;While debating about generation issues, people always have different opinions. Some people believe that little things changed through generation, while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way. In my opinion, I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation.First, under globalization and industrial integration, the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging. The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world. In the past, focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage. However, as those industries expand and become internationalized, people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges. For example, now there are more chances to do business with people around the world, so besides one's own profession, language ability is essential as well. For another example, financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century, thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management. Second, this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation. The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them. In contrast, young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually. They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want. It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them. They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences. In conclusion, challenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation, whether in career or in self-identification. It is hard to judge which generation's problems are more difficult but it is no doubt that until the next generation, there will be whole new challenges waiting for the next youngsters.;I disagree with the assertion that the personal and professional challenges encountered by today’s youth are no different from those faced by their parents and grandparents in their younger days. While it’s accurate that certain difficulties, such as financial strain and relationship problems, are enduring and universal, I contend that the nature and complexity of these challenges have significantly evolved over time.In our fast-paced, technology-driven society, young people confront a unique array of challenges that previous generations did not experience. For example, the advent of social media has introduced new pressures regarding body image, self-presentation, and online behavior. Additionally, shifts in the job market, characterized by the gig economy and automation, have brought about uncertainties and insecurities regarding career stability and financial well-being.Moreover, the rapid pace of technological advancement requires today’s youth to be perpetually adaptable, acquiring new skills in areas like data analysis and digital literacy. This has led to a distinct form of stress and anxiety that differs from what earlier generations faced. Issues such as climate change, mental health awareness, and diversity and inclusion have also gained prominence, compelling young people to navigate complex socio-environmental challenges that may not have been as pronounced for their parents and grandparents.In summary, while there may be some similarities in challenges across generations, I believe the personal and work-related obstacles faced by young people today are unique and demand new skills, perspectives, and resilience. Acknowledging and addressing these specific challenges is vital for fostering the well-being and success of young individuals in our rapidly evolving world.
262;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject. Some people believe that having a broad knowledge can give you a higher chance to success, while others think that professional in a specific subject is the key to enroll a success. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. As far as I am concerned, having a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success. The following will present my points.First of all, when one knows different region's works, it will help one to get a friend much easier. For example, I worked in a large company, which has many different departments. I was in the Management Information System department. What we do every day is to solve the problem that our clients asked in the phone. While some of the problems are the Engineering department's part, I went there and discussed with the colleagues there, since I have studied some of the engineering courses. It is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department, which made me popular there, and much easier to get the help that I need.Second, when you want to translate your major, it is important to know some of the things about different fields. Take my cousin Jeff and his friend as an example. They majored in financing when they were in college. But, they decided to enroll in the art system after graduated. Thanks to Jeff's hard working during his leisure time, he learned a lot about the history of art. Things ended up that he joined in a great team, while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank.Although I agree with the idea that knowing different fields is important. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that if one can’t success one’s own major, what else things he can do in different filed. Of course, it may be true when talking about this topic. However, what if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed. In this way, it won’t be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether having the knowledge in different fields is better or not are carefully compared. The best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that a broad knowledge of different subjects is really important.;I concur with the idea that possessing a wide-ranging knowledge of various academic disciplines is preferable to focusing solely on one particular area. In our interconnected world, a diverse knowledge base is crucial for achieving success. Engaging with multiple subjects enables individuals to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the world and its intricacies. For instance, a student who explores both science and history can better appreciate how scientific advancements influence societal development.Furthermore, a broad academic background enhances critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving capabilities. Familiarity with various disciplines allows individuals to tackle challenges from multiple perspectives, making them more innovative and adaptable. For instance, someone with insight into both mathematics and philosophy can apply logical reasoning to tackle real-world issues, resulting in more effective solutions.Moreover, the job market increasingly seeks interdisciplinary candidates, and employers value individuals who can think beyond traditional boundaries. A broad knowledge base empowers people to explore diverse career paths and increases their competitiveness. For example, a graduate with a solid understanding of economics, politics, and sociology could thrive in areas like policy analysis, international development, or social entrepreneurship.In summary, while deep expertise in a single subject has its merits, a broad understanding of multiple academic fields is more advantageous in today’s dynamic and interconnected environment. It equips individuals with the ability to think critically, solve problems creatively, and access a wider variety of career opportunities. Therefore, I strongly believe that prioritizing a broad knowledge base is essential for success over specialization in a single discipline.
263;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are. In my opinion, one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things. The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks.There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things. For example, if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people, you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places. By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future. These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can’t be always found in books. I do believe that great success requires taking great risks. If you want to gain very high profits in investments, you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money. If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam, you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies. The more you take risks, the greater your successes will be. If you don’t take any risks, you will have an ordinary life with average successes. That’s why it is important to take risks.In sum, I believe that success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them.;"I wholeheartedly concur with the idea that successful individuals are those who embrace new experiences and take risks, rather than solely relying on their existing expertise. In our fast-moving and constantly evolving world, adaptability and a willingness to venture beyond familiar boundaries are crucial for achieving success. Engaging in new activities and taking calculated risks enables individuals to learn, innovate, and grow both personally and professionally.One key reason successful people pursue new ventures is that it nurtures creativity and innovation. Take, for example, Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple, whose readiness to take risks and explore novel approaches in technology and design resulted in transformative products like the iPhone and iPad, which changed the tech landscape. Similarly, entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk and Richard Branson have constructed their formidable businesses by consistently challenging limits and delving into unexplored domains.Furthermore, taking risks and exploring new opportunities cultivates resilience and hones problem-solving abilities. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the light bulb, famously remarked, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" His determination and openness to experimenting with different methods ultimately led to his success. This mindset is essential for overcoming challenges and achieving long-term aspirations.In summary, the willingness to try new things and embrace risks is a defining characteristic of successful individuals. It enables innovation, encourages learning from failures, and fosters growth in ways that remaining within comfort zones does not. By adopting this mindset, people can unlock their true potential and reach new heights of achievement."
264;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations. We should consider many factors and choose the best of them. I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons:We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job. This can be done in school. In school, we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them. If we study them hard, we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future. For example, if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer, he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job. As you can see, studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job.One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation. By relating well to people, we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication. Commuincation can bring many benefits. For example, if you need help with getting a job, by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well, you can achieve your goal. Or, if you are a salesman in a store or any other place, by relating well to your customers, you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers. So, relating well to people is also another important factor. In sum, though some people may disagree with me, as I explained my reasons and examples above, none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits.;I concur with the assertion that for future job success, the ability to connect with others is more significant than solely focusing on academic performance. Although achieving good grades is important, it is not the sole determinant of success in the workplace. Effective communication, relationship-building, and teamwork are crucial in virtually all professions.In currently fast-paced and interconnected business environments, the skill to relate well to others is essential for career progression. Employers seek individuals who thrive in collaborative settings, as they tend to foster a positive and productive work environment. For example, a salesperson able to establish rapport with clients and comprehend their needs is more likely to excel in sales and contribute to business growth. Similarly, a manager who inspires and empowers their team can enhance job satisfaction and promote productivity.Additionally, many roles necessitate problem-solving and conflict resolution, which involve collaboration with others to find solutions. An individual who can communicate and negotiate effectively is more likely to address challenges and fulfill objectives. Conversely, someone who achieves outstanding academic results but struggles with interpersonal connections may encounter difficulties in collaborating with teams or developing a robust professional network.In summary, while hard work in school is valuable, the ability to relate well to people plays a pivotal role in attaining success in future employment. Employers prioritize interpersonal skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving because they enable employees to work efficiently with others and achieve business outcomes. Consequently, it is vital for students to cultivate their interpersonal skills alongside their academic pursuits to thrive in their future careers.
265;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.;Advertising is becoming part of our modern society. They penetrate into people's life, affecting people's choices in different things. Therefore, it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people's life. Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits, while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people's judgments. In my opinion, the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.First of all, advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit. The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people's concept of wholesome diets and self-control. It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting, regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body. However, advertising is not the only information source for people. People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources, like news or magazines. As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits, they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations. It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors. Second, in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle, some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods. In other words, advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people. Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added. These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good. In these cases, the advertising industry bolsters people's awareness of having a healthy lifestyle. In conclusion, advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits. There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter. Besides, advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle. It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away. We will always be able to decide our own lifestyles.;"The assertion that advertising is the primary driver of unhealthy eating habits is a matter of ongoing discussion. While it certainly influences our dietary choices, I only partially agree with this claim. On one hand, advertising can significantly encourage unhealthy eating practices. Commercials for junk food, which include sugary snacks, fast food, and processed meals, often target children and young adults—groups that are particularly vulnerable to persuasive marketing techniques. Such advertisements can foster cravings for unhealthy foods, potentially resulting in overconsumption and the development of bad eating habits.In addition, food marketers frequently employ misleading labeling and deceptive promotional strategies to present their products as healthier options than they truly are. This can mislead consumers into believing they are making better food choices. For example, a sugary cereal might be advertised as ""whole grain"" or ""all-natural,"" creating an illusion of nutritional value, while in reality, these products often contain high levels of added sugars, salt, and unhealthy fats.Conversely, it's important to recognize that individual choices and various external factors—including socioeconomic background, education, and cultural influences—also play a crucial role in shaping eating habits. Individuals from low-income households may gravitate towards fast food and processed options due to cost and convenience. Additionally, a lack of nutritional knowledge and cooking skills can further contribute to poor dietary decisions. Consequently, while advertising significantly influences unhealthy eating patterns, it cannot be considered the sole factor. A well-rounded strategy that addresses several aspects, such as education, socioeconomic conditions, and personal choices, is essential for fostering healthier eating practices. In summary, while advertising is a notable contributor to unhealthy eating habits, it is not the only factor at play, necessitating a multifaceted approach to effectively address this issue."
266;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Nowdays there are different resources to entertain, educate and inform people. One of this resource is television; however television has some negative effects among some people. Therefore, I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Some People spend a lot of time watching television, others even eat watching television, and some others make of this media a priority.First of all, some people spend a lot of time watching television. Instead of spend time with family and friends, they like to seat on a chair for hours. I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on, he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours. Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work, but he only let her talk during commercials. So, she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email. Time with the family is gold, some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them.Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family. This is the time, when if they have children, they can share everything about school, a project and even concerns. Also, when there is a dinner with friends, some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them. When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking, this is not the reality in some cases.Finally, some people make the television a priority. I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night. Honestly, I was in shock! How she could say that to me?. As I have said, television is a great tool to learn, entertain and inform what is happening, but I agree that television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority, spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television.";I take issue with the claim that television has undermined communication between friends and family. While it is evident that excessive TV watching can reduce face-to-face interaction, it isn't the only factor contributing to the breakdown of communication among loved ones.In reality, television can be a valuable tool for fostering connection and conversation among friends and family. For example, many households come together to enjoy their favorite shows or sports events, which often leads to lively discussions and shared experiences. Additionally, the content of TV programs can generate topics for conversation, encouraging individuals to engage with one another and share their viewpoints.Television also has the potential to unite people around live events and specials, such as awards ceremonies or holiday programming. These occasions can cultivate a sense of community, as viewers connect over shared interests. With the advent of streaming services, people can even watch their favorite shows together remotely, creating opportunities for virtual gatherings and discussions.Moreover, it's essential to recognize that the dynamics of communication among friends and family are multifaceted, and cannot be attributed solely to television. Factors like busy lifestyles, the influence of social media, and geographical separation also play a significant role in diminishing communication. Ultimately, it is up to individuals to prioritize maintaining relationships with their loved ones, no matter their TV-watching habits. By striking a balance between screen time and other activities, and leveraging television as a means to enhance communication, friends and families can sustain and even enrich their connections.
267;Do you agree or disagree with the folowing statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support;University students can be divided into two groups, one group with less interest to study and the other which include hard working students. Usually the second group's members do not have enough time to do exercise. We all know doing exercise for at least 30 minutes form the basis of the healthy and happy life. But I don't think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities.First, in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports. For example, my roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory. When she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day. As you see, she is doing exercise without spending a cent. What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health.In addition, students choose their major based on their interests. The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students. Because their major in completely involved in physical activities. In contrast, for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories, because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field.Finally, spending money on social activities looks like wasting money. For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose. For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people. In conclusion, I do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students, but I think both sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories.;The assertion that sports and social activities hold equal importance to classes and libraries in universities and colleges, and should thus receive comparable financial backing, is a subject of ongoing debate among educators and administrators. Personally, I partially align with this viewpoint.On one side, classes and libraries form the backbone of educational institutions, equipping students with essential knowledge and skills pertinent to their fields. They are crucial for fostering academic growth and, as such, warrant a significant allocation of the budget. Conversely, sports and social activities are instrumental in promoting physical and mental health, enhancing teamwork, and developing social skills among students. These activities offer vital breaks from academic pressures, enabling students to recharge and maintain a healthy work-life balance.Additionally, participation in sports and social activities has been shown to positively influence students’ academic performance. Studies indicate that students engaged in extracurricular activities generally achieve higher GPAs, exhibit better attendance, and have higher graduation rates than those who do not participate. Furthermore, these activities help cultivate a sense of community and school spirit, leading to greater student involvement, retention, and overall satisfaction.While I am not in favor of equal financial distribution, I do believe that sports and social activities deserve a reasonable share of funding. An equitable allocation of resources—where academic programs are prioritized but sports and social initiatives are also recognized—can foster a well-rounded and nurturing educational environment. By offering avenues for holistic development, universities and colleges can graduate individuals who are not only academically competent but also physically, emotionally, and socially prepared for future challenges.
268;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. ;To agree or disagree the statement that as far as getting a successful job in the future concerned, good ability of relating to people is more crucial than studying hard in the univeirsity is a matter of balancing its pros and cons. However, if one coniders the issue carefully, he or she may agree the title statement as I do.First of all, friends is a treasure with respect to either our daylife or our career. Relating well to people can bring plenty of merits to future job. Having a good ability of relate to people means you have a number of friends in a variety of fields, imagine when you are in trouble, you have a lot of people who have good relationship with you, so you can ask for your friends to help you solve this problem as soon as possible, even an esy phone call, instend of a series of complex solutions.Futuermore, no matter who you are a top-level managers of a company or a low-level employee of that company, relating well to people is also a importent issue. If top-level managers want to make a project successful, have a good relationship with their subordinaries is the prerequisit for the managers' work complete successfully, managers should listen to their employees needs and complaints about this job, pay much patiant and care to them. Consequently, make a good relationship with them.On the other side, if a low-level employee desire to enhance his position, it's fairly important to have a good relationship with their boss, only if the employee is considered excellent in his boss's eyes, he will be more possible to enhance position.However, someone may maintain that good specify knowledge is more crucial for future job. Studying harder in school, getting a good resume and absorbing lots of working knowledge, which can make these graduates more competitive than other applicants in one certain job. But imagine it, a person who is good at working knowledge but has an poorly relate to people, and a person who has a good ability of relating to people but his working knowledge is less better than the former, which person do you want to be? I think majority of people would choose the former because it has more chance than the latter in terms of getting good jobs in the future.In my point of view, I do really prefer to improve my ability of relating people and make more friends rather than studying hard in school.;The assertion suggests that for future job success, interpersonal skills are more crucial than academic diligence. I resonate with this perspective. Although it’s true that academic knowledge is important, the capacity to effectively engage and communicate with others is indispensable for achieving professional accomplishments.In many career paths, teamwork and collaboration are essential. Employers tend to seek candidates who can work well with colleagues, engage productively with clients, and cultivate strong ties with stakeholders. An individual with exceptional people skills fosters a positive and efficient work atmosphere, which is vital for meeting organizational objectives. Furthermore, robust interpersonal abilities empower employees to resolve conflicts, deliver outstanding customer service, and negotiate adeptly, all of which are significant advantages to any company.Conversely, while diligent study is important for gaining knowledge and skills, it does not solely dictate future professional success. Numerous high-achieving students may find it challenging to apply their knowledge in practical situations or may struggle with collaboration. In contrast, individuals with strong interpersonal skills can often learn and adapt swiftly, even if their academic background is lacking. They can utilize their network and relationships to uncover new opportunities and maintain a competitive edge in their industry.In summary, while educational accomplishments are valuable, the ability to connect with others is a more pivotal aspect of future job success. As modern workplaces increasingly emphasize collaboration, communication, and teamwork, employers lean towards candidates who excel in these areas. Hence, students should prioritize cultivating their interpersonal skills alongside their academic learning.
269;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? As modern life becomes more complex, it is essential for young people to have the ability to plan and organize;With the fast rolling wheels of modern society, life becomes more complex and is not easy to handle than in the past. Therefore, it is essential for people, especially young ones, to possess the ability to plan and organize since it can improve the efficiency and reduce the crisis of our actions. Meanwhile, eliminating meaningless actions.First of all, great planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive. Take myself as an example, I used to be overwhelmed by the burden of preparing for the final exam, submitting my paper, and finishing my internship work at the end of each term. Yet, in this year, following the suggestion of my roommate, John, I make a to-do list to plan and organize perfectly everything I should get done in the final and hence take every tasks and trivials into control. This plan ability helps me a lot, making me climb to the top rank of the class while finishing everything else.Equally important, the capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions, which may ruin one's whole effort over a very long time. As we all know, the employees in every company have to create profit as much as they can for their supervisors and complete their assignments perfectly. If some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead, they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent. However, things have been changing all the time. For instance, the deadline of task is shifted to an earlier date for the change of company's schedule. In this case, those employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired. Every employee can not afford this kind of loss.Finally, some assert that the ability to plan and organize can be learned until obtaining a job. Thus, it is not need for young people to possess this ability. Nevertheless, this ability is also essential for young people since young people can overcome their bad habits and fulfill their goals more quickly with this ability. As searching information on the internet, young people are probably distracted by other attractions such as online games or social webs. At this circumstances, they would surf on the internet for hours and end up no where. It is obviously a huge waste of time. But if they make their plan in the first place, and then stick to their plans, they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination.In this complex society, we, young people, are encompassed with multiple tasks, so the ability to plan and organize is undoubtedly a powerful and sharp weapon that we must be armed with.;I wholeheartedly agree that as contemporary life grows increasingly intricate, it is crucial for young people to develop strong planning and organizational skills. In our fast-paced and ever-evolving environment, the pressures on young individuals are intensifying. The prevalence of technology, social media, and numerous distractions can easily overwhelm them and lead to a loss of focus. Thus, mastering the art of planning and organizing becomes essential for navigating the complexities of modern existence.Strong planning and organizational skills empower young people to prioritize tasks, manage their time effectively, and establish realistic goals. These abilities not only help them maintain focus and reduce stress but also boost their productivity. Additionally, being proficient in planning allows young individuals to make informed decisions, evaluate different options, and predict potential outcomes—a crucial skill set in both academic and professional contexts, where deadlines and projects are a regular occurrence.Moreover, the capacity to plan and organize is a vital life skill that transcends academic and career spheres. It aids young people in managing their personal lives, making prudent financial choices, and achieving a healthy work-life balance. In an era characterized by complexity and uncertainty, mastering these skills provides young individuals with a necessary advantage to stay ahead and reach their aspirations.In summary, as modern life continues to progress and become more convoluted, it is essential for young people to cultivate planning and organizational abilities. These skills will enable them to tackle life's challenges, make thoughtful decisions, and find success in both their personal and professional endeavors. By honing these competencies, young people will be better prepared to flourish in an increasingly complex and competitive landscape.
270;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Nowadays, it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities (options) as well. On the contrary to this popular belief, there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money. However, I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option.First and foremost, I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college. Also, they can help each other for learning materials better. However, if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems. Another significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points. In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study. Finally yet importantly, appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class’s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments. However, the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times. Through this way, they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study. On the basis of the points mentioned above, I convinced that communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials. Moreover, teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it. Also, attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success.;The ongoing debate over whether university students should be required to attend classes has persisted for years. While some argue in favor of mandatory attendance, I strongly believe that it should be left to the discretion of students. There are several compelling reasons for this viewpoint.Firstly, university students are adults capable of making their own choices. Allowing class attendance to be optional encourages them to take responsibility for their learning and manage their time effectively. This fosters the development of crucial life skills, such as prioritization, goal-setting, and self-motivation.Another important benefit of optional attendance is its ability to accommodate various learning styles and needs. Some students thrive with self-directed study and online resources, while others gain more from traditional classroom environments. By providing the choice of attendance, universities can better cater to diverse preferences and abilities, ultimately enhancing academic outcomes.Furthermore, enforcing mandatory attendance can be counterproductive for students juggling other commitments, such as part-time jobs, family obligations, or health challenges. Granting students the flexibility to decide whether to attend can promote a healthier balance between their academic and personal lives, thereby reducing stress.In summary, making class attendance optional offers a more effective and student-centered approach. It fosters autonomy, addresses differing learning needs, and encourages a balanced and productive academic experience. By allowing students to make their own choices regarding attendance, universities empower them to take ownership of their education and achieve their academic goals.
271;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Telephones and email have made communication between people less personal. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There are many advantage of these invention, telephones and email. Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier. I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication, telephones and email, made people less personal. I will give several reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, telephones and email help people, who live far away from other people, to connect each other. Unlike email, send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address. I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with. For example, right now, I am in the U.S. It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents, who live in my country. Consequently, I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want. Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents.Second, using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication. For instant, sometime when I argue with my friends, I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment. So, when I have a time to realize what had happened, I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion. Thus, these types of communications make me feel personal.Telephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love. Beside, I could express my personal thought through telephones and email. As a result, I believe that telephones and email do not make communication between people less personal.;The introduction of telephones and email has transformed how we communicate, sparking a discussion about the personal aspect of our interactions. In my view, I concur that these technologies have diminished the personal quality of communication. A key reason for this is the absence of nonverbal cues that are naturally present in face-to-face conversations. When we communicate through telephones or email, we miss vital signals such as body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice, which can result in misunderstandings.Additionally, digital communication tends to feel impersonal. Emails, in particular, often appear cold and lacking the warmth and empathy found in in-person discussions. The convenience and speed of digital interactions can also promote a lack of mindfulness and reflection in our conversations. We frequently send off quick emails or texts without fully considering their implications, which diminishes the depth and significance of our exchanges.For instance, think about the contrast between receiving a handwritten letter from a friend and a short text message. The handwritten letter offers a sense of care and effort, while the text message might feel rushed and detached. In summary, while telephones and email have made communication more accessible and efficient, I believe they have also led to a decrease in the personal touch within our interactions. As we continue to rely on digital methods of communication, it is crucial that we strive to preserve the personal connection that is essential for nurturing meaningful relationships.
272;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;I highly prefer living in a big city to living in countryside. The big cities have lots of advantages and facilities over the small towns. Where a person lives and grow up is very important to his future life, because the environment that a person grow up, build the personality and his/her culture.There are lots of social places in big cities like restaurants, museums, bars, sporting clubs, cinemas, theatre and etc. People in big cities have many options to enjoy their life and spend their times with their friends in social places in contrary to people living in small towns who have few choices and at most cases one bar or one cinema to socialize with their friends.In big cities educational facilities is quite better than small towns with more experienced and profession teachers. It’s undisputed that in this modern world education has a very important role in the human kind future life. Better education results better career and been well paid. So persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns. Also lots of companies placed in big cities and there are more job positions in there than small towns.But by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation, because distances in big cities often are too far to pass quickly. Every technology has it’s good and bad effects but I prefer having the technologies with their disadvantages to living like 16 century without any of modern facilities of technology. In addition to what mentioned, medical technologies is completely better in big cities and in my view this profit overcomes all the bad influences of technologies on human kind.In conclusion, in my view living in big cities is quite funnier and better and more exciting than living in small towns because of many more social places, technologies facilities, better education and medical services.;When it comes to selecting a place to call home, two primary options emerge: small towns and large cities. Some individuals cherish the peace and close-knit atmosphere of small towns, while others flourish in the vibrant activity of big cities. Personally, I lean towards residing in a large city.One of the key advantages of city living is the extensive range of opportunities available. For example, New York City, one of the most populous cities globally, serves as a center for career growth, entertainment, and cultural richness. The city boasts a multitude of multinational firms, startups, and organizations, creating a wealth of job prospects. Likewise, other major cities like Tokyo and London provide unmatched access to top-tier education, healthcare, and cultural experiences.On the other hand, while small towns offer peace and tranquility, they often fall short in providing the diversity and opportunities found in larger cities. A town like Mayberry, with its population under 10,000, may struggle with limited job prospects, fewer entertainment options, and restricted access to quality healthcare and education. However, it is important to recognize that small towns possess their own special appeal, characterized by strong community ties and a more relaxed pace of life.In my view, the advantages of living in a big city outweigh those of residing in a small town. The energy, diversity, and opportunities inherent in large cities make them well-suited for those who prioritize career development, cultural engagement, and personal growth. In summary, while small towns have their merits, I prefer the dynamic environment of a big city, where I can chase my ambitions, immerse myself in different cultures, and embrace the lively essence of urban living.
273;Some people like to do only what they already do well. Other people prefer to try new things and take risks. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;You may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren't good at the things. That may help you expand experiences, look for your personalities and find your new talents. This ideal, however, doesn't necessarily be accomplished. If not, you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things. So, I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at.Focusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal. Without doubt, the more time you spend on what you do well, the more likely to achieve something great you will be. For instance, Albert Einstein, one of the most competent physicians in history, devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity. Instead, he hardly cared about something else. It is said that, surprisingly, he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because, at least for him, using two different soups properly was quite annoying. As the example above indicates, you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well.If you keep doing what you already do well, you can be better good at it. When you're doing something well, you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it. Then, you will motivate yourself to do more. To give an example, I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school. Because I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably, I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems. As a result, I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems. Thus, by doing what you are good at, you will be better at it.In summary, doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better.;As human beings, we often find ourselves at a crossroads: should we stick with what we know and excel at, or should we step outside our comfort zones and explore new possibilities? While many choose the safer route of familiar activities, I wholeheartedly believe that embracing new experiences and taking risks is far more rewarding and advantageous.One key reason I advocate for trying new things is the potential for personal growth and development. By venturing beyond our comfort zones and tackling unfamiliar tasks, we challenge ourselves and uncover new strengths and skills. For instance, I had never played an instrument before, but when I took the leap and enrolled in a music class, I not only learned to play the guitar but also boosted my confidence in my ability to acquire new skills.Additionally, embarking on new experiences often leads to exciting opportunities. When we embrace risk, we open ourselves to new relationships, adventures, and insights. For example, while traveling to an unfamiliar country can be daunting, it offers the chance to immerse ourselves in a different culture, meet new people, and gain a fresh outlook on life.In summary, even though sticking to what we excel at may offer comfort and security, I firmly believe that stepping out of our comfort zones and taking risks is crucial for personal growth, enriching experiences, and self-discovery. By welcoming uncertainty and pushing ourselves, we can uncover new passions, hone new skills, and lead more gratifying lives. Therefore, I will continue to embrace new challenges and take risks in my own journey.
274;In order to become financially responsible adults, children should learn to manage their own money at a young age. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?;One of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility, specially in financially matters. Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility? many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood. I am a kind of person who believes to children should learn to manage their own money at a young age, due to reasons that I stated below.The first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life, even though when we are not borne. So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues. To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood, when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked. First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished. I asked my father for extra money, but he refuse to give it to me. I found that I should manage the way that I spend money. From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted.Another aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family. If parents get the children all they wanted, they would be run out of their money for their essential needs. Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money, when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity. As a case in point, I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family, his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood. He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money. His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life, but unfortunately it was useless. Finally one night, having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car, he crashed a truck and died. Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property, but also bring sorry to his family.Although some people argue that children should be free to spend money to they what they want, In my opinion it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons, because our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood.;I firmly believe that children should learn to manage their own money from an early age to cultivate financial responsibility as adults. Developing financial literacy early is vital for establishing healthy money habits and fostering a sense of accountability. When kids are taught how to handle their finances, they acquire essential skills in budgeting, saving, and making informed spending choices.Learning about money management during childhood provides an opportunity to make mistakes and learn valuable lessons in a low-risk setting. For example, if a child makes an unwise purchase with their allowance, they can gain insight from the experience without facing severe financial repercussions. This hands-on approach enhances their confidence and decision-making skills regarding finances.Furthermore, teaching children about money management encourages independence and self-sufficiency. As they mature, they will be better prepared to deal with more intricate financial tasks, such as paying bills, handling debt, and investing wisely. By introducing financial concepts at an early age, parents and educators can set the groundwork for a lifetime of financial security and stability.In summary, equipping children with money management skills early on is crucial for developing financially responsible adults. By teaching the fundamentals of personal finance and giving them opportunities to practice managing money, we empower them to make sound financial decisions and prepare them for long-term success. Therefore, we must prioritize financial education and furnish children with the necessary tools and knowledge to navigate the challenges of the financial landscape. This way, we can cultivate a generation of financially knowledgeable and responsible individuals.
275;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Dancing plays an important role in a culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;In every country, people do dance for fun, for entertrain, and for decrease a stress. Dancing is also one of important parts of culture that represent to something that people believe. Many cultures do dance to show a great prosperous of its culture. And also dancing to entertain people. I will give reasons to support my opinion.First, dancing are significant part of culture that could show to something that people believe. For example, some culture people believe that they dance in order to sacrifice to their god so they will be get a happy life. Or some part of the world that are in arid area believe that if they danced, the rain would come. Consequently, dancing are the part of people belief.Secondly, dancing can represent to civilization of that culture. For instance, I have seen many western movies that when a kingdom have visitor from another kingdom, king or queen would dance to show a splendid of their kingdom culture. The way of movement, the way that they costume and also a music while they dance. All this is a civilization of their culture.Thirdly, many culture, people have many ways to entertain themselves. And dancing is one of that ways. Both people who see and dance also have a good time. For example, many event, such as christmas, last christmas I went to mall to buy gifts, and I was entertained by group of people in santa custom dancing in christmas song. I felt that people around me happy and group of santas also happy to see people happy.In conclusion, I strongly agree with notion that dancing is an important part of culture because dancing are represent to believe of people. Besides, dancing could show how civilization of that culture is. Moreover, people use dancing to entertain themselves. So dancing is important in every culture.;"I wholeheartedly believe that dance holds a crucial place in any culture. Throughout history, it has been a fundamental form of human expression and identity, transcending simple entertainment. Dance functions as a method of storytelling, cultural preservation, and community engagement.Take, for example, the traditional Japanese Kabuki dance, which is a highly stylized art form that communicates tales of myth, legend, and history. Similarly, Bharatanatyam, an Indian classical dance, serves as a sacred performance that expresses emotions and narratives rooted in ancient Hindu scriptures. These instances demonstrate how dance effectively transmits cultural heritage, myths, and values across generations.Moreover, dancing frequently brings individuals together, fostering a sense of community and social connection. The Samba in Brazil, for instance, is a lively celebration that unites people during the annual Carnival, showcasing joy and community spirit. In many African cultures, dance plays a significant role in marking key life events such as weddings, births, and coming-of-age ceremonies, emphasizing its importance in reinforcing social bonds and cultural traditions.Additionally, dance has the ability to evoke emotions, challenge societal norms, and encourage cultural exchange. The influential American choreographer Martha Graham exemplifies the profound impact of dance on contemporary society; her innovative works defied traditional constraints and inspired future generations of dancers.In summary, dance undoubtedly occupies a vital role within a culture, acting as a vehicle for cultural preservation, community development, and emotional expression. Its importance is reflected in the diverse array of traditional and modern dance forms worldwide, each infused with distinct cultural values, stories, and histories. As a universal language, dance possesses the remarkable ability to bring together people from various backgrounds, solidifying its status as an essential aspect of human expression and identity."
276;Do you agree or disagree with following statement? It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.;There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not. Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students, I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives. In the following, I will state my reasons for this choice.First, when students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations. As a case in point, more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts. As a result, they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better. Second, it would improve students' social behavior. If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well. They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well. Thus, if they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life. Moreover, these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts. As a matter of fact, when a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently. In my viewpoint, concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life. It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position. All in all, I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons. Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc.;I believe strongly that grasping ideas and concepts is more vital for students than merely learning facts. While factual knowledge is important, comprehension of core ideas and concepts is essential for a deeper understanding and application of knowledge. Facts are simply bits of information that can easily be forgotten or searched for, but ideas and concepts create a foundation for critical thinking and problem-solving.When students concentrate exclusively on rote memorization, they often miss out on the opportunity to analyze, synthesize, and evaluate information effectively. In contrast, by understanding ideas and concepts, students can connect disparate pieces of information, recognize patterns, and think creatively, leading to a richer and more sophisticated grasp of their subject matter.Furthermore, a solid understanding of ideas and concepts equips students for a rapidly changing world where new information and technologies continually arise. By mastering the underlying principles, students are better positioned to adapt to new circumstances and apply their knowledge in innovative manners. Conversely, an emphasis on memorizing facts can encourage a narrow and rigid approach to learning, impeding students' ability to think critically and tackle new challenges.In summary, although learning facts has its place, prioritizing the understanding of ideas and concepts is far more critical for students. This method of learning cultivates deeper comprehension, critical thinking, and creativity—all of which are vital skills for success in the 21st century. By focusing on the understanding of ideas and concepts, educators can help students develop a lasting appreciation for knowledge and equip them with the agility needed to navigate an increasingly complex and dynamic world.
277;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;There are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes. It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities. Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges, I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students' lives. In the following, I will state my reason for this choice.First, besides the good body shape, sports have very vital effects on human's healthfulness. In my viewpoint, our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly. As a case in point, last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back. After that exam, I felt depressed and exhausted. Therefore, I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well! As a result, sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health.Second, besides the academic knowledge, the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human's life. As a practical epitome, students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation. Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other's mind and different environment. In my opinion, social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment. So, social activities have same rights to receive monetary support.Moreover, they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments. If we follow just one wing of my life i.e., studying as a student, after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn't have any motivation. Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends. In my perspective, more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me.All in all, I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above-mentioned reasons. They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way.;I support the notion that sports and social activities at universities and colleges are equally as important as academic classes and libraries, and they should receive comparable financial backing. Although academic achievement is the central focus of higher education, the advantages of engaging in sports and social events should not be overlooked.To begin with, participation in sports and social activities equips students with vital life skills, including teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. These skills are crucial in the professional sphere and can give graduates a significant advantage in their careers. Additionally, involvement in these activities helps students cultivate essential traits such as discipline, resilience, and effective time management, which are fundamental to achieving academic success.Furthermore, sports and social activities significantly contribute to students' mental health and overall well-being. University life can be quite stressful, and extracurricular activities offer a valuable opportunity for students to unwind, connect with peers, and rejuvenate. For example, many universities have observed marked decreases in stress and anxiety levels among students who engage in sports and social events.Lastly, providing equal financial support for sports and social activities can positively influence student recruitment and retention. Institutions that present a diverse array of extracurricular options tend to be more appealing to prospective students, and those who participate in these activities are generally more likely to remain enrolled and engaged. A study by the National Collegiate Athletic Association, for instance, revealed that student-athletes exhibit higher graduation rates and greater satisfaction with their university experience compared to their non-athlete counterparts.In summary, sports and social activities are integral to the university experience, offering students vital life skills, enhancing well-being, and enriching the overall educational journey. Therefore, I strongly advocate for them to receive the same level of financial support as academic classes and libraries.
278;Some people say that the internet provides people with a lot of valuable information. Others think access to so much information creates problems. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In the modern society, internet is considered as one of the most important inventions over the past century. Some people believe that several problems occur from an information on the internet. However, some say that the internet provides a lot of valuable information. In my opinion, I agree with the latter because the internet gives daily necessary information, people can gain knowledge and they can explore the world.First of all, everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives. Sometimes, they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people. For example, a businessman who has no time to watch a television or read a newspaper can receive news and check stock markets easily via the internet.In addition, people can gain more knowledge by using the internet, the most useful technology in the world. Many people such as students can take online courses to study at home or they can watch beneficial videos which also teach them knowledge. Not only students but also everyone could get more information and knowledge. For instance, people who have problems with their health can search for more information about it.Last but not least, The internet makes the world becomes smaller which is a good thing. This is because people who have no time or have financial problems could travel around the world by using the internet. They can see lots of picture and videos of many interesting places. Moreover, people can learn other countries's culture and tradition which makes them have more knowledge about that nations.To conclude, people are satisfied with the internet and sometimes even thanks it because it helps us in studying, doing business and exploring the world. With valuable information it provides, people can enjoy their lives much more.;The rise of the internet has transformed how we obtain information, generating differing opinions on whether this change has been advantageous or harmful. While some contend that the internet offers an abundance of valuable knowledge, I align with the perspective that such extensive access can lead to significant challenges.On one side, the internet enables individuals to tap into a vast range of information from virtually anywhere in the world. This is particularly advantageous for students and researchers, who can easily find academic journals, articles, and books. However, on the flip side, the overwhelming amount of information can be daunting, complicating the task of determining what is credible and trustworthy. This environment has facilitated the rise of misinformation and fake news, with potentially serious repercussions.Additionally, the effortless access to information has fostered a culture of instant gratification, where individuals anticipate quick answers to complex questions with minimal effort. This often leads to a decline in critical thinking and thorough analysis, as many people rely on search engines for rapid solutions instead of investing time in understanding the fundamental issues. For instance, a student conducting research might opt to copy and paste information from a website without truly engaging with or comprehending the content.In summary, although the internet does offer a significant amount of meaningful information, I am convinced that the challenges stemming from such vast access outweigh its advantages. The proliferation of misinformation, the decline in critical thinking, and the emergence of a culture of instant gratification are pressing issues that warrant attention. Therefore, it is crucial for us to learn how to navigate the internet thoughtfully and to assess the information we encounter with a critical eye.
279;Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Others universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life. Some universities require students to study in one subject. On the contrary, others require students to study in several subjects. In my point of view, studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in, they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future.First of all, when students finished their high schools, they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities. This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all. For example, pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music. Therefore, requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them.In addition, people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one. Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study. For instance, university students who study business are also know history of the world. Furthermore, students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers. Hence, they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another.Finally, students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career. This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer. For example, students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include. Moreover, bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge.In concluding, learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject because it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future.;The ongoing debate about whether universities should mandate students to take a diverse range of classes or allow them to specialize in a singular field has sparked considerable discussion. In my view, pursuing a broad-based education that encompasses multiple subjects is more advantageous than concentrating on just one area of study. This comprehensive approach offers numerous benefits, such as cultivating well-rounded individuals, expanding career opportunities, and encouraging interdisciplinary learning.Firstly, engaging with a variety of subjects enables students to uncover their interests and strengths, which might not be obvious at first. For example, a student who initially believes they want to pursue engineering could discover a newfound passion for languages or psychology through an introductory course. By encouraging students to explore different disciplines, universities can assist them in making informed choices regarding their academic and professional futures.Secondly, a broad education equips students for a world that is increasingly complex and interconnected. Employers are often on the lookout for graduates who possess the ability to think critically, communicate effectively, and collaborate across various fields. For instance, a business graduate with a background in environmental science can devise sustainable business strategies, while a computer science student who has studied sociology can create software that is more user-friendly and socially responsible.On the other hand, focusing exclusively on one subject may lead to a limited perspective, potentially leaving students unprepared for the adaptability required in a constantly changing environment. In summary, universities that require students to engage with a wide range of subjects offer a more holistic education, equipping them better for the fast-evolving job market and the complexities of modern life. By exposing students to diverse disciplines, universities can nurture creative problem-solvers, critical thinkers, and innovative leaders who are poised to tackle the challenges of the 21st century.
280;Some people think governments should spend as much money as possible exploring outer space (for example, traveling to the Moon and to other planets). Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Although developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting, there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation. Thus, these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity. Therefore, in my opinion, I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first.First, as you can see that after great economic recession, many people in many countries were unemployed. Then, many people did not have money. When people did not have money, They had to rob other people. There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities. Consequently, quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy. So that, government should invest to create more jobs. When people have jobs, they did not have to steal money. Therefore, criminal rate were drop. Thus, people have a good quality life.Second, environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it. Nowaday, industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide, which caused of greenhouse effect. Greenhouse effect causes of climate change. These impact on every living creature in the world. So, government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide. In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide, government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy. If we lived in good environment, our life would be better.Lastly, family is a root of society. If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other, that family could have problems, If family had problems, it mean society could have problems. When society had problems, it could impact to a nation. Thus, government should create campaign to fill love to family. For example, setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other. When family understand each other, it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble.In conclusion, I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs. The basic needs: jobs, good environment, and love in family. These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people.;"The ongoing debate about whether governments should prioritize space exploration or focus on addressing essential needs on Earth has generated considerable discussion. Some advocate for the importance of outer space exploration for human progress; however, I strongly contend that governments ought to direct their resources toward fulfilling the basic needs of their citizens.First and foremost, critical issues such as poverty, hunger, and inadequate healthcare demand immediate attention and financial support. Millions worldwide are deprived of essential resources like clean water, food, and shelter. It is the duty of governments to ensure these foundational needs are met before embarking on costly space exploration initiatives. By investing in social welfare programs—such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure—governments can greatly enhance the quality of life for their people.Furthermore, the considerable financial investment required for space exploration could be better utilized in addressing the numerous challenges facing our planet. For example, the funds allocated for a single space mission could significantly contribute to building hospitals, schools, and providing assistance to underprivileged communities. Additionally, the technological advancements resulting from space research can also be used to tackle Earth-based issues, like developing more efficient renewable energy systems or enhancing agricultural productivity.In summary, although space exploration holds its own value, I assert that governments should prioritize meeting the fundamental needs of their citizens on Earth. This approach would foster a more equitable and sustainable society, establishing a stronger foundation for future scientific and technological progress, including space exploration."

Use specific details and examples in your answer. ;Nowadays, we are living in in the world which is absolutely complicated. Everything seem to be rush, and it have a lot of competition. These make people get stress. Thus, many people try to reduce their stress. There are many activities that could relieve those people who are in stress. in my opinion, reducing stress by listening to music, playing sports, and doing meditation are easy and practical ways.First of all, listening to music is a great way to relax. For example, when I go to office, I use public transport. I see many things such as traffic jam, crowded people at bus stop, and all so crowded people in buses. These make me stress. So that I always listen music from my mp3 player. I could enjoy listening music without thinking of people around me. Consequently, I feel happy when I listen music.Second, another way that is perfectly work for everyone to reduce the stress is exercise. For instance, I alway have many things in my mind such as a difficult of my work that I have to finish in time. These problem sometime make me hard to fall asleep because it make me stress. Thus, after work, I always do exercise, and jogging is my favorite sport. I feel that after working out, I am easily to fall asleep. Exercising not only reduce my stress but also make me get a good health.Third, meditation also one of the ways to reduce the stress. when I have many things to think about, and this make me stress, I will do meditation. Meditation is easy way to relax because it is not require any equipment, and it take few minutes. A way to do meditation is that I just sit down, close my eyes, and count my breath. These could relieve me from stress. In conclusion, there are many ways to reduce the stress. In my point of view, listening to music, exercising, and doing meditation are the most activities that people could do to escape from stress. It is are easy and usable. And everyone should find the time to do more and more to feel better physically and in everyone mind.;In today’s rapidly moving world, it’s crucial to find ways to alleviate the stress and challenges that come with modern life. While different individuals have their preferred methods for relaxation, I believe that the most effective strategies for stress relief are exercise, meditation, and time spent in nature.Engaging in physical activity is a powerful way to combat stress, as it triggers the release of endorphins—often referred to as “feel-good” hormones—that enhance our mood and energy. Activities like running, swimming, or practicing yoga can help clear our minds and divert our attention from worries. Many find that incorporating regular exercise into their lives enables them to better manage stress and anxiety, resulting in an improved overall quality of life.Meditation and mindfulness practices are another effective means of reducing stress. These techniques encourage us to focus on the present moment, release negative thoughts, and foster a sense of tranquility and clarity. Simply dedicating a few minutes each day to sit quietly, breathe deeply, and center oneself can be a powerful practice. For instance, apps like Headspace and Calm provide guided meditations that can help newcomers get started.Additionally, spending time outdoors is a fantastic way to relieve stress. Nature has been proven to have a soothing effect on both the mind and body, alleviating feelings of anxiety and depression. Activities such as gardening, taking a stroll in a park, or simply relaxing in a garden or on a balcony surrounded by plants can help individuals unwind and reconnect with the environment. Studies have shown that those who spend time in natural settings tend to have lower cortisol levels, the hormone linked to stress, compared to those who do not.In summary, managing stress effectively is vital in today's world, and there are several impactful approaches to achieve this. Exercise, meditation, and nature immersion stand out as some of the best methods, offering numerous benefits for both physical and mental well-being. By integrating these activities into our daily lives, we can better navigate stress and enjoy healthier, more fulfilling lives.
282;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn. Give specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Everyone is different. Although students are in the same process of education system, learning abilities in each students are not equal. Some students are fast learner, but some students are not. Thus, paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate, and it is not fair for teacher. So that, I disagree with this notion.To begin with, in schools, main task of teacher to give knowledge to students, and this role have to finish in time. there are certain period of time for teachers to teach. In these short time, it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class. Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule. If teachers pay attention to specific students, their work might not finish on time, and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know.Second, learning abilities in each students is different. It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time. Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not. Therefore, testing result are different. This problems depend on how hard study they do. It is not teachers fault. Thus, teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get.Lastly, there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get. That is problem in quality of education. Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics. Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary. This problem should not be happened. Therefore, grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher.In conclusion, I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class. Besides, learning abilities of student are different. Moreover, there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get.;I contend that linking teacher salaries to the extent of their students' learning is not a viable approach. Although this may appear to be a just and sensible method for assessing teacher effectiveness, the reality is far more intricate and fraught with potential issues.To begin with, basing teacher compensation on student performance would foster a competitive atmosphere among educators rather than encouraging cooperation. Teachers might prioritize students who are easier to teach over those who require additional support, potentially exacerbating the achievement gap between high-performing and struggling students.Furthermore, accurately and fairly measuring student learning is an immense challenge. Factors such as individual learning styles and abilities cannot be captured through standardized tests and assessments alone. Additionally, external influences—like socio-economic background, class size, and resource availability—play a significant role in student outcomes, complicating the assessment of a teacher's effectiveness.Lastly, this method could result in teachers focusing solely on test preparation, neglecting the broader objectives of education, which include fostering critical thinking, creativity, and emotional intelligence.In summary, while the goal of tying teacher pay to student learning outcomes may be to enhance educational quality, it oversimplifies a complex issue. A more comprehensive strategy that considers the myriad factors affecting student learning and teacher performance is essential for effectively evaluating educators.
283;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Movies and television programs should present stories in which good people are rewarded and bad people are punished.;When we watch movies or dramas, some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished. While there are also some people who do not like this. Personally, I prefer to see good people get rewarded. However, if the good people always get an happy ending, I don’t think it’s proper.First, if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring. If good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas. Then we will feel less interested in them. But if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story. For example, Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl. But now many people, including me, have been tired with it. I don’t want to see the same kind of ending again and again. So we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs.Even in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes. And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies. So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world. They will be misleading by those movies. And they may act like good people in order to get reward. Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person. But in fact, the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not. So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding.In fact, those good endings sometimes are helpful. Some people may be encouraged to do good things. But like I said, this kind of behavior won’t last long, because someday they will realize the truth. So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories. And if they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends.Based on my arguments above, I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing.;I have a nuanced perspective on the idea that films and television shows should feature narratives where virtuous characters are rewarded and wicked ones are punished. On one side, showcasing good individuals receiving their due rewards and bad ones facing consequences can positively influence society. It can help instill moral values and emphasize that traits like honesty, integrity, and perseverance are ultimately recognized. This message is especially impactful for children and young adults who are in the process of shaping their ethical beliefs.However, if stories exclusively revolve around this binary outcome, they risk presenting an unrealistic view of life. In reality, malevolent actions often go unchecked, and virtuous people do not always receive just treatment. Focusing solely on these outcomes can foster unrealistic expectations and lead to disillusionment in real life. Furthermore, such a narrow narrative scope may hinder storytelling depth, as many compelling tales delve into the complexities and ambiguities of human behavior.Moreover, a more intricate and authentic representation of life can serve as a powerful commentary on social issues and encourage meaningful discussions. For example, a film that depicts a flawed system where wrongdoers flourish can ignite conversations about the necessity for change. Therefore, while I support the idea of films and TV series promoting moral principles, I also believe they should seek to portray life in its entirety, including its imperfections and injustices, to deliver a more realistic and thought-provoking viewing experience.
284;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;There are many advantages of distance learning, but it should not replace classroom learning. Learning in classroom could provide more information to study. Besides, learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills, and learning how to solve problem in real situation. Consequently, I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt. Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example. For example, in biology class, learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits. Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog. Unlike classroom, online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation.Secondly, online class could not provide knowledge about social skills. For instance, In a classroom, teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group. This could help students to learn how to deal with people, how to collaborate with people in their group. This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes.Lastly, learning in classroom, student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body. Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way. If student do it by themselves, they might be hurt themselves. This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide. In conclusion, I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class. Because, classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject. Besides, classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill. Moreover, classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health. Thus, having classroom could provide abundant skills to students.;The emergence of technology has transformed the educational landscape, positioning distance learning and online computer classes as practical alternatives to traditional classroom settings. In recent years, the idea that these digital learning methods should take precedence over conventional in-person instruction has gained considerable momentum. While some may contend that the traditional classroom environment is crucial for effective learning, I strongly believe that distance learning and online classes can prove to be more efficient and effective.One of the key benefits of distance learning and online classes is the flexibility they offer. Students have the freedom to access course materials and engage with content at their own pace, unbound by the constraints of a physical classroom. This flexibility is especially advantageous for individuals balancing work or family obligations, as well as those residing in remote areas with limited educational access. Additionally, online programs can be adapted to cater to each student's unique needs, fostering a more personalized educational experience.Cost-effectiveness is another major advantage of distance learning and online classes. These programs typically require fewer physical resources and less infrastructure, making them a more affordable option for many students. Moreover, online education can reach a broader audience, minimizing the necessity for physical classrooms and reducing the environmental impact associated with commuting. Furthermore, online courses provide access to a wealth of educational resources, such as video lectures, interactive simulations, and online discussions, which can significantly enrich the learning process.It is worth mentioning that distance learning and online classes may not be ideal for everyone, especially those who need hands-on training or prefer face-to-face interaction. However, advancements in technology continue to enhance the quality and effectiveness of online courses. In conclusion, distance learning and online computer classes provide a flexible, cost-effective, and personalized approach to education, making them a viable alternative to traditional classroom learning. As technology continues to evolve, online learning is likely to grow in popularity and effectiveness as an educational method.
285;What are some of experiences that have shaped your outlook and the way you live now.;Many circumstances that I experienced change the way I think. There are many experiences that are improve my life in many way. For example, I could improve the way that I solve problems, improve how I take care of my health, and improve to plan my life for future. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems. For example, in math class, the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step. Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem. I could adapt this method to use my real life. When I want to go to somewhere, I try to find the way to reach to destination. Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time. I could find a better way to solve problems.Secondly, Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself. For instance, reading and listening the news about choosing a good diet are the way to keep myself are more healthy. Thus, I am always buy a quality food such as organic food. This food are not have chemical. So that, I can have a good health. This experience teach me to aware my health.Lastly, experiences are also change to plan for my future life. For example, I read about saving money for my retire is a good plan for my life. Consequently, I start changing myself from spending many thing that I want to saving money for my entire life. This experience change me to concern about making plan for my future life.In conclusion, experiences that shape my thinking and the way to live my life are teach me to be a better person. Because I could find a better way to solve problems. Besides, experiences could shape me to be more aware about my health. Moreover, these experiences could make me to make plan for my future life. These experiences taught me to change my life to be a better person.;Throughout my life, I have encountered numerous experiences that have profoundly influenced my perspective and lifestyle. One of the most pivotal moments was relocating to a new country during my teenage years. This transition compelled me to adjust to an unfamiliar culture, language, and environment, highlighting the importance of resilience and adaptability. As a result, I have become more open-minded and eager to embrace new challenges, fostering significant personal and professional growth.Another impactful experience has been my volunteering at a local community center. Observing the struggles faced by countless individuals and families deepened my appreciation for gratitude and empathy. This involvement has kindled a sense of social responsibility and compassion within me, prompting me to prioritize giving back to my community and assisting those in need.Moreover, my encounters with failure and setbacks have significantly influenced my perspective. Initially, I found it difficult to manage disappointment and self-doubt, but over time, I have recognized that failure is a vital component of the learning journey. This insight has fostered a growth mindset, allowing me to view challenges as opportunities for development and enhancement. Consequently, I have grown more confident and driven, with a refreshed sense of purpose and direction.In summary, these experiences have collectively shaped my perspective and lifestyle by imparting valuable lessons on adaptability, empathy, and resilience. They have helped me cultivate a positive and optimistic mindset, enabling me to face life’s challenges with increased ease and confidence. As I continue on this journey, I am thankful for these formative experiences and eager for the new lessons and opportunities that lie ahead.
286;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreigh language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Give the advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Knowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time. Many people pursue to study foreign language. There are two options to learn foreign language. First is stay in homeland to study foreign language. The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken. Going to another place to learn language is better choice. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language. For example, everyone around me speaks foreign language, and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people. If I could not communicate with other people, I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger. This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language.Secondly, having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster. For instance, English school in outside my home country, there are many people that come from different places and from different languages. The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language. Thus, I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong. This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster.In conclusion, I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people. Besides, in foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends. Learning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language.;The discussion around whether it is more beneficial to learn a foreign language in one’s home country or in the country where that language is spoken has been prevalent for quite some time. Each method has its own merits, and the most suitable choice often hinges on personal goals and circumstances. In this essay, I will explore the advantages of both approaches and contend that studying a foreign language in its native country is ultimately more effective.On one hand, learning a foreign language in one’s home country has distinct benefits. For starters, it tends to be more convenient and cost-efficient, as learners do not need to travel abroad or manage living expenses. Additionally, local language schools and tutors can offer structured lessons and resources, which can greatly aid beginners. Furthermore, students can progress at their own pace and easily access support and materials when necessary.Conversely, studying a foreign language in its country of origin provides unparalleled immersion and practice opportunities. Being surrounded by native speakers, engaging with cultural activities, and utilizing authentic materials significantly enhances language proficiency and the grasp of subtle nuances. Students can participate in real-world conversations, encounter various dialects, and improve their listening and speaking abilities more effectively. For instance, a student learning Spanish in Spain would have the chance to converse with locals, watch Spanish television shows, and read Spanish newspapers, all of which can expedite their learning journey.In summary, while there are advantages to studying a foreign language in one’s own country, I argue that immersing oneself in the culture where the language is spoken offers a more enriching and comprehensive experience. Engaging with native speakers, practicing language skills in everyday situations, and absorbing the local culture can lead to quicker advancement and improved fluency. Ultimately, the decision between these two methods relies on personal preferences and circumstances, but for those who have the means, learning a foreign language in its native environment is likely to be a more fulfilling experience.
287;If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place. However, it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements. In my hometown, there are almost complete public utilities for one’s needs but transportation. So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation. Since I’m facing the traffic congestion every day. And this problem seem to get worst. At first, it should have more alternatives to use public transportation, such as a subway train or a sky train. Hence, people will have more ways to go to a place. Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community, It makes people in this area have no choice. They must take only a bus to go to another place. If a subway and a sky train are available here, it will be more convenience to them. For example, people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule. On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus. Also, this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly. Secondly, the buses provide merely two routes in this community. It is absolutely a major problem. For example, if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses, I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus. Obviously, it is waste of time. They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily.Lastly, having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars. Also, it provides many advantages. For instance, people can save their expenses form gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive. The necessary energy will slowly be used up, since people use less their own cars.To sum up, the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people’s living. I wish one day this problem would be changed. And then, the transportation in my hometown is no longer difficult for everyone in this community.;If I could modify one significant aspect of my hometown, it would be to improve the public transportation system. My hometown is a small suburban area that has minimal options for transportation without a car, which can be challenging for residents who don't own vehicles or prefer not to drive. For example, many elderly members of our community struggle to reach essential services like grocery stores and healthcare facilities because they cannot drive themselves.Additionally, the lack of public transportation impacts the environment, as more people depend on personal vehicles, causing increased air pollution and traffic congestion. During peak hours, the primary roads in my town become overcrowded with cars, resulting in long delays and exacerbating the town's carbon footprint. Implementing a reliable and efficient public transit system, such as buses or trains, could dramatically decrease the number of cars on the road, leading to cleaner air and reduced traffic.Furthermore, a robust public transportation network would also benefit local businesses and stimulate the economy. With improved access to different parts of town, residents would be more inclined to shop and dine at local restaurants and stores, thereby supporting the local economy. For instance, introducing a bus route that connects the town center with nearby shopping areas would encourage residents to explore and frequent these locations, ultimately fostering the town's commercial growth. In summary, establishing a public transportation system would significantly improve residents' quality of life, support local businesses, and promote a more sustainable environment, making it the one key change I would implement in my hometown.
288;Schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Getting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance. Thereby, evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system. Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students. Therefore, I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers.To begin with, Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance. For example, evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product. Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information. Consequently, teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give. Therefore, evaluating from students could improve teachers' performance.Additionally, this evaluation from students could improve schools' quality. Teachers could augment their quality. Consequently, When school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality. For instance, in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high. Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students.Finally, people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students. Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance. Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects, students could comprehend their subject easily. As a result, students, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life.In conclusion, I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance. Moreover, schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers. Furthermore, students are easy to understand their subjects. Thus, I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers.;I wholeheartedly support the idea of schools encouraging students to assess their teachers. This practice offers numerous advantages, such as enhancing teacher effectiveness, enriching the student learning experience, and fostering accountability. By gathering insights from students, teachers can pinpoint specific areas in which they might improve, whether it be communication, clarity, or accessibility. For example, a teacher might realize they haven’t provided enough examples to clarify complex topics, prompting them to modify their teaching approach to better serve their students' needs.Additionally, student evaluations can assist schools in making informed choices regarding teacher professional development and support. When a teacher consistently receives low feedback from students, school administrators can offer tailored training or mentoring to facilitate their improvement. Conversely, those who earn high evaluations can act as exemplars of effective teaching, sharing their successful strategies with fellow educators. This not only elevates teacher morale but also cultivates a culture of ongoing improvement within the institution.Another key benefit of student evaluations is that they empower students to have a say in their education. By recognizing their views, schools show a dedication to student-centered learning and encourage learners to engage actively in their academic journeys. This engagement can enhance student motivation, satisfaction, and overall educational fulfillment. For instance, a student might propose a different instructional method or resource that they find more engaging, allowing the teacher to integrate that feedback into their lessons.In summary, encouraging students to evaluate their teachers is a straightforward yet impactful method for promoting educational excellence, student satisfaction, and institutional accountability. By harnessing student feedback, schools can cultivate a more supportive and effective learning environment that benefits both students and teachers. Thus, I firmly advocate for the implementation of student evaluations of teachers as a standard practice within educational institutions.
289;Some people prefer to work for a large company. Others prefer to work for a small company. Which would you prefer? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.;Companies vary from small to large ones based on the context, success and needs of their work. Small companies usually have a local job in the area, while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries. I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons.First, to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company. Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing, managing and selling their products in different countries. For example, if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country, they would need more employees in that country to work there. In other words, Large company equals more job opportunity.Second, I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one. The fact that a company is a large one, this means that it's having a considerable success. In other words, this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees. For instance, common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won't give the same salary as a small local company.Third, I love travelling around the world. large companies have an international reputation, as they organize international conferences, meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people. As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops.In conclusion, i can certainly state that I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one. I have different reasons to hold that, such as having a better chance to find work, having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences.;When it comes to selecting a workplace, people have varying preferences. Some individuals are drawn to large corporations, while others favor smaller firms. Personally, I lean towards working for a small company, and I have several reasons for this preference. To begin with, small companies foster a more personal and dynamic work atmosphere. With a limited number of employees, the environment tends to be more cohesive, allowing everyone to be familiar with one another’s names and roles. This enhances communication, collaboration, and teamwork. In a smaller setting, I can easily approach my supervisor or colleagues to share ideas or voice concerns, cultivating a strong sense of community and belonging.Additionally, small businesses frequently offer greater opportunities for growth and development. With fewer staff members, each individual often takes on more diverse responsibilities and wears multiple hats. This enables me to acquire a broad array of skills and experiences that can benefit my future career. In contrast, larger corporations often come with a rigid hierarchy, restricting employees to specific roles or departments.Finally, small companies are typically more nimble and responsive to changes in the marketplace. Without the burden of excessive bureaucracy, they can swiftly adapt to new trends and innovate, making the work environment more stimulating and challenging. In a smaller organization, I can directly observe how my contributions influence the company’s overall success, which instills a sense of purpose and motivation.In summary, my preference for working at a small company stems from its close-knit work culture, ample opportunities for personal growth, and agility in responding to change. These elements create a more engaging, collaborative, and dynamic workplace where I can flourish and play a meaningful role in the organization’s success.
290;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;No one can disagree that knowledge is the most important for everyone. College and university are playing in an important role to provide academic skills to people in order to pursue their goal. There are an issue that some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students however there are others people who think that everyone should have this chance to gain these advance skills from college or university. This issue will be discussed.First of all, many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students. The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money. College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time. They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students. Consequently, mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university.On the other hand, there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education. Of course, higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try. Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change. With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future. Thus, mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university.In conclusion, I personally agree with that college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal. Students can have opportunity to learn, to practice, to gain more knowledge for their career and for their future. Studying in college and university is a great opportunity that all students should have.;The ongoing discussion about the accessibility of higher education has ignited passionate debates among educators and policymakers. Some argue that college and university education should be open to all students, irrespective of their academic history or achievements. Conversely, others contend that higher education should be reserved for those who excel academically. I firmly believe that higher education should be accessible to every student. Education is a fundamental right that all individuals deserve, and limiting access based on academic performance is unjust. Every student has the capacity to learn and develop, and higher education offers them the chance to pursue their interests and hone their skills. Additionally, ensuring that higher education is available to everyone will cultivate a more educated and skilled workforce, which is vital for a nation's economic growth and advancement.Moreover, restricting higher education to only the most accomplished students would diminish diversity within academic settings. Students from various backgrounds and differing academic achievements contribute unique perspectives and experiences, enriching the learning environment for all. Additionally, higher education institutions provide support systems such as tutoring and academic advising to assist those who may be struggling.In summary, I strongly advocate for making higher education accessible to all students, regardless of their academic records. It is crucial for personal development, economic progress, and social mobility. By ensuring equal access to higher education, we can foster a more inclusive and equitable society where every individual has the chance to realize their full potential.
291;Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed to play it.Ê;It is a debatable subject that children should not be allowed to play computer games since playing computer games is a a waste of time. I hold a positive view against this opinion. First and foremost, a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined. An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week, while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days. Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games, because of their low control ability. Second, children could learn nothing from these computer games, therefore time on this activity is really time wasting. Since all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children, majority of the games use war, violence, bloody, or sexual subjects to lure the students. However, those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths. Admittedly, there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career. But we have to realize the fact: majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying, sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games. It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar, and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar. In conclusion, I believe it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games. The computer games are like cigerate to adults and we need to set up rules to regulate this area.;The discussion surrounding the allowance of computer games for students has been a divisive topic for many years. While some contend that gaming offers cognitive and social advantages, I strongly maintain that it is a frivolous activity that should not be permitted.To begin with, computer games can serve as a major diversion from educational obligations. Students who invest excessive time into gaming often bypass essential tasks such as homework and studying, resulting in declining grades and a poor grasp of fundamental concepts. Additionally, the hours spent gaming could be more effectively spent on reading, acquiring new skills, or participating in physical activities that enhance overall health.Moreover, excessive gaming can adversely impact both the physical and mental well-being of students. Lengthy periods spent in front of screens can contribute to obesity, eye strain, and poor posture. Furthermore, the competitive elements inherent in many games can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and reduced self-esteem. Additionally, exposure to violent and aggressive content may desensitize students to the repercussions of such actions, potentially encouraging aggressive tendencies in real-life situations.Rather than engaging in computer games, students should prioritize the development of essential life skills like critical thinking, problem-solving, and effective communication. Involvement in extracurricular activities, sports, and community service can cultivate teamwork, empathy, and a sense of social responsibility. This approach can help shape students into well-rounded individuals prepared for success in their future pursuits.In summary, the time spent playing computer games can significantly detract from students' academic responsibilities and jeopardize their physical and mental health. Therefore, students should not be permitted to engage in gaming, but instead should focus on enhancing vital life skills and participating in activities that foster their overall well-being and future achievements.
292;Do you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mails. Why?;When it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email, I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication. Firstly, team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently. Obviously, discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails. An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity. The first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email. The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one. The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other. Secondly, work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members. Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official, therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing. While if the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim. Therefore, less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members. Admittedly, sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place. Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none. Since it is a classroom or campus projects, there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas. While we should realize that in a project, there are numerous coordination works are required, if each opinion is communicated via email, there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience. In conclusion, I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email because work in person will be more efficient.;"The question of whether classmates or colleagues should collaborate on projects in person or through email has ignited considerable debate. Personally, I wholeheartedly believe that in-person collaboration is far more effective and advantageous than relying on email.Firstly, face-to-face interactions enhance communication and teamwork. When team members work together in person, they can engage in spontaneous discussions, exchange ideas, and leverage one another's strengths. This dynamic fosters a more unified and innovative final product. In contrast, relying on email often leads to misunderstandings, delays, and a lack of clarity, which can stunt the project's progression.Additionally, in-person collaboration nurtures a sense of camaraderie and teamwork. When individuals are physically present, they're more likely to develop ownership and accountability, which can boost motivation and productivity. This shared energy often dissipates when team members are isolated and dependent solely on email.Furthermore, working in person ensures immediate feedback and opportunities for problem-solving. Any obstacles or questions can be addressed right away, eliminating the delays associated with waiting for email replies. This not only accelerates the project timeline but also helps meet deadlines more effectively.While email communication offers convenience and flexibility, I believe the advantages of in-person collaboration significantly outweigh its downsides. In our increasingly digital world, it’s easy to rely on the convenience of email; however, for successful project work, face-to-face interaction remains the most effective approach. By collaborating in person, classmates and colleagues can harness each other’s creativity, expertise, and enthusiasm, ultimately resulting in a more fruitful and satisfying project experience."
293;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?;These days, more and more university professors are involved in scientific research. Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching. However, according to my experiences, professors should be encouraged to mainly do research.First of all, doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors. Universities are relatively fenced environment. The research projects provide communication with the outside. In addition, by doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies. I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college. He was often invited to do speech in other universities. Although my university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects. The research projects like windows opened to the wider world.Secondly, professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities. It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus. Also, you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together. Consequently, there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages. We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin. Universities positively contribute the professors' success. Last but not least, doing research could also improve the teaching quality. With the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom. They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice. I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project. By participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments. The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching. For those reasons, it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research. While extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society.;The role of university professors has been widely discussed, with some advocating for a stronger emphasis on research, and others arguing for a focus on student education. I believe that the primary duty of university professors is to educate, and as such, they should dedicate more time to teaching and mentoring.Though research plays a significant role in academia, it is not the sole responsibility of professors. Students attend universities to acquire knowledge, skills, and mentorship from seasoned educators. Professors have a unique opportunity to influence young minds, nurturing the leaders, innovators, and thinkers of tomorrow. By investing more time in their students, professors can offer the individualized attention, feedback, and support that are vital for both academic and personal development.Additionally, professors who prioritize teaching can cultivate a more engaging and interactive learning atmosphere. They have the ability to create curricula that are relevant, current, and tailored to their students' needs. This approach can enhance student satisfaction, improve academic performance, and boost graduation rates. Furthermore, professors actively engaged in teaching can also serve as role models, illustrating the significance of education and the benefits of lifelong learning.That said, research remains an important aspect of academic life, and professors should be supported in pursuing their research interests. Achieving a balance where professors designate specific times for research alongside teaching and mentoring is crucial. Ultimately, finding this equilibrium between these two vital components of academia will allow professors to further the advancement of knowledge while simultaneously inspiring and educating the next generation of leaders. By prioritizing teaching, professors can make a more direct and lasting impact on their students' lives, which, in my opinion, is their foremost responsibility.
294;Do you learn better by yourself or with a teacher ?;Every person learn in their own manner which they think that is most expedient to them. As for the learning by yourself, it has some certain profit. It gives you a chance to concentrate on what you learn cause there is no one who distracts your attention in presence of you, and your learning becomes more profound. In addition, the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework, Nevertheless, I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself. Firstly, The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies. In other words, when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out, that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly. In addition, professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge, and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study. They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages. Hence I, in my class, often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem, and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher. Secondly, in my mind, the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself. We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself. Furthermore, the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction. Moreover, This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree. knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened.Finally, of course, being without a teacher has shortcomings. Notable one of the shortcomings is that if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried, this might be ended in disappointment. I think that for one who depends on only himself in learning, his improvement of ability, with regard to cooperation and express his opinion, is unpromising. Hence I support this point that the learning with a teacher is better.;The discussion regarding whether individuals learn better independently or through a teacher has been prevalent for quite some time. While some individuals favor the conventional approach of learning with a teacher, others assert that self-directed study is more effective. In my view, both methods come with their own sets of advantages and disadvantages.On one hand, learning alongside a teacher offers a structured and guided educational experience. Teachers can provide personalized attention, respond to inquiries, and give feedback, all of which can be immensely beneficial. Furthermore, they play a crucial role in keeping students motivated and accountable, ensuring they remain focused and adhere to deadlines. For instance, in a classroom environment, a teacher can lead discussions, facilitate debates, and organize group activities, thereby enhancing the learning journey and fostering critical thinking.Conversely, self-study enables individuals to learn at their own pace, which can be especially advantageous for those who require additional time to comprehend specific concepts. Without the pressures of a classroom atmosphere, learners can revisit material as often as needed and study in environments that suit their preferences. Moreover, self-study fosters independence, self-motivation, and self-discipline—key skills that are vital for success in today’s fast-moving world.Ultimately, I contend that the most effective approach to learning combines both methods. With the support and guidance of a teacher, along with the flexibility and freedom of self-study, individuals can gain a deeper understanding of the material and cultivate a lasting passion for learning. By harnessing the strengths of both approaches, students can optimize their learning potential and achieve their academic aspirations.
295;Technology designed to make people's lives simpler often turns out to make them more complicated.;Many people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology. With newly developing technologies, people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy. For example, we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver's license or drive to bank for sending money. Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians. However, even with all the conveniences, we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated. There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer.Of course, new technologies are always great. However, it takes time for people to adapt them. Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day, many people often get lost. For instance, I use new Iphone which I personally think is great. However, even though I used it for couple months, I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently. At first, I tried to go through all the instructions but, soon, I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn. Next, technology destroys the language. Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others, they created their own language to communicate. Because people try to type as fast as they are talking, they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language. This has gotten worse with twitter, myspace, and facebook. What are even worse, young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions. To clarify, my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of. I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative.Although technologies allowed us to have a convenient life, it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above.;The emergence of technology has undeniably changed how we live, work, and communicate with one another. Although it is primarily intended to make our lives easier, it often produces the opposite outcome. Rather than simplifying our day-to-day activities, technology can bring about unexpected complications and challenges. Take, for example, the rise of social media platforms, which were designed to enhance communication and foster connections. Instead, they have resulted in an overwhelming flood of information, endless distractions, and the pressure to manage a carefully curated online image.Moreover, the advent of smart home devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) aimed to simplify household tasks and improve convenience. Instead, it has created a complex network of interconnected systems that demand regular updates, troubleshooting, and security maintenance. What was once seen as straightforward now involves navigating a complicated web of dependencies and potential risks. Even basic actions, such as adjusting a thermostat or locking the front door, require familiarity with Wi-Fi networks and smartphone applications.Additionally, our growing dependence on technology has sparked new anxieties and stressors. The fear of missing out (FOMO), the obligation to stay connected, and the stress associated with technical difficulties have become common concerns. The conveniences technology offers often come with an obligation to remain informed about the latest trends and to manage our digital presence. In summary, while technology holds the promise of making life simpler, it frequently introduces new complexities and challenges. As we continue to advance and incorporate technology into our everyday lives, it is crucial to acknowledge these unintended consequences and aim for a more balanced approach to technological development.
296;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"There are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion. As far as I am concerned, I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning. I list my reasons as follows.First, indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes. In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates, because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better, it will force you for making your performance more better. For example, When I was in First Year in B Com, I was not serious in my study, but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me, it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects. Finally I got 1st rank in final exam.Second, in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time. It makes you perfect in time management skills. Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others. It makes you communication and of course your group skills better, which can help you in your future and career.Third, professors play vital role in classroom learning, most of them are specialists is their subjects, and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills. You can improve your skills by work under any professor; you can ask questions face to face, it will clear your doubts. In result you learn quickly. For example, I have my personal experience. For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses, but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT, and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster.It's undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary, but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning. From the discussed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons.";The rise of distance-learning programs has fundamentally changed our approach to education, making it more flexible and accessible to a wider range of people. However, the debate over the effectiveness of these programs compared to traditional in-person college or university attendance continues. I believe that while distance-learning has its advantages, it may not be as effective as face-to-face education in certain respects.On one hand, distance-learning offers remarkable flexibility, allowing students to manage their time efficiently and juggle other commitments alongside their studies. This flexibility is particularly advantageous for working professionals and those with family responsibilities who cannot attend traditional classes. Additionally, distance-learning has a global reach, enabling students from various locations to access high-quality educational resources that may not be available in their area.On the other hand, traditional in-person education at colleges and universities offers distinct benefits that distance-learning programs often cannot match. The personal interactions, face-to-face discussions, and immediate feedback from instructors and peers are crucial components of the learning experience. These interactions not only deepen academic understanding but also help develop essential life skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. Furthermore, the campus environment provides students with a wealth of extracurricular activities, social engagements, and networking opportunities that are vital for both personal and professional growth.In summary, although distance-learning programs have reshaped the educational landscape and are certainly advantageous for many, I feel they do not provide the comprehensive educational experience that comes with attending classes in person. The blend of academic instruction, interpersonal interactions, and opportunities for personal development makes traditional education particularly valuable. Nonetheless, distance-learning will continue to hold an important place in education, especially for those who need flexibility or access to resources that are otherwise unavailable. Ultimately, the decision between distance-learning and traditional education should reflect an individual's unique circumstances, preferences, and goals.
297;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think this is a good idea? Support your opinion by using specific reasons and details.;"When we talk about student, we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college. In some country, teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study. However, some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study. In my view, it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he/she is still a student and this is for two reasons.The main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job, before starting their real job. Students can learn about time management, money management and convince people by their words. For example, when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year. As i had to spend some of my time in my job, therefore, i had to manage my time efficiently. I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework. This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively. Moreover, I learn money management. When my boss was out of the shop, i had to manage the accounts section of the shop. From this i learned, how to manage money correctly. This experience taught me, doing part time job can help students to learn many things.Another reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money, which can help their parents. For instance, when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor. I taught math to two kids of my neighbor. I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books. By tutoring them, i earned some money and bought me books with it. Moreover, after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents. As you can see, part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially.In sum, I am sure; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students. They will argue, it can destruct students from their study. However, as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result; therefore, i believe part time job will be good for students. Every Student should do part time job beside their study if they want to prepare more efficiently for their future.";In numerous countries, it's typical for teenagers to hold part-time jobs while they study. I strongly support this practice, as it offers a variety of benefits for young individuals. For one, working while studying equips teenagers with essential life skills such as time management, responsibility, and independence. By juggling work and education, they learn to prioritize their tasks, manage their time effectively, and make crucial decisions.Furthermore, a part-time job allows teenagers to earn their own money, fostering a sense of financial accountability. They can use their earnings for necessities, extracurricular activities, or even start saving for college tuition. This financial autonomy not only enhances their self-esteem but also boosts their motivation, as they gain a greater sense of control over their lives. Additionally, working can expand their social circles, as they interact with people from various backgrounds and improve their communication skills with coworkers and customers.However, it's essential to highlight that employment should not adversely affect their academic performance. Many countries enforce regulations on the maximum hours teenagers can work, ensuring that their education remains the primary focus. When balanced appropriately, holding a job can be beneficial for teenagers, providing them with practical experience and crucial life skills alongside their studies. In summary, I firmly believe that combining work with education is advantageous, as it nurtures independence, responsibility, and valuable skills that will serve them well in the future.
298;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Given advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Our World has varied cultures and each culture has its own language. It has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language as one do interacts with foreigners once in a lifetime and learning a foreign langauge adds on to a person skill-set as well. Also, I think its better that people learn foreign language in their own country. The reasons for holding that opinion are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs.First of all, it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language as it requires large amount of money and legal formalities. In the earlier periods, it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge. But with the advent of globalization, one can easily find a teacher in their own country. For example, in Indian sub-continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french, german etc.Second, colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum. Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university. So, it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country. Also, highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges.Third, technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country. A large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages.To sum up, it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country. It is cost effective and there is a pool of opportunities available now to accomplish the same.;The question of whether it is more effective to learn a foreign language at home or in the country where it is spoken has sparked considerable debate. Each approach has its own set of advantages, and the ideal choice ultimately depends on personal preferences and situations. In this essay, I will present the argument that immersing oneself in the language by studying in the country where it is spoken yields greater benefits.On one side, learning a foreign language in one’s home country offers certain advantages. For example, it is typically more convenient and often less costly than traveling abroad. Additionally, learners can benefit from qualified instructors who understand the local culture and can provide tailored support. However, this approach lacks the immersion and authentic cultural experiences that come with residing in a foreign country.Conversely, learning a foreign language in its native environment provides unmatched opportunities for language mastery. Being surrounded by native speakers allows students to grasp the subtleties of the language, including idioms, expressions, and accents that may be challenging to learn in a traditional classroom. Furthermore, living in a foreign country offers numerous chances to practice speaking, listening, reading, and writing in real-life contexts, thereby boosting language fluency. Everyday activities such as grocery shopping, using public transport, or engaging with locals can significantly enhance practical language skills.In summary, while learning a foreign language in one’s own country has its merits, I strongly contend that studying in the country where the language is spoken is the more effective approach. The immersive experience and cultural exposure available in a foreign country are unparalleled and cannot be replicated in a traditional classroom, making it the superior choice for those seeking to become proficient in a new language.
299;Some people believe that students should be given one long vocation each year. Other believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Everybody require some break from their tight schedules likewise students also require vacation form their intense academic schedules. Many people promote one long vacation system of the school because it would help student to start their course or academic year with strong zeal of learning. So other several, prefer numbers of short breaks during the year so that student can get rejuvenate periodically. In both the scenario students relief themselves. However, i discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics.Firstly, several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low. Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student's get relief form exam pressure. However, research done by universities proves that student's performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning, preparation and examination schedule. Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester. Also several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course.Secondly, scientific research provide several authentic survey of the students' performance after break. It states that students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation. To quote an instance, in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams. During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes. I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game. During my all vacations, I used to miss my school due to which I used to restart my session with great enthusiasm of learning and scoring good marks in new quarter.Vacations are not only required by students but also by professionals and housekeepers. As it not only provide break to them from their regular commitment but also allows them to spend some time on themselves, heel stressful mind and boost desire of resuming to the regular schedule. Therefore schools should consider giving several small vocations to the students during the year.;The ongoing discussion regarding whether students should enjoy one extended vacation or multiple shorter breaks throughout the year has generated significant debate. While some advocate for a single long holiday, I strongly believe that several brief vacations offer greater benefits for students.To start, shorter breaks help to avert burnout and sustain academic momentum. With intermittent vacations, students can recharge and regain focus, leading to enhanced concentration and productivity in their studies. For example, a break mid-semester can serve as a vital pause from academic pressures, allowing students to unwind and return to their work invigorated and motivated.Additionally, frequent short vacations encourage better time management and organizational abilities. Knowing that regular breaks are on the horizon, students are more inclined to prioritize their responsibilities and manage their time wisely, ensuring they keep pace with both their schoolwork and extracurricular commitments. This approach can significantly alleviate stress and anxiety, fostering a healthier and more balanced academic atmosphere.Conversely, a single extended vacation can result in a considerable gap in learning, making it challenging for students to readjust to their academic routine after returning. Moreover, such a long hiatus can disrupt structure and routine, potentially leading to unhealthy habits and a sedentary lifestyle.In summary, I believe that implementing multiple short vacations throughout the year is the more beneficial strategy. It promotes a healthy work-life balance, mitigates burnout, and nurtures vital life skills such as time management and organization. By embedding regular breaks into the academic calendar, educational institutions can cultivate a more supportive and productive learning environment that addresses the varied needs of their students.
300;"The expression ""Never, never give up"" means to keep trying and never stop working for your goals. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use specific reasons and examples to support your reasons.";"""Keep running!,"" shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move. During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014, I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute. At some moment, my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary. I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty. From this experience, I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals. Firstly, committing to our goal helps creating personal worth. For example, I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard. Even if I were not to win this medal, I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running. Secondly, one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger. I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line. However, I did not give up, and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself. I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning, and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger. Thirdly, at some point, we, as an average people, might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on. I believe that the responsibility is worthy of carrying. When the distance is longer and harder to achieve, a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself. He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal. For these reasons, I agree that one should not give up, as the true reward is to have the dignity. Anyone who wants to achieve the goal should acknowledge that his effort and experience from suffering helps him understand his true potential and increase his strength, and ultimately, it will prompt him to be ready for overcoming the greater challenge in his life.";"I wholeheartedly endorse the statement ""Never, never give up,"" as it highlights the crucial role of perseverance and determination in reaching our goals. This phrase, attributed to Winston Churchill, has motivated countless people to overcome difficulties and remain dedicated to their aspirations. In my view, surrendering is not an option when pursuing success, as it may result in lost opportunities and unrealized potential.One compelling argument in favor of this mindset is that every significant accomplishment demands persistence and effort. Take Thomas Edison, for instance. He is renowned for saying, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" His steadfast commitment to his work eventually led to a groundbreaking invention that transformed the world. Likewise, many successful figures, like J.K. Rowling and Stephen King, encountered numerous rejections before their talents were recognized, yet they never wavered in their pursuit of their dreams.Furthermore, giving up can lead to deep regret and disappointment. When people abandon their goals, they frequently ponder what could have been had they persevered. Conversely, overcoming obstacles can facilitate personal development, build resilience, and cultivate essential skills. By refusing to give up, individuals can learn from their failures, adapt to changing circumstances, and ultimately fulfill their ambitions.In summary, the phrase ""Never, never give up"" serves as a potent reminder to remain dedicated to our goals, even in the face of challenges. By adopting this attitude, we can tap into our full potential, achieve remarkable things, and create a lasting legacy. As Churchill eloquently stated, ""Never, never give up"" is a mantra that encourages us to exceed our limits and strive for excellence."
301;Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses. But isn't it better to save your money for later investments or rough times? Im my opinion, saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments, neither in your professional nor your personal life, furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams.First, there are several uncertainties about your professional future. The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account. As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe. Some of them had no own savings. They could not afford the rent, so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence.In addition, you can not be sure about the development in your personal life. It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings. Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car. He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it. Finally, with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams. Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished. For instance, I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend. Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream.Considering all the above mentioned arguments, from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time.;The long-standing discussion surrounding the decision to spend or save one's income has ignited fervent debates among people. Some believe that it is best to relish the fruits of one’s labor while they can, while others argue that prioritizing future savings is the wiser course of action. Personally, I believe that finding a middle ground between enjoying earnings and saving for the future is the ideal approach.On one side, indulging in one’s earnings can lead to significant joy and fulfillment. For instance, going on a vacation or purchasing a long-desired item can bring a sense of achievement and relaxation. Furthermore, investing in experiences—such as travel or acquiring a new skill—can generate lasting memories and foster personal development. For example, someone who has always dreamed of learning the guitar could use their savings for lessons, leading to both enjoyment and the acquisition of a new hobby.Conversely, saving for the future is essential for achieving financial security and stability. Setting aside funds for retirement, unforeseen emergencies, or major purchases like a home or vehicle can provide reassurance and alleviate financial worries. For instance, an individual who consistently saves a portion of their income each month can establish an emergency fund, making it easier to handle unexpected costs such as auto repairs or medical expenses.In summary, instead of taking an all-or-nothing stance, it is more beneficial to achieve a balance between gratifying one’s current desires and preparing for future needs. By designating a part of their income to both savings and enjoyable pursuits, individuals can experience the advantages of both strategies. This balanced approach fosters a richer and more secure life, allowing one to savor the present while also paving the way for a more stable future.
302;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Modern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously. However, while the majority of people live on the fast lane, others decide to reduce the speed and take their time. To draw an entire picture, we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better. In my opinion, it is very important to live life at a slower pace, because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages.First, living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health. If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off, your body will react to your stressful lifestyle. Many hardworking people have diseases, like the burn-out syndrome, because their bodies cannot hold the pace. For instance, my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job. After several weeks off his body was restored, now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine.In addition, living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness. If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved's. If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends. Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level. For example, a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it, because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships.Finally, quality takes time. When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush, you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes. Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities. As a result you might make mistakes, you would not have done with more patience. To illustrate, I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade, because I made few mistakes I could have avoided.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, living a slower life is advantageous for your health, your happiness and even the quality of your work.;The discussion about whether to live life at a fast or slow pace has been ongoing for ages. While certain individuals flourish in a bustling environment, I personally favor a more leisurely approach. I believe that this mindset offers a richer and more gratifying experience.One of the main reasons I choose a slower pace is that it allows me to savor the small joys of life. When I’m not constantly hurrying from one task to the next, I can take time to observe my environment and admire the beauty found in nature, art, and music. For example, enjoying a leisurely stroll through a park or forest lets me notice the vivid hues of flowers, hear the melodies of birds, and feel the sun’s warmth on my skin. This awareness fosters a deeper connection to the world around me and helps to alleviate my stress.Additionally, a slower pace opens the door to more meaningful relationships and experiences. When I'm not pressed for time, I can engage in deeper conversations with friends and family and enjoy activities that bring me happiness, like reading, painting, or playing music. Recently, I took a cooking class with a friend, spending the whole day learning to prepare a new dish. The experience was not only enjoyable but also strengthened our bond through our shared passion for food and cooking.In summary, while some thrive in fast-paced settings, I firmly believe that embracing a slower pace is essential for leading a happier and more rewarding life. By slowing down, I can appreciate the beauty that surrounds me, cultivate meaningful connections, and partake in activities that bring me joy.
303;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree with this point of view? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer;In the past centuries the population steadily grew and now, for the first time in history, is exceeding seven billion. As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing, feeding and industry. But isn't it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet? In my opinion, we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons.First, the natural diversity is very important for further generations. If we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet. As we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem. To illustrate, every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland. If we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct. As a result, further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals.In addition, a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather. Our behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming. This not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes. For example, recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average. This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions.;I challenge the perspective that human demands for farmland, housing, and industrial development outweigh the need to conserve land for endangered species. Although it's true that humans need land for various purposes, I contend that safeguarding habitats for endangered animals is just as important, if not more so.First and foremost, protecting land for endangered species is vital for preserving biodiversity and maintaining the balance of ecosystems. Endangered animals play crucial roles within their habitats, and their extinction can lead to significant ecological disruptions. For example, the decline of bee populations, which are key pollinators, can have catastrophic effects on agricultural yields. By prioritizing land conservation for these species, we can help ensure the long-term vitality and sustainability of our ecosystems.Moreover, there are innovative approaches to fulfill human requirements without infringing upon the habitats of endangered species. Techniques like vertical farming and thoughtful urban planning can reduce land usage while still satisfying human needs. Additionally, sustainable practices such as reforestation and harnessing renewable energy sources can lessen the environmental impact of human activities.Furthermore, conserving land for endangered species can yield economic advantages. Eco-tourism, which thrives on the preservation and appreciation of natural environments, can create substantial revenue and job opportunities. Additionally, protecting these habitats helps maintain critical resources like water and soil, which are essential for human survival.In conclusion, while it is important to address human needs, I strongly believe that conserving land for endangered animals is equally vital. By embracing sustainable practices and exploring alternative solutions, we can meet human demands while also safeguarding the natural world for future generations. We have a duty to protect and preserve our environment, and committing to the conservation of habitats for endangered species is a crucial component of that responsibility.
304;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.Ê;University students have different opinion about their attendance to class. Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students. According to my opinion, because it is university level of education, students have enough maturity to choose their choice. Therefore, I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students.To begin with, going to classes are sometimes waste of the time. For instance, some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module. Further, they didn't explain the contents in order to understand by the students. It was waste of the time. Because the university students have grown up, they have enough ability to read and understand the text book. Moreover, with the modern technology, students can collect more information from different sources. For example, from the Internet, students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently. However, some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way. When the students attend that lectures, they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time.Additionally, mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures. Besides, most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time. Students need to work as part time basis. Hence, they have to schedule the lectures time, studying time and working time. At the same time, rather than attending any boring lecturers, students can participate to other activities such as debate competition, swimming meet, Basketball and so forth. From that they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them. In a nutshell, although few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures, some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students' time. When the students go to university, they have matured mentally and physically. They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do. Therefore, to make use of time, if the students choose the classes as optional, it would provide more benefits than drawbacks.;The discussion surrounding whether university students should be obligated to attend classes has ignited considerable debate. While some advocate for mandatory attendance, others contend that it should be a choice. I support the notion that attendance should be optional for students.To begin with, enforcing mandatory attendance may actually hinder students’ interest in the subject matter. When students are compelled to attend, they may not engage fully, negatively affecting their overall learning experience. Conversely, allowing attendance to be optional empowers students to take charge of their education, attending only those classes that they find relevant and engaging. This strategy can lead to a more motivated and attentive learning atmosphere.Additionally, optional attendance enables students to better manage their time. Many university students juggle various responsibilities, such as part-time jobs, research projects, and extracurricular activities. By not enforcing attendance, students are free to prioritize their commitments and organize their time in a manner that best fits their individual circumstances. This flexibility can enhance productivity and promote a healthier work-life balance.Furthermore, optional attendance encourages self-directed learning and fosters independence. When students are not bound by mandatory attendance, they must take responsibility for their education, developing valuable skills like time management, self-motivation, and critical thinking. This independence is crucial in preparing students for the future, where self-management and autonomy are essential.In summary, while some may argue that compulsory attendance is key to keeping students on track, I strongly believe that making attendance optional is a better approach. Offering students the choice of when and how to attend classes can create a more engaging, adaptable, and independent learning environment.
305;Technology makes people's lives simpler rather than makes people's lives more complicated.;Believe it or not, nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not, thus making them confused. Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier. Although I conceded technology may make people's life complicated in some aspects, the convenience it brings is more. In what follows, I will illustrate my point of view.First, when it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler. With a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle. Alternatively, if you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times.Second, technology also makes teaching simpler. In the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers. With the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards, it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once.Admittedly, to some extent, technology may make people's life more complicated. For example, the cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications. For instance, folks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them. In addition, games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones. Consequently, making their life more complicated and tired. Based on the factors I have mentioned above, a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people's life complicated in some cases, the convenience it brings in people's are significant.;The emergence of technology has sparked discussions about its effects on people's lives. While some contend that it complicates life, I strongly believe that it actually makes it easier. Thanks to technological advancements, individuals now have access to a wide range of tools and services that enhance the efficiency and convenience of everyday tasks.One key way technology simplifies our lives is by providing immediate access to information and services. For example, the internet enables people to shop, pay bills, and communicate from the comfort of their own homes, eliminating the need for time-consuming trips. Moreover, mobile devices allow individuals to stay connected and gather information while on the move, facilitating better management of daily responsibilities and schedules.Additionally, technology automates a variety of routine chores, allowing more time for leisure activities. Smart home devices, for instance, can manage lighting, temperature, and security, making home management more efficient. Online banking and financial services further reduce the necessity for in-person bank visits, enabling individuals to handle their finances more conveniently.Furthermore, technology has significantly enhanced healthcare, education, and transportation, making these vital services more accessible and efficient. Telemedicine enables patients to consult with doctors remotely, minimizing the need for hospital visits. Online educational platforms offer a wealth of knowledge, allowing individuals to develop new skills and expand their understanding at their own pace.In summary, technology has undeniably simplified life for many. By offering instant access to information and services, automating everyday tasks, and enhancing critical services, technology saves time, energy, and effort. As technology continues to advance, it is poised to provide even greater simplicity and convenience in our lives, solidifying its role as an essential aspect of modern existence.
306;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines and other media pay to much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;"Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs. Others believe that television, newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well. This issue is a controversial one, but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons. One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples' lives in order to increase their audience or readership. Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs. Thanks to the Internet, we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don't need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience. Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip. Nowadays, unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training. Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos. Additionally, there are Reality TV, television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations, for example like ""Big Brother"".To sum up, it is clear that television, magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above, namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV.";I wholeheartedly agree that the media places excessive focus on the personal lives of notable individuals, including public figures and celebrities. In recent years, it has become increasingly prevalent for newspapers, magazines, and television programs to prioritize the private affairs of these stars, often neglecting more significant and meaningful news stories.A key factor in this phenomenon is the public's unending desire for gossip and scandal. The media responds to this craving, recognizing it as a profitable venture. Tabloids and celebrity-oriented magazines thrive on disclosing intimate details about the lives of famous people, frequently intruding on their privacy and ignoring their right to maintain certain aspects of their lives confidential. This not only impacts the celebrities involved but also establishes a troubling precedent regarding what content is considered acceptable and desirable by society.Moreover, this excessive focus on the personal lives of celebrities comes at the expense of more serious and consequential news. Vital topics like politics, economics, and social issues are frequently overshadowed by trivial stories about celebrity relationships, fashion choices, and personal controversies. This shift in emphasis diminishes the media's credibility as a reliable source of informative news, transforming it instead into a form of entertainment that favors sensationalism over substance.In conclusion, the media's fixation on the personal lives of celebrities is a trend that warrants reevaluation. By placing greater importance on meaningful and impactful news, the media can restore its role as a trusted source of information and foster a more informed and engaged public. It is crucial for the media to find a balance between entertaining the audience and informing them, rather than being preoccupied with the private affairs of celebrities.
307;Which do you prefer: staying in one place or moving in search of another place?;Some people may prefer to live in different places at different time because of many reasons such as looking for better job, house, community and so on. I prefer to spend my entire live in one place which is my hometown. In my hometown, I have a lot of friends and good relationships, I love the traffic in here, and the environment is wonderful.I was born and grew up in here, a small town. In here, I have a lot of friends, and we usually spend free time to play sports like soccer, basketball and of course we have a lot of fun. Every people in my town have known each others, and we have good relationships. If anyone needs help, his neighbor will help as much as possible. Nowhere else can give me some people like in here.I want to live here because I love the traffic system in here. We have large streets but few cars, so we can move easily to anywhere. Last week, I went to the city center to meet my friends. The traffic in the city was too crowed. I have to wait for an hour to go to my friend house.I also love the environment in here. I have been gone to some places to travel and stay for a short time, and I realize that the environment in some place isn't clean and fresh like my home town. There were a lot of people so the environment can't be keep clean.In conclusion, I strongly feel that staying in one place is better than moving number of places. Moving some places can give to you a lot of experiences but living in one place like your hometown can make you feel comfortable about the traffic, people and of course the environment.;The long-standing debate over whether to remain in one location or to seek new horizons has ignited passionate discussions among people. Some choose to stay put, valuing the comfort and familiarity that comes with it, while others believe that relocating is crucial for personal development and exploration. Personally, I lean toward the latter—the pursuit of new places.Relocating offers me the chance to immerse myself in diverse cultures, connect with new individuals, and adopt fresh perspectives. It expands my worldview and enhances my adaptability and resilience. Additionally, moving opens doors to learning new skills, tackling different challenges, and exploring new interests. Whether it means starting a new job, picking up a hobby, or pursuing a passion, relocating allows me the opportunity to reinvent myself and uncover different facets of my personality.Conversely, remaining in one place for an extended period can result in stagnation and complacency. Prolonged comfort can lead to overlooking opportunities that foster personal growth and development. Moreover, a lack of movement can restrict our exposure to new ideas, experiences, and viewpoints, potentially stifling our advancement both personally and professionally.In summary, while there are benefits to staying in one place, I firmly believe that moving in search of new environments is vital for personal growth, exploration, and self-improvement. It offers us the chance to encounter new experiences, forge new connections, and gain novel insights, ultimately shaping us into more well-rounded and open-minded individuals. Therefore, if I had the option, I would undoubtedly choose to seek out new places.
308;Students at universities often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. Where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.Ê;When it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school, most students always get confused between these two options: living in an apartment, or in university dormitories. As far as I am concerned, both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university. For instance, students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club, or joining sports club. Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates. In addition, it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question, they can easily ask for help to their roommates, classmates, or teachers. I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students. On the other hand, living off campus prepares students for the real life. For example, students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible, independent, punctual, co-operative compared to living in university dormitories. They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time, and dealing with the utility bills. In addition, students also have to focus on their study, and try to maintain their grades higher. Furthermore, students also have a chance to know about the community around them. Interacting with the people, and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation. From given the evidences, it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits. If I have to choose, I would definitely choose the second option: living in an apartment. I think that it teaches me everything that I certainly wants to learn in my life because learning all those characteristics would really help me in leading successful life.;Choosing where to live while attending university is an important decision that can significantly influence a student's overall experience. Two common options are residing in university dormitories or renting an apartment in the surrounding community. Each choice has its benefits, and the ideal option ultimately hinges on personal preferences and priorities.Living in university dormitories comes with various advantages. For one, it fosters a strong sense of community and camaraderie among students who are navigating similar experiences and interests. Moreover, dormitories are typically situated on or close to campus, making it easy for students to attend classes and engage in extracurricular activities. They also often provide numerous amenities, such as dining facilities, recreational areas, and study lounges, all of which can enhance the university experience.Conversely, opting for an apartment in the nearby community allows students to enjoy greater independence and autonomy. They have the freedom to select their own roommates, personalize their living spaces, and prepare their own meals, which can be a refreshing change from the regulations and structure of dorm life. Community apartments may also offer a more budget-friendly living option, particularly for those willing to share with multiple roommates.From my perspective, I would choose to stay in university dormitories during my first year. I believe the social interactions and convenience associated with dorm life would be invaluable for helping me acclimate to university and forge lasting connections with classmates. However, in my later years, I might consider transitioning to a community apartment to enjoy the independence and flexibility it brings. Ultimately, the decision on where to live is a matter of individual priorities and preferences, with each option presenting its own unique set of advantages and drawbacks.
309;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct.;Organizations, these days, seek to find people who can work extraordinary fast and carefully. These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company. Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal mentioned before. I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons. Trying to learn skills, working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice.To begin with, if persons work rapidly, they will have more chance to study. Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter. If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying, they can stares in their workplace. For example, I have a friend who was working so slowly. He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him. My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working.Most importantly, people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased. If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money. This fact pushes them to work faster and faster. For example, because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money, I am working in two organization to gain more salary. The more money, the more chances.Last but not least, people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks. If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly, your boss will assign you more tasks. If you do them fast too, the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder. It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation. Even if we ignore this result, by the same token, you can get higher position and more money.To sum up, I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky. Gaining more skills by study, having more than one job, and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages. I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice.;"The assertion that ""In today's world, it matters more to work quickly and risk errors than to take time and ensure everything is accurate"" is a divisive topic that ignites discussion among people. While some advocate for the necessity of speed in our fast-paced environment, I strongly disagree with this viewpoint.Working hastily, with the potential for mistakes, can result in numerous negative outcomes. In critical sectors like healthcare, finance, and engineering, errors can have dire and sometimes fatal consequences. The significance of accuracy and precision in these areas cannot be underestimated, and a rushed approach can undermine work quality. Additionally, mistakes can harm one's professional reputation, lead to financial setbacks, and jeopardize lives.Conversely, while taking a slower, more methodical approach may require more time, it assures a higher standard of quality and dependability. In many fields, thoroughness and attention to detail are crucial traits that separate experienced professionals from novices. By working carefully and thoughtfully, individuals can deliver results that are not only precise but also innovative and useful. Furthermore, investing time in reviewing and confirming work can avert costly blunders and help ensure the final outcome meets established criteria.In summary, although speed holds significance in today’s world, it should not overshadow the importance of accuracy and quality. Taking the time to ensure correctness often proves to be the superior strategy, as it leads to more reliable, efficient, and effective outcomes. By emphasizing precision and meticulousness, individuals can create work that stands out as exceptional and valuable. Ultimately, it's wiser to invest the necessary time to achieve accurate results than to rush and risk mistakes with potentially far-reaching ramifications."
310;Do you agree or disagree: It is not necessary for university students to attend classes as long as they can pass the exam.;Though out the last decade, the load of the university students has been constantly increasing. There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam. There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam. However, from my perspective, students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam. The reasons to be illustrated are follows. Firstly, the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject. For example, I love Physics. But I don't like electronics, because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world. And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics. But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics. And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again. Luckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach. And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics. And at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam.Secondly, if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated. If one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes. And the students will have nothing to do in the campus. Then he or she will play online games days and nights. The academic achievement will decline. In the end, this student will become a loser in the world. And all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class. This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system.Admittedly, the university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not. But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points.All in all, the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated.;The idea that university students don’t need to attend classes as long as they can pass their exams has ignited substantial debate. While some believe attending lectures is optional, I wholeheartedly disagree. Class attendance is a vital component of the university experience, offering numerous advantages that go far beyond just preparing for exams.Firstly, attending classes allows students to engage directly with their professors and fellow students, which enhances their grasp of the subject matter. Class discussions—filled with debates, inquiries, and clarifications—help demystify complex concepts and encourage critical thinking. Furthermore, students benefit from immediate feedback on their performance, enabling them to pinpoint areas for improvement. This interactive learning atmosphere cannot be replicated through self-study or online resources.In addition, attending classes cultivates key life skills such as time management, communication, and teamwork. Participating in class activities teaches students how to collaborate effectively, express their ideas clearly, and manage their schedules proficiently. These competencies are highly sought after by employers and are crucial for success in the workplace.Moreover, attending classes grants students access to resources and support that aren’t as readily available through online materials. Professors often offer personalized guidance, suggestions, and mentorship, which can be tremendously beneficial for achieving academic and career aspirations.In conclusion, while passing exams is indeed a significant part of university life, attending classes is necessary for a well-rounded education. It enriches the learning experience, fosters personal development, and provides essential resources and support. Therefore, I strongly argue against the notion that class attendance is unnecessary as long as students can pass their exams.
311;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? To improve the quality of education, universities should spend more money in salaries for university professors.  Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University education is always an important part of one's life. That's why education in university is discussed all the time. What is the best way to orientate the students? Raising the salaries of professors so? I would say no. The professors are essential, however, the schools are established for students. Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors. The following are my opinions. To begin with, the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors. I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively. By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment. A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer. Thus, students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning. That is to say, students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve. Thus, the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation. In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby. For me, I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment. It's unpleasant to stay at school. However, coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly.Besides, the ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better. To improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate. In addition, will the university filter all the professors overall? Some professors don't deserve the money at all, then, what's the point to spend money on them? High-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money. There won't be any effect if school does so. There was news about raising professors' salary in my country. This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly. The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries. As you can see, if the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen. At school, students are priority. Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university. That's the main reason I against providing more money to professors. Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition.;I firmly support the idea that universities need to allocate more funds to increase salaries for their professors in order to enhance the quality of education. A key reason for this is that competitive salaries are essential for attracting and retaining top talent within academia. When professors receive better compensation, they tend to be more motivated and committed to their teaching and research, ultimately benefiting the students. For example, research conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research indicates that institutions offering higher salaries report notable improvements in both teaching and research quality.Moreover, professors who are adequately compensated are less likely to seek additional employment to make ends meet. This enables them to devote more time and resources to their students, fostering improved mentorship and academic support. Additionally, universities that invest in their educators' salaries often witness enhanced student outcomes, including higher graduation rates and improved job placement following graduation.Furthermore, providing attractive salaries for professors can bolster the university's reputation, making it more appealing to prospective students and faculty alike. Prestigious institutions like Harvard and Stanford exemplify this, as they not only uphold high academic standards but also offer some of the best salaries in the field. This, in turn, enables them to recruit exceptional students and faculty from across the globe, cultivating a dynamic and enriching academic atmosphere.In summary, investing in professors' salaries is a vital strategy for elevating educational quality. By drawing and keeping exceptional talent, allowing faculty to concentrate on their responsibilities, and improving the university's standing, increased salaries can have a significant and positive influence on student performance and academic excellence. Therefore, universities should prioritize increasing compensation for their professors to create a superior learning environment for students.
312;Pets should be treated like family members. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Pets have always been essential in our society. Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds, tortoises and fishes as well. Some people think that pets should be treated like family members. However, others argue that they are just animals and aren't able to think like us. The issue is controversial but in my opinion, pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons.First, pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are. Similarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone. We can talk to them because they listen to us, more than some people will ever do. To illustrate this point, I can write about my own experience. When I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important. Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way. Since I was all alone at home for a long time, my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings. Clearly, although pets aren't able to speak with us, we can nonetheless count on them.Secondly, pets are useful for a variety of things. For example, nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before. Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses. There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone. In addition, pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better. Moreover, there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs. To sum up, I am strongly convinced that pets deserve to be treated like family members because of all the reasons mentioned above, namely they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations.;"The assertion that ""Pets should be treated like family members"" has ignited a passionate discussion among both animal enthusiasts and skeptics. Personally, I wholeheartedly support this viewpoint. Pets, particularly dogs, cats, and other domesticated animals, have become essential to our lives, offering companionship, love, and unwavering support. They enhance our daily routines with joy, comfort, and a sense of responsibility, much like human family members do.To treat pets as family means to provide them with the same love, care, and respect that we afford our human relatives. This entails creating a safe and welcoming home, giving them nutritious food, ensuring regular physical activity, and providing prompt medical attention. It also includes spending quality time together, engaging in play, and expressing warmth and understanding. In doing so, we deepen the bond between humans and animals, fostering a spirit of trust and mutual connection.Furthermore, treating pets as family members brings numerous advantages for both humans and animals alike. It can alleviate stress, anxiety, and feelings of loneliness in people while promoting better mental and physical health for pets. This approach can also cultivate a sense of community and social awareness, as pet owners become more attentive to their pets' needs and welfare.In summary, I am convinced that pets should be regarded as family members. They merit our love, care, and respect, and in exchange, they offer us companionship, affection, and a profound connection. By embracing pets as cherished members of our families, we can foster a culture of kindness, compassion, and understanding, ultimately nurturing a more harmonious relationship between humans and animals. Treating pets like family is not only a moral duty but also a gratifying experience that enriches our lives with joy and fulfillment."
313;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;This current world we situate ourselves in is rather unpredictable, even one sudden invention could bring down all the notions we used bear in mind. Most of us has endeavored to keep up with the pace of the development of today's world in fast pace. I personally believe that even when fast pace may be the wise move to correspond with today's world. However, it might not be the most beneficial move to our society.Primarily, even when the world operates in fast pace, it still requires accuracy. Even simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy. If we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes, we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline. In short, it only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless. It is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it. Certainly it may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times, but with consistent work soon enough we'll be able to bring up our speed in completion of work.Secondly, other than the importance of accuracy, the world also seeks efficiency, which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality. Even when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project, this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients. We soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace since when the problem reveals itself we'll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made. This might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start. Besides, when looking at this problem within a broader image. Some work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all, for instance, in official missions like the work done by NASA, a tiny mistake can be catastrophic. A miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars. In such circumstances, even when the scientists want to finish off quickly, but they couldn't miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems.To sum up, even when we need to catch up with the pace of the world, it is necessary for us to be extraordinarily cautious since rough work is intolerable when we want to stay competitive.;I wholeheartedly reject the idea that, in today's world, prioritizing speed over accuracy is a better approach than taking the time to ensure correctness. While efficiency and rapid output are certainly important in various situations, the significance of precision and attention to detail cannot be overstated.In numerous fields such as medicine, engineering, and finance, errors can lead to dire consequences, including loss of life, financial disaster, or a tarnished reputation. For example, if a doctor hastily makes a diagnosis and prescribes the incorrect medication, it could jeopardize a patient's health. Likewise, an engineer who rushes through the design of a bridge without thoroughly verifying calculations risks causing a disastrous failure. In these instances, it is not just preferable but vital to work methodically and ensure all details are accurate.Additionally, in today’s digital landscape, mistakes can rapidly gain traction and be challenging to correct. A single erroneous post on social media or a misleading news article can go viral, causing lasting damage to individuals or organizations. Thus, it is essential to take the necessary time to verify facts and confirm accuracy before releasing information into the public domain.In summary, while the advantages of working quickly may be apparent in certain contexts, it should not overshadow the importance of taking the time to ensure accuracy. Diligence and attention to detail are critical in many areas, where mistakes can lead to severe outcomes. Therefore, it is crucial to emphasize careful and thorough work over speed. By doing so, we not only enhance efficiency but also ensure that our work remains trustworthy and dependable.
314;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Continuous technological and economical development in modern world created great differences between cities, a difference that is clearly visible in the size of various cities. From cities with more that 20 million people to small towns inhabited by only hundreds of people. This diversities in cities allowed for more difference in people's preferences for where to live. For me, I prefer to live in bigger cities than in small ones, this personal attitude is the result of many factors.First of all, I find the excitement of big cities to be attractive, living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one's personality and open one's eyes on the real world. Life in big cities cities gives one new challenges every day, let it be deciding which restaurant to go to or deciding which company to work for. For me, this lifestyles is very attractive and is considered a huge advantage of big cities compared with the constant, slow paced life styles of small towns.Another thing that put big cities in front of small towns is the facilitates and services it contains which support and improve the quality of its inhabitants' lives, hospitals, advanced medical facilities can satisfy one's need of medical safety. Cultural events such as exhibitions and theatre plays can enrich one's and widen his horizons, things which aren't offered by small towns.Furthermore, it's undeniable that the economic power of a country is driven by it's big cities and the majority of wealth and finance is centered and controlled in big cities. With this kind of power big cities offer more opportunities for one's career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does, and higher income can be the basis of a happier, healthier life.Finally, although I prefer to live in a big city, I can not help but assure that this is a matter of personal taste, to be clear, I would love to spend some days in countryside to recharge my soul and relieve myself from daily stress.;When deciding where to settle down, many people find themselves caught between the allure of small towns and the energy of large cities. Personally, I lean towards city living. There are a number of reasons for this preference, starting with the vast opportunities that urban environments provide. Big cities serve as centers for education, career growth, and cultural experiences, boasting a wide variety of job options, prestigious universities, and numerous cultural venues, including museums, theaters, and concert halls.Another key benefit of living in a major city is the convenience and accessibility it offers. Cities are generally well-served by public transportation, which allows residents to navigate without needing a car. Furthermore, the round-the-clock availability of amenities and services means that anything you might need is always within reach, making city life particularly attractive for those who appreciate independence and flexibility in their routines.Additionally, the rich diversity found in large cities is a significant draw for me. These urban areas are vibrant melting pots of cultures, lifestyles, and ideas, creating a stimulating atmosphere. This diversity allows residents to experience a wide array of cuisines, festivals, and traditions, enhancing their social and cultural life. On the other hand, while small towns may offer a strong sense of community and peace, they often lack the dynamism and multicultural experiences that cities can provide.In summary, although both small towns and large cities have their own unique charm, I prefer the energy of city living. The opportunities for personal and professional development, the ease of accessing services, and the vibrant cultural scene all combine to make life in the city an exhilarating and fulfilling experience. For those who desire a fast-paced, dynamic lifestyle brimming with possibilities, a big city is undoubtedly the ideal place to call home.
315;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homes.;"The housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays. And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years. The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important. What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction.Building more accommodating constructions meets people's basic need. People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in. If the price of housing grows continuously, a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class. Then, ordinary people, especially the younger generation, will fall into a certain pattern - work, pay bills for housing, work; and I am sure that it will increase people's dissatisfaction of the government. Because when they are working, the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers, which will limit their efficiency. And government should spend money on people to rescue them from this, because only a government of the people, by the people, for the people will finally last; people's cohesiveness will be promoted.Otherwise, another vital reason why new building construction deserves more governmental investment lies in the fact that it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation. Build a new building has following prerequisites, land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures, a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor. Except these, hundreds of problems would occur during the construction. Thus, only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness. Generally, personally speaking, I believe new building construction hold the right to gain more money from government.";"I firmly believe that prioritizing government spending on new buildings over the preservation of historic and traditional structures is misguided. Historic buildings and homes are essential components of a nation’s cultural heritage and identity, and their preservation is crucial for fostering a sense of national pride and continuity.These structures often possess significant historical and architectural importance, offering invaluable insights into our past and reflecting the evolution and progress of the country. Additionally, preserving historic sites can yield economic advantages by attracting tourists and bolstering local businesses.While constructing new buildings is necessary for modernization and development, this can and should be achieved in harmony with existing historical architecture. The government ought to prioritize the safeguarding of historic buildings and homes, as they are irreplaceable; their loss through destruction or neglect means losing a vital part of our history and cultural identity.Moreover, the preservation of these historic buildings promotes sustainability by minimizing the demand for new construction materials and alleviating the environmental consequences associated with demolition and new developments. In summary, though the construction of new structures is essential for growth, it is far more important for the government to focus on preserving historic and traditional buildings and homes. These sites are invaluable elements of our cultural heritage, and the government should dedicate adequate resources to protect and maintain them for the benefit of future generations."
316;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support our answer.;I agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future. My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled, improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life.The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood. Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking, eating, etc., but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life. For example, when they tried to learn walking, they stumble and hurt themselves many times. But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk.All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations. No known scientist has success in first attempt. Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want. It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb. So, all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through.Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly. We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time, but when we think back about those moments later in life, we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves. When I moved to college hostel after school, first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known. I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted, but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them. I also became more casual and social with others, this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills. Therefore, to conclude my opinion on this statement, I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life. Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life.;I wholeheartedly agree with the notion that many of the challenging experiences we encounter in life ultimately transform into valuable lessons for our future. Everyone faces trials and obstacles throughout their lives, and the way we respond to these situations shapes our identities. Difficult experiences can serve as significant catalysts for growth, compelling us to adapt, reflect, and innovate.Take, for example, a student who fails an important exam. At first, this setback may feel overwhelming and disheartening. However, through reflection, the student may come to realize that they had underestimated the need for proper preparation and time management. This newfound understanding can inspire them to change their study habits and develop more effective learning strategies, leading to improved academic results in the long run.Another illustration is someone who faces job loss or a major career setback. While the initial reaction might be anxiety and disappointment, such a challenging experience can lead to critical self-reflection and the exploration of new career paths or industries that might align better with their interests. Additionally, it can instill essential qualities like resilience, perseverance, and adaptability in the face of uncertainty.In summary, the difficult experiences we endure often become crucial learning opportunities. They enable us to learn from our missteps, gain new perspectives, and cultivate important life skills. By welcoming challenges as opportunities for growth, we can turn what seems like adversity into meaningful lessons that enhance our personal and professional lives. Thus, it is clear that many experiences that initially feel burdensome ultimately evolve into invaluable lessons for the future.
317;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Drivers have to pay a fee for driving in busy city streets when there is a great amount of traffic.;"Started in the late eighteenth century, the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles. The very fuel that they rely on, oil, has now become the dominant pollution of cities' environment. While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts, I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them. The reasons are the followings. Capitalism enfranchised people's right to own properties, and consequently, their rights to use them. Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities's environment, but laws protect drivers to do so, and accordingly, charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction. From another point of view, traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban; so it is out of drivers' control. Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time? Wars are notorious, but you can't blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries.Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear. Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous. Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance, and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights.Rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee, government should instead, be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil. Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light, or unreasonable organization of roadways. In these cases, the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner, not drivers. Simply put, charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful. In conclusion, ""rush hours"" are usually not the direct consequence of drivers. Instead, the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds, and therefore, charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational.";The proposal that drivers should pay a fee to navigate congested city streets during peak traffic times is a divisive topic. Personally, I support this idea. Introducing a congestion charge can significantly alleviate traffic issues in urban areas, as it would deter drivers from using busy streets at high-traffic times, thus lowering the volume of vehicles on the road.A key benefit of this fee is the revenue it would generate for the city, which could be allocated to enhancing public transportation services like buses and trains, as well as improving overall infrastructure. This would provide commuters with more efficient and reliable alternatives to driving, resulting in further reductions in personal vehicle usage. Additionally, less traffic would contribute to decreased emissions, leading to a cleaner and healthier living environment for city residents.Furthermore, a congestion charge would encourage drivers to reconsider their travel plans, prompting them to explore alternative transportation options such as carpooling or ride-sharing services. This not only reduces traffic but also fosters a sense of community among commuters. However, it is crucial that the fee is implemented fairly and does not unduly burden low-income individuals who depend on their vehicles for daily travel.In summary, while there are arguments against the fairness of a congestion charge for drivers, I strongly believe that the advantages—such as reduced traffic, improved air quality, and better public transportation—far outweigh the drawbacks. By instituting this fee, cities can establish a more sustainable, efficient, and environmentally friendly transportation system, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for urban residents.
318;Agree or disagree: one of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;"Nowadays, the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger. If students want to get used to the society quickly, it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs. There are some reasons can support my view.First, there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university. Because most people they contact with are also students. However, when students do part-time jobs, they can work with many kinds of people, and most of whom are adults. So, they can teach students many things about adult life. My friend Lisa, who is doing part-time job now, tells me that it is fabulous to take it. Through part-time job, she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life. For example, Lisa thought in adult life, work is the core; but after she knows these friends, she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work. Hence, thanks to the information her new friends has provided; now she is more confidence about her future adult life. Second, parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life. However, because we do not experience it, it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be. Therefore, we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be. Actually, some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs, they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job. Therefore, the part-time job can make people understand future life better.Third, some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student' study. Actually, most students will do the part-time job in their holiday, so it will not effect on their study. Compared with playing computers every day, doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday.In conclusion, taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it. Therefore, parents should encourage students to take the part-time job.";I firmly believe that one of the most effective ways for parents to help their teenage children prepare for adulthood is by encouraging them to pursue a part-time job. Such employment offers invaluable learning experiences for teenagers, equipping them with essential skills and attributes that will serve them well throughout their lives.To begin with, a part-time job instills a sense of responsibility and time management in teenagers. Balancing work with academic commitments teaches them to prioritize tasks effectively, a crucial skill needed for navigating the demands of adult life, where managing multiple responsibilities and adhering to deadlines is essential.Additionally, working a part-time job allows teenagers to cultivate vital life skills, including communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. Engaging with coworkers, customers, and supervisors helps build their confidence in interacting with diverse individuals from various backgrounds and professions. Furthermore, handling financial transactions and making money-related decisions enables them to appreciate the value of money and foster good financial practices.Moreover, having a part-time job can significantly enhance a teenager's self-esteem and sense of independence. Earning their own income fosters pride and autonomy, enabling them to make personal purchasing choices and take charge of their finances. This prepares them for the financial realities of adulthood, such as managing bills, saving, and investing.In summary, encouraging teenagers to embrace part-time work is a highly effective strategy for parents aiming to prepare their children for adult life. It imparts valuable skills, offers essential real-world experiences, and promotes independence and accountability. Therefore, I am convinced that gaining work experience through a part-time job is a critical step in a teenager’s journey toward adulthood.
319;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Study achievements depend on a range of various factors, one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying. In particular, we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone. As for me, I favor the latter because of the following reasons.To begin with, type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one. Being by nature introvert, I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people. Once, when I was working on presentation with strangers, I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people. Therefore, my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper.Furthermore/moreover, working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork. In other words, I must not divide tasks and duties between team members, share responsibility and benefits, and spend time on teambuilding. These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time. About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game. To my rivals' surprise, being the only member of my own ""team"" I gained a victory.In conclusion, from my point of view, type of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone.";People have varying preferences when it comes to studying. Some students like to study alone, while others thrive in group settings. Personally, I prefer studying with a group, and this inclination comes from the many advantages that collaborative studying presents.To start, studying in a group facilitates the exchange of knowledge and ideas. When peers gather to study, they each contribute their distinct viewpoints and understandings of the subject. This collaborative effort leads to a richer comprehension of the material, as members can share insights and clarify misunderstandings. For example, I had difficulty grasping a specific math concept, but my study group helped me by explaining it in a way that resonated with me.Additionally, group studying fosters active learning and engagement. When students work together, they are more inclined to participate in discussions, pose questions, and engage in activities that reinforce their learning. This interactive style not only keeps students engaged but also enhances motivation and focus, as they benefit from each other's knowledge and maintain accountability. For instance, my study group frequently quizzed one another, which helped us manage our workload and retain information more effectively.In summary, I strongly believe that studying with a group is both a more effective and enjoyable method. It promotes the sharing of ideas and knowledge while encouraging active engagement and participation. By collaborating with others, students can deepen their understanding of the topics, maintain motivation, and work towards their academic objectives. Ultimately, group studying creates a supportive and collaborative learning environment that is crucial for achieving academic success.
320;Some people prefer to work for themselves or own a business. Others prefer to work for an employer. Would you rather be self-employed, work for someone else, or own a business? Use specific reasons to explain your choice.;Most people want to work for an employer, because they want to feel secure about their salary, or feel comfortable about other problems of having own job such as paying tax, worrying about selling, etc. Despite these problems, personally, I would prefer to have my own job. My arguments are listed as follows. First, time is the more valuable thing, which I have in my life. By having my own business, I can manage my own time. I could work whenever I want, or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay. I can arrange time to travel when I would like. In addition, I can work long hours for earning more money. Totally, the most important reason for me to be self-employed is the sense of free. Moreover, earning money is the fundamental reason that why people work. The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job. If I work for other people, I have to give my ideas to employers cheaply. Therefore, I never have been rich in my life, because my salary is not dramatically changed. In spite of many problems of having own business, I can earn more money based on my creativity and personal ideas. To sum up, in spite of the fact that many people are not eager to work for themselves, I would like to run my own business to control my own time, and to earn more money based on my noble ideas.;When it comes to career decisions, some people prefer the independence and flexibility of being self-employed, while others appreciate the stability and security that comes with working for an employer. Personally, I lean towards owning a business. This preference is rooted in the potential for limitless income, the chance to follow my passions, and the ability to create jobs and positively impact the economy.Owning a business allows me to bring my ideas to life, developing a product or service that I truly care about. This fulfillment and sense of purpose drive me significantly. Additionally, being my own boss means I can make choices that reflect my values and vision, rather than adhering to a fixed corporate structure. I have the freedom to set my own hours, build my own team, and steer my company's direction.Another compelling reason I favor entrepreneurship is the financial potential it offers. As a business owner, my earnings are directly linked to my effort and commitment, meaning I can enjoy the fruits of my labor. In contrast, a traditional job often comes with a fixed income, capping my earning potential. Furthermore, owning a business enables me to generate employment opportunities and support the local economy, which is an immensely gratifying aspect of entrepreneurship.While both self-employment and traditional employment come with their own benefits, owning a business presents an ideal fusion of autonomy, financial possibilities, and purpose. It allows me to pursue my passions, create something unique, and make a tangible difference in my community. For these reasons, I firmly believe that owning a business is the career path for me, as it provides the freedom, flexibility, and fulfillment I desire.
321;Should a city try to preserve its old, historic buildings or destroy them and replace them with modern buildings? use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones, but these revolutions should not include historic buildings. The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors. In addition, they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists. Historic buildings answer many questions, which are mysterious about our previous ancestors; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings. They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city. They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago. They show us how they survive, or how they defend themselves etc. By investigating about their structures, we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building. In the other hand, historic buildings are important treasures, which provide an area to learn valuable lessons. Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city. It is interesting for most people to know about the way people live in thousands years ago. Therefore, It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors. Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on. These are reasons that why we should preserve historic buildings in the city. They can benefit us financially by developing other industries. Moreover, they are the symbols of our nations, which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors.";"The ongoing debate regarding the preservation of historic buildings versus their replacement with modern structures has persisted for years. I believe that safeguarding these historic sites is vital for upholding a city’s cultural and historical identity. Such buildings act as links to the past, providing insight into the city’s rich heritage and fostering pride among its residents.Replacing historic sites with contemporary architecture can result in a loss of character and individuality. Take Paris, for instance; its renowned historic landmarks—like the Eiffel Tower and Notre-Dame Cathedral—draw millions of tourists annually. Should these iconic structures be substituted with modern designs, the city's distinct charm and allure would diminish. Moreover, preserving historic buildings can also yield economic advantages, as they can be transformed into museums, hotels, or restaurants, thus creating employment opportunities and generating revenue.Additionally, there are environmental considerations to take into account. The demolition of old structures and the construction of new ones require substantial energy and resources, which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and waste. In contrast, renovating and repurposing existing buildings can help minimize waste and lessen environmental impact. A great example is Barcelona, which has effectively maintained its historic Gothic Quarter while integrating modern amenities, presenting a sustainable urban development model.In summary, protecting historic buildings is essential for preserving a city’s cultural heritage, fostering economic development, and minimizing environmental impact. Instead of demolition, cities should focus on renovating and repurposing these sites, ensuring their sustainability and relevance in contemporary society. By doing so, urban areas can achieve a harmonious blend of preservation and progress, fostering a vibrant environment that honors its history while looking towards the future."
322;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Learning is a thing that we do in all of our lives. Getting the best lessons, besides our abilities to self-study, depends on our teachers a lot. There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers. I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons.Firstly, parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life. As we were born, parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile, how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating. Moreover, when we grow bigger, they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives.Secondly, at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages, but after school we learn from our parents. In my opinion, we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school. I think when we leave school, maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life, but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day. For example, I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me.Thirdly, I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally. Therefore, even when we grow older, get married and then have our own families with spouses and children, parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life. For instance, my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life, he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice.To conclude, I strongly believe that parents are our best teachers.;I wholeheartedly agree that parents are the most effective teachers. From an early age, children view their parents as role models and absorb invaluable lessons from them. Parents uniquely influence their child's morals, values, and behaviors, solidifying their role as the most impactful educators in a child’s life.One key reason parents excel in teaching is their ability to offer personalized attention and support. Unlike school teachers, who must cater to many students, parents can concentrate on their child's specific needs and learning styles. For example, my mother taught me to read and write at home long before I entered school. She made the learning process enjoyable and engaging, utilizing creative techniques that helped me understand complex ideas with ease.Additionally, parents impart essential life skills and values crucial for success. They instill qualities such as honesty, discipline, and responsibility, which are fundamental for achieving goals and overcoming obstacles. My father's stories of his own challenges and victories taught me the significance of hard work and perseverance. These lessons have remained with me and continue to inspire me.Moreover, parents are always there for their children, providing a reliable source of support and guidance. They can offer advice and encouragement whenever needed, helping their children manage life’s challenges. In summary, although formal education is important, I firmly believe that parents are the best teachers. They deliver personalized guidance, instill vital life skills, and provide continuous support, making them the most effective and influential educators in a child's journey.
323;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Workers would be much happier if they are doing different types of tasks during their workday than doing the same task.;"In my family, the argument topic between my father and mother always involves my father's job. Five years ago, he quitted his 20 years job as an architectural engineer, and became a landscape painter. Every time I asked him why, he will say, seriously,"" I am done, doing this same work for 20 years and I really want to try some different, that is all."" While there are innumerous people will deem it ridiculous and argue doing the same task is the meaning of job, but from my perspective, I am on the side of my father.Most of workers have adapted to do same task. It allows us to achieve more. As a authoritative dentist in my province, my mother has worked for 25 years. Gandhi devoted his whole life to fight against British-ruled government and inspire movements for civil rights in India, finally he became the father of the nation. These examples make it obvious that great achievement needs someone keen on one task for long time. While when it comes to ""happier"", different type of jobs can be responsible factor.Doing different tasks makes employees and employers much happier. Workers, who work for an ordinary company or industry, will be sick of same tasks day by day. Although they can be familiar with their job, changing of job is what serve to their happier. Changing the type of work will be fresh and elicit their potential to adapt a new environment, which, according to psychology theories, makes workers relaxed and happier. To set another example, consider every workers have ability to do several kinds of work, employers will be satisfied by the generating benefits. They both will be happy because the change of job, not the same task day by day.Different types of tasks during workday brings more challenges, making life colorful. Just like a song, if I did not have challenge, life would be blue. As an engineering researcher, I will surely be disappointed for failure, and exited for new challenges. New challenges from different tasks amounts far more than more works, it also means through dealing with it, I will obtain more knowledge and experience. As the saying of a Chinese writer, the color of life is rooted not in Japanese cherry blossom or Canadian maple leaf, but rather there always exists new things and challenge. After all, doing same task day and night just server to increase our psychological burden, connecting with different types of job is capable give us more colors to our life.To sum up, I admire my father's choice, while the same task give us opportunities to be an expert, like my mom, I still hold the firm view that different types of tasks endow more colors to our life.";I wholeheartedly support the idea that workers are likely to be much happier when they engage in a variety of tasks throughout their workday, rather than performing the same one repeatedly. The repeated nature of tasks can lead to boredom, dissatisfaction, and diminished motivation among employees. When staff members are encouraged to take on diverse responsibilities, they tend to remain more engaged, motivated, and interested in their jobs.Engaging in different tasks during the day can also mitigate burnout and alleviate stress. Repetitive work can create a sense of stagnation, making the job feel monotonous and unsatisfying. Conversely, when employees are presented with a range of tasks, they have the opportunity to utilize different skills, challenge themselves, and achieve a sense of accomplishment.Moreover, varied tasks enable workers to learn new skills and expand their expertise, contributing to greater job satisfaction and personal fulfillment, as well as boosting their confidence and self-esteem. Additionally, the ability to switch tasks allows employees to take mental breaks from demanding work, helping them recharge and enhancing their overall productivity and performance.In summary, integrating diverse tasks into the workday can greatly enhance employee happiness and job satisfaction. By offering opportunities for skill development, self-challenge, and a sense of achievement, employers can foster a more engaging and motivating workplace. Thus, I firmly believe that workers would be far happier when involved in a variety of tasks rather than being confined to a single repetitive one.
324;Do you agree or disagree with the statement, in order to succed in doing a new job, the ability to adapt oneself in a new environment is more important than excellent knowledge of this job.;With the rapid development of economy, the controversial of good worker's requirement is always in a limelight. A large number of people will say the ability to adapt oneself to a new environment is necessary, because it is the basic communication skill for a new worker. From my perspective, there is only one thing would be beneficial to company, and there is only one way to be an outstanding worker, that is possessing excellent knowledge of this job. That's why I believe that the excellent knowledge of this job will be more significant.Admittedly, the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job. This ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates, cooperating with other workers needs this ability, too. But working alone is a longer-term job than communicating, that is, the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker, but the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave. The company will benefit from every worker of excellent knowledge. The core and most profitable technology of an IT company is invented by a worker with excellent computer knowledge, not a worker with outstanding communicating skill. The high reputation and popularity of a company is earned by some brilliant workers in public relation department with excellent skill to propagate this company. So the company will earn more money and reputation from these workers with excellent knowledge. Employees will obtain reward from hard-work pursuing excellent knowledge. Through our whole study life, undergraduate and graduate, we keep learning with the purpose of exerting these knowledge and experience on our job, just like an old Chinese scholar said, the essence of study is utilizing it. After we get a job, the destination of we keep accumulating and collecting knowledge is rooted not in fawn on our manager with the ability to adapt this kind of business culture, but in making us excellent and totally master this job. Finally, we will be rewarded with pride. That's why we can obtain reward from out excellent knowledge.To sum up, I would have to say that although we can use the ability of adapting oneself in a new environment, the excellent knowledge will be of more importance. Because it can not only benefit our employers, but also ourselves will be rewarded.;I concur with the idea that adaptability in a new environment is more critical for success in a new job than merely possessing extensive knowledge of the role. While expertise in one’s field is advantageous, it is not the sole determinant of success. Adaptability plays a vital role, enabling individuals to navigate workplace dynamics, forge connections with colleagues, and grasp the organizational culture.Knowledge of the job can be developed through training and experience. However, adapting to a new environment is a skill that necessitates emotional intelligence, flexibility, and resilience. Someone who is highly knowledgeable may struggle to apply their expertise if they are unable to adjust to their new surroundings. For example, they might have difficulty collaborating with new coworkers, adapting to different work schedules, or managing the pressures associated with their new position.Conversely, an individual who adapts swiftly to a new setting can effectively learn job requirements and excel in their role. They can cultivate strong relationships with colleagues, understand supervisor expectations, and tackle job challenges with confidence. Moreover, adaptability allows an individual to remain open to new ideas, viewpoints, and constructive criticism, which is essential for ongoing learning and progress in a new position.In summary, while having in-depth knowledge of the job is valuable, the capacity to adjust to a new environment holds greater significance for achieving success in a new role. Adaptability serves as the foundation upon which other skills—including job expertise—are developed. By embracing their ability to adapt, individuals position themselves for success and can realize their objectives in their new job.
325;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Computers have revolutionized our lifestyle during last century. However, some people especially young ones use computers extremely and this excessive usage lead to increase stress among them, but computers have brought many advantages to our lives. From my point of view, computers have an important and inevitable role in economic, business, and other part of societies. In addition, they make the way of living easier by doing our routine duties. Admittedly, by using computers in many industries human's role has been reduced. Nowadays, computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries, which were early done by human. Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks, which were carried out by human early. For example, many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots, which are controlled by computers. In addition, car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers. Despite many advantages, by coming computers many jobs has been vanished. A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers. Computers have an important role in social and personal life. Computers have opened up a network connection among people. This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message. Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers. Moreover, People can use computers to extract their essential information easily. By contrast, excessive use of computers has brought many difficulties. The results show that teenagers who are addicted to computer games show more violent and stressful behaviors. People who have type by computers may suffer from such disease related to knees. By considering all reasons, advantages of computers outweigh disadvantages. People benefit more from coming computers into their lives. In addition, computers can do most difficult tasks which leads to make life easier.;The rise of computers has ignited a lively discussion regarding their influence on our daily lives. While some contend that computers have complicated and added stress to our existence, I am convinced that they have simplified life and increased convenience. In my view, the advantages of computers significantly surpass their disadvantages.To begin with, computers have transformed the way we communicate. Through emails, social media, and video calls, we can effortlessly connect with friends and family members who live far away. This has facilitated the maintenance of relationships and saved both time and money that would otherwise be spent on travel and mailing. For instance, I can easily keep in touch with relatives living abroad via regular video chats, which has strengthened our bond despite the physical separation.Moreover, computers have greatly improved our ability to access information and learn new things. The internet provides an abundance of educational resources, including online courses, tutorials, and informative websites. This access allows us to acquire new skills and broaden our knowledge at our own pace and convenience. For example, I can now study a new language or acquire a skill from the comfort of my home, unlocking fresh opportunities for personal and professional growth.In summary, although some individuals may argue that computers contribute to a more complex and stressful lifestyle, I maintain that their benefits greatly outweigh the negatives. Computers have streamlined communication, enhanced information access, and made learning more attainable. Overall, they have made life easier and more convenient, and I believe their positive impact will resonate for generations to come.
326;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?Children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.;Learning a foreign language is necessary for children to strengthen their ability to learn. Whether children should start learning a foreign language as they start school or not might be a controversial issue. It seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school. Learning that not only help them to improve their minds and memories, but can extend their visions about the other countries. First, the ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life. Thereby students in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language. They can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies. It is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives. By considering this and being aware of that students have not any responsibility and other difficulty in comparison with a young man, we can infer that why this time is the best time to learn any language.In addition, Learning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World. They would be able to understand other cultures and costumes. Moreover, It can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World. Having knowledge about other countries and their languages lead to extend the child's vision. Therefore, they would be able to develop their personalities and sense of reliance. Overall, it is easy to distinguish between a child having two languages and a child having just his native language while comparing their ability to communicate, understanding other studies, etc, to find that why children should start learning a foreign language in the beginning of the education.;I wholeheartedly support the idea that children should start learning a foreign language as soon as they enter school. Introducing a foreign language early on offers a multitude of cognitive, social, and cultural advantages that can benefit them throughout their lives. To begin with, young children's brains are particularly adept at absorbing new sounds, vocabulary, and grammatical structures, which facilitates the acquisition of a new language. Studies indicate that those who begin learning a foreign language at an early age generally achieve higher proficiency compared to those who start later.In addition, early foreign language education can boost children's overall academic performance. It has been shown to enhance memory, problem-solving skills, and the ability to multitask. For example, research conducted in Spain revealed that preschoolers who learned English outperformed their later-starting peers in reading, writing, and mathematics. Furthermore, learning a foreign language exposes children to diverse cultures, enriching their perspectives and promoting global awareness.Countries like France and China have effectively integrated foreign language instruction into their elementary school systems. In these nations, children as young as five or six begin their foreign language education, yielding notable results. These youngsters often become proficient speakers, capable of engaging with individuals from various backgrounds. In summary, initiating foreign language learning at the beginning of a child’s education can significantly influence their cognitive, social, and cultural growth. It is an investment in their future, providing a valuable skill that opens up numerous opportunities in our increasingly interconnected world. Thus, I firmly advocate that children should start learning a foreign language as soon as they begin school.
327;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Boys and girls should attend separate schools. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Women or men almost need each other in full of life even in school. Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education, others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender. In my opinion, boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex. School is a small society for students, which prepares them for the future life. By attending to the same school, students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate. In addition, a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa. They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study, how communicate with girls in a group, etc. Admittedly, when they study together and help each other, they exercise the the real life as they age. By contrast, some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them. By doing this, outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship and as result, their thoughts deviate from the studies. Moreover, attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better. Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class, therefore they will study increasingly. Indeed, Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa. As a result, the productivity of the class will be increased. In a word, attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages. Taking part in the study groups would increase student's motivation to study more. In addition, they would be able to know the opposite gender, which help them to be prepared for the adult life where they almost will live or work together.;I do not agree with the idea that boys and girls should be educated in separate schools. Although some proponents of single-sex education argue that it creates a more focused and distraction-free environment, I contend that co-educational schools offer significant advantages that far surpass those of separate institutions.First and foremost, co-educational settings encourage interaction between boys and girls, fostering social skills, empathy, and understanding. When students of different genders share a classroom, they can exchange viewpoints, challenge one another’s ideas, and build healthy relationships. This interaction is crucial in equipping students for the real world, where collaboration and communication with individuals of all genders is the norm.Furthermore, co-educational schools provide equal opportunities for participation in various activities, including sports, music, and art. This inclusive approach helps dismantle gender stereotypes and allows all students to pursue their interests without the constraints of traditional gender roles. For instance, a girl might shine in a sport traditionally associated with boys, like soccer, while a boy might discover a passion for dance or music.Lastly, attending a co-educational school aids in the development of essential life skills, such as communication, teamwork, and conflict resolution. Learning alongside peers of different genders enables students to gain a deeper appreciation for each other’s strengths, weaknesses, and perspectives, thereby nurturing a more inclusive and respectful society.In summary, while there are some perceived benefits to separate schools, I firmly believe that co-educational institutions provide a more holistic and enriching educational experience. By learning together, boys and girls cultivate the social, emotional, and academic skills necessary for success in life. For these reasons, I strongly oppose the notion that boys and girls should attend separate schools.
328;Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. In your opinion, what does success come from? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. ;"""The biggest risk is not taking any risk."" The ones who have a big dream, they need to be brave and dare to live new situations. It is not guaranteed that you are going to achieve your dream if you had planned carefully as the same way when you take risks, but it is more frustrating if you had made plans and then it went wrong. Therefore, it is essential to take chances and believe this is going to work out. Assuming new opportunities is indispensable to have diverse experiences. In fact, life may not be easy; it will have various challenges especially when you take risks, but in the end, it can be surprisingly wonderful. For instance, some people abandon their job, family and friends and go to other country without knowing what the future holds for them. In the beginning, it can be tough to fit in this new place and find any opportunity, but after fighting against the obstacles blocking the way to get what is desired; it is possible to conquer what they are craving as well as start to build a new life in this other country. In fact, many people are afraid to take risks and fail. It is possible to get frustrate along the way, but it is vital to never give up on your dream. To illustrate, Walt Disney, whose career is famous, had a challenging life. One of the difficulties was some of his histories, such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs, were turned down. He heard lots of ""no"", furthermore one editor fired him alleging that he had no imagination, after all what he had gone through, he never stop chasing his dreams. To conclude, in this competitive world you have to be fearless and face all new situations. Even though sometimes you consider backing down and stay in the same routine that you are used to, it is necessary to have courage to take risks, be different and pursue your dream to have a successful life.";"The long-standing debate over the sources of success has generated lively discussions across various segments of society. Some believe that success is rooted in taking risks, while others argue that it is achieved through careful planning. In my view, the secret to success lies in finding a balance between these two strategies.On one side, embracing risk can open doors to remarkable opportunities and personal growth. Pioneering entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk have transformed their industries by welcoming uncertainty and challenging the status quo. Their capacity for taking calculated risks has allowed them to innovate and maintain a competitive edge. However, relying exclusively on chance can be imprudent and may lead to unnecessary setbacks.On the flip side, thorough planning lays the groundwork for success, equipping individuals to foresee and navigate potential challenges. A well-structured plan can reduce risks and enhance the chances of reaching one's objectives. For example, athletes who meticulously design their training routines and strategies often excel beyond their more spontaneous peers. Still, placing too much emphasis on planning can hinder creativity and flexibility.In the end, I contend that success is the product of both risk-taking and careful planning. By evaluating potential risks and rewards, individuals can make informed choices that blend caution with ambition. This balanced approach is exemplified by Thomas Edison's determination in creating the light bulb; despite facing numerous setbacks, his careful planning and willingness to take risks allowed him to learn from his errors. In summary, success is not merely the outcome of risk-taking or meticulous planning, but rather the result of a thoughtful and adaptable strategy that integrates aspects of both."
329;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"People should sometimes do things, even though they don't enjoy it. This is basic part of the lives. There may be small or big things, but at last people should accept them, because most of them is about responsibilities. Moreover, sometimes by doing things helps the people learn about live. In this essay, the reasons for why I agree that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing will be explored. Firstly, most people's lives are filled with tasks that they don't enjoy doing.In personal live, we have some responsibilities towards to other people, there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities. For instance, housework is very difficult for me, although my husband helps me some of them, but it is my responsibility. I really don't like any of them, however I should do. Secondly,professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs. Nobody likes attending boring conferences, or working a person who isn't well in with anyone. I'm a research asistant at a university, and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn't good at human relationships, most of the asistans don't enjoy to talk with him about any situation, although we have to ask about his field. Thirdly, doing something which an individual doesn't enjoy can led to enjoyment. People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don't really want. For example, one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don't like. After insisting on some of our friends, we attended, and got really enjoyable time, we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month.Nobody has a life with a lot of fun; there are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone, but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual's live.";I firmly believe that there are times when individuals should engage in activities they don’t particularly enjoy. In our fast-paced and ever-changing world, being adaptable and willing to embrace new experiences—even those that aren't immediately pleasurable—is crucial. One of the main reasons for this is the opportunity for personal growth and development. Venturing outside our comfort zones allows us to build resilience, acquire new skills, and gain valuable insights.Take, for example, students who may dread public speaking. Yet, it is an essential skill for career success. By challenging themselves to participate in debates, presentations, or speeches, they can conquer their fears and become more confident communicators. Similarly, athletes might not relish the tough training sessions, but such practices are vital for developing endurance and reaching their goals.Additionally, engaging in unpleasant tasks can lead to practical advantages. Activities like paying bills, visiting the dentist, or doing household chores might not be enjoyable, yet they play a significant role in maintaining a comfortable and healthy lifestyle. By completing these necessary tasks, individuals can secure their financial stability, physical health, and a tidy home environment.In summary, although it's tempting to focus solely on activities that provide immediate joy, it’s important to occasionally step outside our comfort zones and tackle tasks we might not enjoy. Doing so enables us to develop new skills, cultivate resilience, and reach our objectives. Ultimately, the advantages of undertaking activities we don’t particularly like far surpass the brief discomfort, and this practice plays a vital role in both personal and professional growth.
330;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homesÊ;The city where I was born used to be of a great antique beauty, which was surrounded with by lots of ancient style buildings. Unfortunately, the unstoppable trend of urbanization makes me only appreciate parts of those classic buildings in the pictures or in museums. In order to prevent the disappearance of the historic buildings, some citizens suggest the government to spend money on historic buildings. As far as I am concerned, we should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings, letting next generations still have a chance to look at them. Here are some reasons and examples to illustrate my viewpoint. Historic buildings have intrinsic values, because they are significant symbols of a city. Old buildings are reminders of a city's culture and complexity. By seeing historic buildings -- whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic, people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area. For example, when somebody mentions Beijing, China's capital city, you will immediately have Capital Palace come to appear in your mind, because it is the most remarkable sign of the city, and also it is the inevitable history of Beijing, even the entire China. Depending on the study of Capital Palace, researchers have a comprehensive understanding of the history and the culture. Furthermore, historic buildings make our lives more colorful, provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds. The city is occupied with an abundance of modern houses and and high buildings which make it crowded, and no rooms for people to relax themselves. However, the warmth of the materials, the heart pine, marble, or the old brick, all those old buildings features call back of our inner peace. Lying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life's little annoyance and feel peaceful. Meanwhile, historic buildings can be a source of maintenance fees. There are many historic buildings, such as Beijing Place, Shanghai Artist Museum, they are all able to support themselves financially by charging tens of thousands of tourists. Our governments will be happy with those efficient consequences, and a majority of cities also can imitate this economical cycle. Overall, I believe that the city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity. However, the preservation of old buildings is a one-way street. There is no chance to renovate to save a history site once it's gone. This reality brings us to light the importance of locating and saving old buildings of historic significance. Therefore, government should spend money on preservation of old buildings.;I contest the idea that government spending on new buildings is more crucial than the preservation of historic and traditional structures. While new constructions can offer updated amenities and functionality, historic buildings possess immense cultural, social, and economic significance that cannot be reproduced.Maintaining historic buildings provides future generations with the opportunity to learn from and appreciate their heritage, offering insight into the historical context and evolution of society. These structures frequently serve as tourist attractions, generating income and bolstering local economies. Additionally, they create a sense of continuity and identity within communities, reinforcing ties to their history.Moreover, preserving traditional buildings plays a role in sustainable development. By renovating and reusing existing structures, we can reduce the demand for new materials and minimize waste, thereby lessening the environmental impact of construction. This practice aligns with sustainable development principles, emphasizing resource efficiency and pollution reduction.The cultural importance of historic buildings can also enhance community and social cohesion. Often hosting cultural events, exhibitions, and public gatherings, these sites help strengthen social ties and encourage cultural exchange. By investing in the preservation of these buildings, governments contribute to the social fabric of their communities, enriching the cultural landscape.In summary, while it is vital for a country to invest in new buildings, it is equally important for governments to dedicate resources to preserving historic and traditional structures. This not only protects cultural heritage but also supports sustainable development, community engagement, and economic vitality. A balanced approach that incorporates the need for modern infrastructure with the preservation of historical assets is key to fostering a harmonious and prosperous society.
331;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of the solutions do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;As young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own. But, the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one. Personally, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time.Living on your own is a huge financial commitment. At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job, so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself. So, I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income.Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them. Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life. Living together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents. Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents.While some critics may argue that, young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want. However, I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have. It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night, smoke or do drugs. In a nutshell, I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own. It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs. Thus, to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life, to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path, it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time.;The discussion surrounding the appropriate time for young adults to gain independence from their parents has ignited lively debate. While some young adults eagerly seek independence, others prefer to continue living with their families for an extended period. I believe that remaining with family for longer is a more advantageous choice.Firstly, living at home provides young adults with financial security. The expenses associated with independent living can be daunting, particularly for those who have just entered the workforce or are still pursuing their studies. By residing with their parents, young adults can benefit from their financial support, alleviating costs such as rent, groceries, and utilities. For example, a friend of mine moved out shortly after graduation and found himself juggling multiple part-time jobs to make ends meet, while his sibling, who stayed home, was able to concentrate on career growth without the financial strain.Secondly, cohabitating with family allows young adults to cultivate essential life skills with their parents’ guidance. Parents can offer invaluable advice and support, aiding their children in navigating the complexities of adulthood, like budgeting, cooking, and managing their time effectively. For instance, a young adult living with their parents can learn how to prepare healthy meals and maintain a balanced diet, rather than relying on takeout or convenience foods.In conclusion, while achieving independence is a crucial milestone in adulthood, living with family for a longer duration presents various benefits, including financial stability and the chance to acquire vital life skills. Instead of hastily pursuing independence, young adults should weigh the advantages of staying with their families and fully leverage this nurturing environment.
332;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development.;Nowadays, the Earth has become like a small village. In the course of the last hundred years, the way majority of people communicate with each other has been altered significantly because of technology. But there are vast amount of disputes whether it is positive or negative. From my point of view, this development was a very positive one in spite of its some drawbacks.To begin with, nowadays, to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever. Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present, it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete. By means of some software such as Skype, MSN, Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want. For example, in earlier times, people didn't leave for faraway places, because they could easily get lost. This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive.Further, by means of some communication tools, it has become very easy to make new friends. According to statistics, 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet. In this sense, Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends.However, the other side of the coin is that, by communicating via Internet or phone, we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully, because during such conversations, some of our words can make a completely different sense. As a result, the rate of divorces is increasing day by day. By way of conclusion, I once again restate my position that the development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people very positively by making it easier and more comfortable.;The emergence of technology has transformed the way individuals engage with one another, significantly altering the nature of relationships. On one hand, technology facilitates connections that transcend geographical barriers, broadening the possibilities for forming relationships. Social media, online forums, and messaging applications allow people to connect with others who share similar passions and interests. As a result, diverse and global communities have formed, creating a sense of belonging and connection.Conversely, technology has faced criticism for its detrimental effects on relationships. The rise of social media has led to a surge in superficial ties, where individuals often showcase an idealized version of themselves, masking their true selves behind a facade. This situation can contribute to feelings of isolation and disconnection, as people often replace meaningful, in-person interactions with online engagements. Additionally, the constant influx of notifications and information fosters a culture of distraction, making it difficult to engage in profound and meaningful discussions.In my view, the influence of technology on relationships is both positive and negative. It has certainly opened new pathways for connection and community, yet it also presents significant challenges to the depth and intimacy of our interactions. Ultimately, it is essential for individuals to utilize technology in ways that enrich and enhance their relationships, rather than diminish them. By remaining mindful of our online engagements and actively nurturing our offline connections, we can ensure that technology serves as a means to strengthen our relationships, not undermine them.
333;With the increasing use and development of new technology, many machines are now able to do the work which people used to perform. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?;The issue of whether using of machine are bring many advantages to society is of great concern to many people. In my opinion, although using machines have many benefits, we cannot ignore its negative effects.It is undoubted that machines can bring many benefits. For one thing, machines are more effective than human. Not like human, machines do not need rest, which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes. For another, using machines can save company's money. Because machines never ask for salary, over-time pay or pension, so employers do not need to spend money on employee's welfare. The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working. However, the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people. To start with, because of extensive of using machines, many people loss their job. Especially in large population countries, high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability. Apart from this, using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation. For example, nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing. But they did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware. As you can imagine, if thousands of families use dish-washing machines, how many water and how much electricity will be wasted!In conclusion, although we cannot deny machines are play a vital role in people living and working, problems posed by machines should draws more attentions as well.;The rising adoption and advancement of technology have significantly transformed the nature of work. Many machines are now able to take on tasks that were once carried out by humans, a trend that brings both benefits and drawbacks.On the positive side, the benefits of this development are plentiful. For example, machines can operate continuously without fatigue, leading to enhanced productivity and efficiency. They also perform tasks with a high level of precision, which minimizes the chances of errors. Furthermore, machines can function in dangerous environments, decreasing the risk of injury for human workers. Additionally, utilizing machines often results in cost reductions, as they can execute tasks more affordably than human labor.Conversely, there are notable disadvantages to consider. A primary concern is the potential for job losses, as machines increasingly replace human workers. This shift can result in unemployment and economic instability. Moreover, heavy reliance on technology may lead to a decline in human skill sets, as individuals become less practiced in tasks now handled by machines. There is also the risk of machine malfunctions or breakdowns, which can cause disruptions in production and other challenges.In summary, while the trend of machines taking over human jobs offers numerous advantages, it also presents significant challenges. Increased productivity and efficiency must be weighed against potential threats to employment and skill development. Therefore, it is crucial to find a balance between employing technology and maintaining human involvement to ensure that the advantages of innovation are enjoyed while mitigating its negative effects. By doing so, we can leverage technology to enhance our lives while safeguarding the interests of workers and the economy.
334;In the last 20 years there have been significant developments in the field of information technology (IT), for example, the World Wide Web and communication by email. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;Decade after decade, every day, scientists discover magnificent devices in the field of IT, such as interactive boards, multicore computers and laptops, tablets, which have an incredible resolution and also mobile phones, which have the power of a computer. World Wide Web and communication via email are some of the positive sides of information technology, however, there are some negative aspects.Firstly, connecting people by email is easy and fast. In addition, World Wide Web offers humanity to access to information, which they want to know for less than 10 seconds. These are two of the benefits, why IT is useful.Besides, nowadays technology is entering into our society really quick and scientists develop robots, which help people cope with their problems or just invent coffee machines, engines with integrated computers and etc. For example, before centeries, there were not washing machines, which clean your clothes, while a person do another job.Secondly, there are some drawbacks about this issue. Scientists believe that one day people will face their developments, for instance robots, and they will not succeed to control them. All this inventions will try to take control of the Earth.In conclusion, I agree that IT discoveries are likely to have more disadvantages than benefits and people should know how to use their developments properly.;The information technology (IT) sector has experienced remarkable growth over the past 20 years, with breakthroughs such as the World Wide Web and email transforming our daily lives and work environments. Despite this progress, there is growing apprehension that future IT advancements may yield more adverse effects than benefits. While I acknowledge the risks associated with these advancements, I only partially concur with this perspective.On one side, it is indeed accurate that an overdependence on IT can result in detrimental outcomes, including social isolation, cyberbullying, and reduced attention spans. Additionally, the escalating collection and storage of personal data online poses serious concerns regarding privacy and security. The automation of jobs, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics, may also lead to substantial unemployment, intensifying social and economic disparities.Conversely, I am convinced that the advantages of upcoming IT innovations will surpass the disadvantages. For example, emerging technologies such as telemedicine and online education platforms have the potential to enhance healthcare accessibility and educational opportunities, especially in remote and underserved communities. Moreover, IT innovations can promote global connectivity, encourage cultural exchanges, and support international collaboration, ultimately contributing to a more cohesive and interconnected world.In summary, while it is crucial to recognize the potential negative consequences of future IT developments, I do not fully agree that these will overshadow the positive effects. By acknowledging the risks and taking proactive steps to address them, we can leverage the power of IT to foster a better, more equitable, and more sustainable future for everyone.
335;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, celebrities appear to become a spotlight of the mass media. Almost half of the news coverage on television and the Internet is devoted to the celebrity gossip. Not surprisingly, many people are worried that this attention to the famous people has an impact on them, especially on their children. This essay will compare both negative and positive consequences of this effect on infants.Fame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols. Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively. This means that celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace. Therefore, children may see that this behavior is inexcusable.On the other hand, too much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions. As recent surveys showed, inspired by the fame and wealth, children now prefer more to become an actor/actress or a sports star than it was in the past. Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable. This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media, but from the basis of their own interests.In conclusion, parents should be more worried about their children's attitudes to the 'cult of celebrity'. They should teach their children how to distinguish shortcoming stars from truly talented ones and to put right priorities in life.;The discussion surrounding the impact of celebrity media coverage on children has ignited a vigorous debate in recent years. I largely concur that the excessive focus on celebrities can adversely affect young minds.On one side of the argument, media portrayals of celebrities often foster unrealistic standards and encourage materialism among children. The relentless stream of images and narratives highlighting the extravagant lifestyles of the famous may lead young people to equate fame and fortune with success. This mindset can detract from the importance of values like education, diligence, and social responsibility. Additionally, the objectification of celebrities may glorify superficial traits, such as physical attractiveness, at the expense of deeper qualities like compassion and empathy.Conversely, some argue that celebrity media can positively influence children. Many celebrities leverage their visibility to advocate for social and environmental causes, which can motivate children to engage in charitable efforts. Moreover, the accomplishments of certain celebrities may inspire kids to pursue their dreams with determination. Nonetheless, I maintain that these positive aspects are often eclipsed by the detrimental effects of celebrity culture.In summary, while there might be some advantages to celebrity media coverage, I strongly believe that the negative consequences far exceed the positives. Parents and guardians should be vigilant about the media their children consume and work to limit excessive exposure to celebrity culture. By fostering a more balanced and realistic worldview, we can help nurture a healthy and optimistic perspective in children.
336;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;"Recently, there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication. Indeed, mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages, bringing convenience and entertainment into our life. However, as far as I am concerned, I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems.In the first place, spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life. In the first place, as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones, they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children.Furthermore, there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as ""Iron man"". In those games, children are rewarded for being more violent, and this violence is repeated again and again. For instance, many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot, which many lead to increased aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviours. Therefore, the hardship of communication may be developed.However, other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint. With rapid development of the internet, people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet. For instance, as lots of chatting apps available online such as ""Weichat"", people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication. Therefore, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication.After having considered all the problems that I have discussed above, we can finally draw a conclusion that although mobile phones brings convenience of communication, they also contribute to some social problems.";The rise of mobile phones has fundamentally changed the way people communicate, sparking a discussion about their effects on social interaction. While some believe mobile phones undermine social engagement, I disagree with this perspective. I contend that while mobile phones have altered the way we connect, they have not obliterated the essence of social interaction.On one hand, excessive use of mobile phones can lead to feelings of isolation. Many individuals become preoccupied with their devices—texting, browsing, or gaming—instead of interacting with those immediately around them. This can result in fewer face-to-face interactions, which are crucial for nurturing and sustaining meaningful relationships. Additionally, the constant urge to remain connected often breeds dependency, causing people to overlook their environment and the individuals within it.Conversely, mobile phones have also introduced new avenues for social interaction that were previously inconceivable. Social media, messaging platforms, and video conferencing have made it possible to maintain relationships with friends, family, and colleagues across vast distances. Mobile technology has also empowered the formation of communities and social movements, enabling individuals to organize, advocate, and raise awareness about pressing social issues. Furthermore, mobile phones serve as a vital means of communication for those with disabilities or individuals residing in isolated regions, enhancing their inclusion in society.In summary, while mobile phones can have detrimental effects on social interaction, they have simultaneously created new opportunities for connection and community engagement. Rather than dismantling social interaction, mobile devices have transformed it, fostering greater diversity, accessibility, and reach. By using mobile phones judiciously and balancing digital communication with in-person engagement, we can tap into their potential to enrich our social experiences.
337;Modern forms of communication such as email and messaging have reduced the amount of time people spend seeing their friends. This has had a negative effect on their social lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Undoubtedly, the movement of modern forms of communication has changed better, which help people to interact to others, such as email and messaging without limitation time. I totally agree that using of these soft devices have cut much of time people need to see with their relatives. However, it is had some demerits on their social lives.Mentioned to societies life style, they constantly use these kinds of electronic letter for making fellowship or just continuing theirs what they already had. Obviousness, there are other ways like social media that they could to use it for meeting theirs buddies such as Twitter and Facebook, also make the communication become feasible and limitless of time.Another perspective, using of these facilities has influenced netizens to keep themselves becoming unsociable. It caused they were swept away by virtual atmosphere, so they do not do much social live interactions with others. The consequence of this case made some people become geek, as too much of using email and messaging, without direct contacts. However, people have had own minded to keep connection with their friends as a good relationship, meet them and talk by face to face directly.In conclusion, I admittedly and strongly agree that the merits of email and messaging have reduced amount of ours time to communicate to. Besides, we need to make sure for the real gathering with our colleague.;The rise of contemporary communication methods, like email and messaging, has transformed the way individuals connect with one another. While some people contend that these technologies have diminished the time spent with friends, leading to detrimental effects on social lives, I have a more nuanced view of this claim.On one hand, it's clear that email and messaging allow individuals to keep in touch seamlessly without the need for in-person meetings. This shift can decrease face-to-face interactions, which are crucial for fostering strong social ties. Additionally, relying too heavily on digital communication might contribute to feelings of isolation, as individuals might replace meaningful in-person interactions with virtual conversations.Conversely, modern communication tools can help people stay connected with friends who live far away or have hectic lifestyles, making it easier to sustain relationships that might otherwise dwindle due to distance or time constraints. Furthermore, these technologies have created new opportunities for social engagement, such as online communities and forums, where individuals can meet others with shared interests.In summary, while it’s true that modern communication methods may reduce the frequency of in-person encounters with friends, I believe that the negative aspects of this trend are counterbalanced by the many advantages these technologies provide. Striking a balance between digital interaction and face-to-face meetings is crucial for maintaining a healthy and rewarding social life. By being conscious of our communication patterns and prioritizing regular in-person gatherings with friends, we can enjoy the benefits of modern communication while also nurturing our social connections.
338;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Other believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.;"It is undeniable that children have an innocent mind, and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life. Some people think that it is better to make them competitive, while other believes to make them co-operative. Both these factors have their own values, and have been discussed in detail below:Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently. This factor initially arises from the school, where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system, and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks. This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead, but will also restrict them in many ways. For example, MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work, and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team.However, those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead. Although, they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do, but they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team.In my opinion, though competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level, but it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run; while on the contrary, co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team.To conclude, I would say that people should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life.";The discussion on whether children should be encouraged to compete or collaborate has ignited passionate debates among parents, educators, and experts alike. Some advocate for fostering a competitive spirit in children, emphasizing its importance, while others argue that instilling a sense of cooperation is more advantageous for their development.Proponents of competition highlight its many benefits. They believe that competition can inspire children to strive for excellence, challenge their boundaries, and cultivate resilience in the face of adversity. It can also prepare them for the realities of adulthood, where challenges and setbacks are inevitable. Moreover, competitive settings can help children acquire essential life skills such as time management, strategic thinking, and problem-solving.Conversely, those in favor of cooperation suggest that learning to work together can yield significant long-term benefits, ultimately shaping more capable adults. When children collaborate towards a shared goal, they develop crucial social skills such as communication, empathy, and teamwork. Cooperative efforts foster a sense of community and mutual support, leading to stronger relationships and a heightened sense of social responsibility. Additionally, cooperative environments encourage children to hone their problem-solving abilities as they exchange ideas, leverage each other's strengths, and constructively resolve conflicts.In the end, striking a balance between competition and cooperation may be the most effective strategy. By teaching children to engage in healthy, respectful competition while also highlighting the importance of teamwork and collaboration, we can equip them with a diverse skill set that will benefit them throughout their lives. This balanced approach aims to nurture a generation of individuals who are not only ambitious but also adept at working together to achieve great results.
339;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development?;Nowadays, the variety of communication systems used widely. As technology develops, it has negative influences in many respects. However, I strongly agree with that the technology has large positive effects on relationships between people. The main advantage is that technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely. While public use the Internet or smart phone to share information to each other at different positions. Instead of using letters, technology advanced not only gives us more spare time but also convenient and efficient. More, even if family members who are in different countries, they also can use the Internet to connect each others, especially though the images or videos, they can feel close. Furthermore, technology is also essential for students, live in remote districts, shared the valuable natural resources with friends. Another issue is that in the ever-accelerated updating of science and technology, technology provides opportunities for people to establish the social network. In the past, people might have had pen friends in other countries, but now, thanks to the social networking websites, people can easily to find someone who has similar interests. Also, they can connect with friends who have been out of touch for a long time by using the Internet. In this way, technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships. In conclusion, I agree with that the technology has more optimal effects on people's interaction, because it helps ordinary people to make new friends and to maintain relationships.;The rise of technology has transformed how individuals communicate, profoundly affecting the nature of relationships. With the proliferation of social media, online platforms, and messaging applications, traditional face-to-face interactions have increasingly shifted toward digital exchanges. On one hand, technology facilitates connections across geographical barriers, promoting global friendships and networks. Social media also allows people to rekindle old friendships, thereby enhancing existing relationships.Conversely, an over-dependence on technology has contributed to a decline in deep, meaningful connections. Online interactions often lack the emotional closeness and empathy found in person, resulting in more superficial relationships. Additionally, the quest for approval through likes and comments can foster unrealistic expectations and encourage narcissistic tendencies. The convenience of digital communication may also lead to social isolation, as individuals may substitute online interactions for genuine, real-world connections.In summary, technology's influence on relationships presents both advantages and drawbacks. While it creates new opportunities for connection, it also endangers the quality and depth of those relationships. Striking a balance between the benefits of technology and the need for personal interaction is essential. By being conscious of our technology use and actively seeking meaningful, face-to-face engagements, we can leverage technology to enhance our relationships, rather than allowing it to diminish them. This approach ensures that technology complements rather than replaces the richness and intimacy of human connection.
340;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;With the development of technology, whether or not it is still necessary to protect the traditional skills and lifestyles leads to a drastic controversy which is becoming a public concern, especially considering the significant impact taken by technology. As far as I am concerned, the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to.Traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society, in terms of healthcare, environmental protection and cultural inherit. Although technology takes convenience to humankind, it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life, like sedentary lifestyle. Instead, traditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance. Meanwhile, due to the fact that traditional skills rely little on fossil energy, it is more environmentally-friendly, which should be promoted to reduce the threat of climate change. Furthermore those tradition-related things convey traditional culture and values. These are important foundation of modern civilization. Protection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems.Some people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes. In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance, it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions. Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life, so as to make people to realize the value of them.All in all, protection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently, but also contributes to the next generation.;"The rise of technology has undeniably reshaped the essence of contemporary society, bringing forth remarkable innovations and conveniences. Yet, this swift evolution has also raised alarms about the decline of traditional skills and lifestyles. While some may contend that maintaining these outdated practices is futile, I believe that efforts to preserve them are far from pointless.On one hand, advancements in technology have made numerous traditional skills seem obsolete, turning them into relics of the past. For example, the widespread use of calculators and computers has significantly reduced the need for manual calculations and handwriting. Additionally, the speed and efficiency of modern technology have made many traditional jobs, such as artisanal crafts and trades, less viable in today's competitive market.Conversely, traditional skills and lifestyles carry immense cultural and historical significance. They are often deeply intertwined with a community's identity and provide a vital connection to their history. Maintaining these skills not only promotes cultural diversity but also enhances community bonds and social unity. Moreover, traditional practices like folk medicine and organic farming can offer invaluable insights and alternatives to contemporary technological solutions.Instead of allowing traditional skills to fade away, it is crucial to discover ways to adapt and blend them with modern technology. This can be accomplished through educational initiatives and cultural programs that highlight the importance of these practices, as well as efforts that encourage their evolution within a modern framework. By doing this, we can ensure that the knowledge and heritage of the past continue to enrich our lives today and in the future. In summary, while technology has significantly influenced our lives, striving to preserve traditional skills and ways of living is not only worthwhile but vital; achieving a balance between innovation and preservation is essential."
341;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to be co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend, which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them, and also be able to teach them teamwork skill. However, some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative, both the values have its arguments.A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers, and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents, to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system. Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently, but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others. Being competitive leads them to success, but could also restrict them in many ways. For example, it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project.On the other hand, cooperation is also an essential quality for children, no matter in school activities or in communities. Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others, which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team. After all, in society, there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself. For example, famous singers or movie stars, despite of their talent to make them successful, there are always a team to manage works or deal with things.In my point of view, though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success, but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work. To sum up, I would say that schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community.;The ongoing debate about whether to prioritize competition or cooperation in children has generated significant discussion. Some argue that encouraging competition is vital for children's growth, asserting that it motivates them to work harder, pursue excellence, and build resilience when faced with setbacks. This approach, they claim, equips kids for real-world challenges, where competition is a common reality. Additionally, competition can boost children's self-esteem and drive, as it teaches them to set and achieve goals.Conversely, others argue that fostering cooperation in children offers greater long-term benefits. They believe that teamwork, empathy, and social skills cultivated through cooperation are essential for forming strong relationships and achieving shared success. When children learn to collaborate on a common goal, they acquire key life skills such as communication, problem-solving, and conflict resolution. Cooperation also nurtures a sense of community and support, paving the way for more harmonious and productive adult relationships.In my view, although competition can serve as a motivating factor, I believe that instilling a sense of cooperation is more crucial. In today's interconnected society, the capacity to collaborate and build strong relationships is essential for success. Furthermore, cooperation encourages social responsibility and empathy, both of which are vital for fostering a compassionate and equitable society. By promoting cooperation, we can cultivate a generation of adults who are not only driven and accomplished but also considerate and dedicated to the well-being of others. Ultimately, finding a balance between competition and cooperation is important, but I strongly advocate for prioritizing cooperation in childhood development.
342;Some people think that advertising give more harms than good to our society. Other refute this. Discuss both views and give your opinion;On these days, with the assistance of advertisement, people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement. Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages, I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives.On the one hand, it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell. In addition to this, all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods. For example, some kinds of shampoo, namely Sunsilk, Clear, Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits. However, the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement. On the other hand, it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers, writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands. Moreover, advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers. Take Coca cola for an example, this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising. No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world. Last but not least, online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost, convenience and easily observing.To sum up, everything has its own gains and losses and advertisement is not an exception. From my point of view, advertising will be better if producers and advertisers are more honest in producing advertisements to give people the general view on one product.;"The influence of advertising on society has sparked considerable debate, with some arguing that its effects are largely detrimental, while others take an opposing view. Critics contend that advertising can be deceptive and manipulative, creating unrealistic expectations and fostering consumerism that leads to needless spending and waste. Additionally, advertising may reinforce negative stereotypes and exacerbate social inequalities; for example, certain advertisements can objectify women or depict specific racial groups in a negative light, thus contributing to a culture of discrimination and bias.Conversely, proponents of advertising highlight its many advantages. It provides consumers with information about new products and services, enabling them to make informed purchasing decisions. Advertising also plays a crucial role in sustaining the media and entertainment sectors, which in turn benefit the public by producing engaging and informative content. Furthermore, advertising can raise awareness of important social issues, such as environmental protection and public health. For instance, some companies allocate their advertising resources to promote recycling and sustainability initiatives, encouraging consumers to adopt greener practices.In my view, although advertising does have negative aspects, its overall benefits outweigh the drawbacks. When executed responsibly, advertising can serve as a powerful instrument for social good and economic progress. It is imperative for advertisers to communicate truthfully and respectfully, steering clear of manipulation and stereotypes. Ultimately, consumers hold the responsibility to critically assess the advertisements they encounter and make informed choices regarding the products and services they endorse. By advocating for responsible advertising practices, we can leverage the power of advertising to foster a more informed, sustainable, and equitable society."
343;Some modern artists receive huge sums of money for the things they create, while other struggle to survive. Government should take steps to resolve this unfair situation. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"The amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair. In a field of art, modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money. Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation, critics against such view. I agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in.Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work. It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector. Also, the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent. For example, a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production. On the other hand, modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do, such making impossible become possible. Pieter Padang, Minion creator, has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric ""I swear"" become ""underwear"" when the Minion sing in Despicable Me. He granted huge sums for such idea.Striking contrast, labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day. In any case, a musician playing ""I swear"" several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation. Moreover, government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it, art value is about taste.Having said that the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art, while the term of struggle might different with other field of job. I agree that government cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar because art price is about taste.";The art world has historically faced issues of inequality, with some artists earning significant amounts for their work while others struggle to survive. The question of whether the government should step in to address this disparity is a nuanced one. I believe that the government should indeed take measures to alleviate this unfair situation, albeit with caution.On one hand, the government has a responsibility to support the arts and ensure that talented individuals can sustain themselves through their creative endeavors. By providing financial assistance and resources to struggling artists, it’s feasible to foster a more equitable environment and create opportunities for those who might otherwise go unnoticed. This support could involve initiatives like grants, subsidies, and training programs to help artists enhance their abilities and promote their work.Conversely, it’s crucial to acknowledge that the art market operates on the principles of supply and demand, and government intervention can sometimes yield unforeseen repercussions. Should the government begin to dictate which forms of art merit funding, it risks stifling creativity and leading to a uniformity of artistic expression. Additionally, it can be challenging for the government to accurately identify which artists are genuinely talented and deserving of assistance.In summary, while I believe the government should play a role in supporting the arts, it’s vital to be discerning about the manner in which this support is implemented. Instead of attempting to control the market or providing blanket funding, the focus should be on creating opportunities and resources for artists to refine their skills and showcase their work. By adopting a thoughtful and targeted approach, we can work toward a more equitable and vibrant art community.
344;People tend to work longer hours nowadays. Working long hours has a negative effect on themselves, their families and the society, so working hours should be restricted. Do you agree or disagree?;"Working longer hours is becoming prevalent in these days. There is a saying in my native village, ""Health is Wealth"". I believe many of people including me are not really considering the importance of health. The need for increased working hours might be because of enhanced competitive environment and desire to acquire much money and promotion. However, people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life. In my opinion, a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours. First of all, many of us would agree to the fact that people; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health. By working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick. Moreover, they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons. The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life.Secondly, these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign. As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities. For instance, I would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years. Recently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries. He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him.To conclude this, I would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies. This will help in uplift of society, and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person.";The idea that people are working longer hours today has ignited a vigorous discussion about the consequences of extended work periods on individuals, their families, and society at large. I am firmly convinced that there should be limitations on working hours due to the multitude of adverse effects associated with prolonged work.Long working hours can seriously harm both physical and mental health. Extended workdays often lead to increased stress, fatigue, and an elevated risk of chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease. Moreover, excessive hours can result in burnout, which diminishes productivity and job satisfaction. When people are compelled to work long hours, they frequently sacrifice personal time, disrupting their work-life balance.The impact of long working hours extends to families as well. When parents are tied up with work for extended periods, they have less time to spend with their children, which can weaken family bonds and diminish parental involvement. This lack of connection can adversely affect the emotional and psychological growth of children. Additionally, the strain on family dynamics may lead to marital issues and even divorce.At a societal level, the ramifications of long working hours are equally significant. When individuals are preoccupied with work, they often have less opportunity to participate in community activities, which can erode social connections and community engagement. The negative implications on health can further strain the healthcare system, leading to considerable economic repercussions.In summary, the harmful effects of extended working hours on individuals, families, and society at large are clear and compelling. Therefore, I strongly advocate for regulating working hours to foster a healthier work-life balance, safeguard family relationships, and preserve social cohesion. By setting limits on work hours, we can pave the way for a more equitable and sustainable society.
345;A successful person is one who has earned a lot of money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;It's such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money, especially in nowadays society. Each individual visualize success differently. Still, my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income.Money is undeniably pivotal, but ways of earning it is also various. A person's great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself. Nevertheless, a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working, dedication and passion. Whether it is a personal or a social achievement, that man is laudable.More importantly, the more beneficial for the society his achievement is, the more successful he is considered. For instance, Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention's productivity is countless useful for mankind. On the other hand, the fact of knowing a man's utilization of his money remains in the dark. Therefore, judging a person by his income is difficult, especially in the success aspect.In conclusion, using only money as a scale to measure a man's success is impossible despite the fact that it is the essential in basic needs. Yet, it is the common scene that a man can be publicly considered successful when his achievements, which can only accomplished by passion, dedication and ethics, are helpful not only for himself.;The idea that a truly successful person is defined solely by their financial wealth is a widespread misunderstanding. While having financial security is certainly important, it's not the only factor that defines success. Personally, I find that I can only agree with this viewpoint to an extent.On one side, accumulating wealth can offer comfort, security, and freedom, along with the chance to pursue personal passions and contribute positively to society. Many accomplished entrepreneurs, artists, and philanthropists have realized their ambitions through financial success, which has allowed them to make significant impacts in their respective fields.Conversely, there are countless examples of individuals who achieve success without prioritizing financial gain. Nobel Prize winners, human rights advocates, and volunteers often dedicate their lives to creating change, measuring their success by the positive effects they have on others and the fulfillment they find in their efforts.Furthermore, placing too much emphasis on financial achievement can lead to an imbalanced and unfulfilling life. Numerous wealthy individuals have sacrificed their relationships, health, and overall well-being in the process of accumulating riches. In contrast, those who focus on personal development, nurturing meaningful relationships, and making societal contributions often report greater happiness and satisfaction.In summary, while substantial financial earnings can contribute to success, they are not the sole indicator. A truly successful person achieves a balance among financial stability, personal fulfillment, and making a positive difference in the world. Ultimately, success is a complex and multifaceted concept that cannot be reduced to any single criterion, such as wealth.
346;Question: Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which there are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowdays, people's choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television, street, magazine etc. This argument may be true that people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life. For example, in most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs.In addition, products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought. A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society. And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it.However, buying habit is a very personal things for individuals, the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy, sometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption. It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income. Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase. On the other hand, children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not, since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary.In my opinion, I think buying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements. But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising. So it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company (for example, toys company) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need.;The idea that high sales of popular consumer products are more influenced by advertising than by actual societal needs has gained considerable attention in recent years. I largely agree that advertising plays a crucial role in shaping consumer choices, frequently eclipsing the true requirements of society.On one hand, advertising has become an essential instrument for businesses to raise awareness and influence consumer preferences. Through innovative marketing strategies and eye-catching visuals, advertisers can cultivate a perceived necessity for a product, often resulting in increased sales. For example, the growth of luxury fashion brands can be traced back to successful advertising campaigns that create an image of exclusivity and status, rather than addressing a real need for practical clothing.Conversely, it can be argued that some consumer products genuinely address societal needs, offering solutions to significant problems or enhancing quality of life. For instance, the demand for healthcare products or energy-efficient appliances stems from a legitimate need for well-being and sustainability. However, these examples are often overshadowed by the overwhelming impact of advertising-driven sales that are more motivated by desire than necessity.In conclusion, while it is true that some consumer products meet actual societal needs, I believe that advertising wields considerable influence over the sales of popular goods. The manipulation of consumer preferences through strategic advertising frequently leads to a disconnect between what is marketed and the real needs of society. As consumers, it is crucial to critically assess our purchasing choices and differentiate between authentic needs and artificially generated desires.
347;Some people think that by paying taxes they made enough contribution to their society. TO what extent do you agree or disagree? ;Paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country. Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that. Personally, I tend to disagree with this view.To start with, all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government, as it is the most important source of government's revenue, which is mainly used to serve all citizens. For example, a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability, so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment. The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers. Although these workers do not produce profit directly, what they do is for the well-being of the whole society.However, I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax. As we know, there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others. It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, but such financial help is usually far from enough. In such case, aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support. Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force. There are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited. So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department.In conclusion, it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government. Other than that, they have other critical obligations to take, in order to make our society function in an ordered way.;The idea that paying taxes is a sufficient way to contribute to society is a subject of ongoing debate. While taxes are essential for funding public goods and services, as well as developing infrastructure, some people feel that fulfilling this financial duty is enough to meet their social responsibilities. However, I largely disagree with this viewpoint.On the one hand, paying taxes is undeniably a vital civic responsibility. Tax revenues fund crucial public services like healthcare, education, and national defense, which are essential for the well-being and safety of citizens. Additionally, taxes help support social welfare programs that work to reduce poverty and inequality. In this light, contributing to the tax system can be viewed as a valid form of societal involvement.On the other hand, confining one’s contribution to society solely to tax payments presents a limited and inadequate perspective. True societal contribution encompasses a variety of actions beyond financial commitments, such as volunteering, community engagement, environmental stewardship, and advocacy for social issues. These efforts not only supplement government initiatives but also nurture a sense of community and solidarity. Moreover, direct involvement in local matters can lead to more effective solutions tailored to the specific needs of the community.In conclusion, although paying taxes is a crucial contribution to society, it should not be regarded as the only way to give back. A more comprehensive view of societal contribution includes active involvement in community activities, volunteering, and championing social and environmental issues. Therefore, individuals should expand their contributions beyond taxes to engage in other meaningful actions that enhance their communities and society as a whole. By doing so, they can make a more significant and lasting difference.
348;School should teach children the academic subje cts which have a close relationship with their future careers, so other subjects like music and sports are not important. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"People have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school. Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school, I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program.Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics, physics because these subject are necessary for students' future. This is understandable when labor market now has high competition; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification. In addition, the unemployment rate is always high, so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job. Although those above reasons are acceptable, I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job. Firstly, studying music, art or sports is also very important to students. This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them. Secondly, to get a job in labor market, not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork, presentation. For instance, through taking part in a sport, students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills. Therefore, these subjects might fulfil the students' ability. Finally, children's future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school, it is the result of their efforts and capacity.In conclusion, although the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children, it seem to me that the effects of learning music, sports are profound.";The debate over whether schools should focus primarily on academic subjects that align closely with future careers, while sidelining areas such as music and sports, is an ongoing discussion. Although I see the rationale behind this viewpoint, I strongly contend that music and sports hold significant value.On one side, it's undeniable that certain academic subjects like mathematics, science, and technology are essential for many professional paths. Educating students in these areas lays a strong foundation for their future careers. However, this does not suggest that disciplines like music and sports are unimportant. In fact, these fields provide a wealth of advantages, such as promoting creativity, teamwork, and physical health.Additionally, music and sports significantly contribute to a child’s overall development, enhancing their social, emotional, and cognitive abilities. For example, engaging in sports can instill crucial life skills like discipline, perseverance, and effective communication. Likewise, music education can boost cognitive functions, including memory and spatial-temporal capabilities. By incorporating these subjects into the curriculum, schools can offer a more comprehensive education that prepares students for diverse career paths and life experiences.Moreover, an excessive focus on career-oriented subjects may lead to a limited and utilitarian perspective on education, overlooking the importance of personal growth and enjoyment. Schools should aim to deliver a balanced education that allows students to pursue their interests and talents across various domains. This approach will enable students to acquire a wider array of skills, making them more flexible and better prepared to thrive in a constantly evolving world.In summary, while it's important to prioritize academic subjects linked to future careers, I firmly believe that music and sports are equally crucial for a student's overall development. Schools should endeavor to provide a well-rounded education, encouraging students to explore their passions across different fields, ultimately equipping them for a richer and more successful life.
349;Some people believe that information available in the internet will end the era of newspapers and magazines. Do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion and examples.;Digital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe. With this advancement, newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence. Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media. But many other still thinks they are going to stay. I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time. I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news.A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis. This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly. For example, when the aircraft MH 370 went missing, everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident. The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth. In such situations, newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media. Instead of waiting for next publication, people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two. This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines.People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research, satisfy interest, etc. For example, one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War. It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at. But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details. This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines.To conclude, the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider for valid reasons. Though considering the current infrastructure and mindset of people, paper media will continue for another few years.;The emergence of the internet has significantly transformed how people access information, with many suggesting that online content will ultimately supplant traditional newspapers and magazines. While I appreciate this viewpoint, I respectfully disagree with the idea that the internet will completely eliminate print media.On one side, it's clear that the internet has facilitated easier access to information from virtually anywhere at any time. Online news outlets and blogs have gained immense popularity, delivering timely and diverse content that can be easily shared and accessed. This shift has resulted in a noticeable decline in the circulation and readership of traditional print publications. Nonetheless, I assert that print media retains a distinct value that online formats simply cannot replicate.For example, many individuals still enjoy the tactile sensation of handling a physical newspaper or magazine, along with the in-depth analyses and feature articles that these publications commonly offer. Additionally, print media often conveys a sense of reliability and credibility that isn’t always present in online sources. Newspapers and magazines also curate their content, presenting a selection of stories that can be more engaging and easier to navigate compared to the overwhelming amount of information found online.In summary, although the internet has certainly altered our information consumption habits, I do not believe it will entirely replace newspapers and magazines. Rather, I envision print media continuing to evolve and adapt within the digital landscape, providing a unique and valuable enhancement to online content. Ultimately, the coexistence of both online and print media will offer readers a variety of choices, allowing them to select the format that best aligns with their preferences and needs.
350;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In many societies, choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered. Nevertheless, while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor, I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard.To begin with, I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well. However, aspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life. People, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary. In this sense, it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position.Further and even more importantly, most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements, skills and the position they reach. In other words, career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are, likely, more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary. For example, people, who work in monotonous jobs, where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied, even though they have a very good salaries.In conclusion, I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators, as there are other even more important aspects such as: friendly co-workers, working conditions and professional achievements.;When evaluating a job offer, it's common to view salary as the most critical factor. However, I partially disagree with this viewpoint. While a competitive salary is certainly an essential component of any position, it is not the only consideration for many people.On one hand, a satisfactory salary is vital for covering living expenses, repaying debts, and achieving financial security, particularly for those with significant financial obligations. A generous salary can also signify the value an employer places on an employee's skills and contributions, enhancing morale and job satisfaction.Conversely, there are numerous other factors that significantly impact job satisfaction and overall quality of life. Elements such as personal fulfillment, job security, opportunities for growth and development, work-life balance, and the work environment are just a few examples. Many individuals prioritize these factors over salary, particularly when they offer a sense of purpose, flexible working conditions, or chances for career advancement. Additionally, studies indicate that once basic financial needs are satisfied, further income doesn't necessarily correlate with increased happiness or job satisfaction.In summary, while salary is an important consideration when selecting a job, it is not the only factor, and its significance can vary widely among individuals. Personal values, career aspirations, and circumstances all shape what aspects of a job are most important. Thus, a balanced perspective that weighs both financial and non-financial elements is likely to yield greater overall job satisfaction and a healthier work-life balance. Ultimately, the importance of salary should be contextual, reflecting each person's unique priorities and needs.
351;Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on children. Do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, computer is an essential part of everyday life. Around the globe, the effect is evident on children also. It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis. This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers.The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text, image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about. As an example, students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter. It's hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers. That is how, computer impacts children on a positive note.Nowadays, computers enable people to prepare presentations, draw complex graphs and pictures, document thesis in a simple though efficient way. When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age, they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world. For instance, students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects, get an edge over others at an early stage of their career. From this, it's clear that computer has a positive effect on the children.Following the demonstration of a computer's contribution in children's study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards, it is agreed that computer is a boon to children. However, parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don't get misled.;Computers have become a vital aspect of everyday life, and children are no exception to this trend. While they provide vast amounts of information and educational opportunities, I believe that daily computer use can have more detrimental effects than beneficial ones for children.Excessive time spent on computers can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, increasing the risk of obesity and various health issues. Additionally, extended screen time can cause eye strain, headaches, and a reduced attention span. The internet also poses risks such as cyberbullying, online predators, and exposure to unsuitable content, all of which can have serious emotional and psychological impacts on young users.Although computers can offer some educational advantages, including access to learning software and online materials, these benefits can often be overshadowed by the drawbacks of excessive usage. Furthermore, heavy computer use can contribute to social isolation, less face-to-face interaction, and diminished creativity, as children may prioritize screen time over outdoor activities, sports, or imaginative pursuits.In summary, while computers can serve as valuable educational tools, the adverse effects of excessive usage on children’s physical and mental health, social interactions, and creativity should not be overlooked. It is essential for parents and caregivers to set boundaries and oversee computer time to promote a balanced and healthy relationship with technology. By doing so, we can help minimize the negative consequences of computer use and enable children to enjoy the benefits of technology while maintaining a well-rounded lifestyle.
352;Children who are brought up in families that do not have large amounts of money are better prepared to deal with the problems of adult life than children brought up by wealthy parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;According to some people, child who is brought up in less well-off family is more quick-witted and can tackle with an adult life problems better than who is from affluent ones. However, I completely disagree with this position.To begin with, children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as: crime, thievery and thuggery. Moreover, these people will not have an access to a good education. As a result, they can be proselytized into bad isms. For example, most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people, because the person with better education has a wider outlook, which will allow no brainwash. In this sense, people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms.Nevertheless, people who are born in well-off families have access to good education, which will have a positive impact on their later life. Secondly, children from rich families have better skills on how to use money, because they use it a lot of times. Finally, wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines, which will be very beneficial for the health of a child. For instance, many good medicines cost vast amounts of money, which cannot be afforded by poorer families.In conclusion, I disagree with the opinion that children who are brought up in less well-of families are, likely, more successful in the future life due to aforementioned reasons.;I partially agree with the viewpoint that children from low-income families may be better equipped to handle the challenges of adulthood than those from affluent families. On one hand, children in low-income households often cultivate crucial life skills such as budgeting, resourcefulness, and resilience. Growing up with limited financial resources teaches them the importance of money and how to maximize what they have. These skills are vital for navigating the uncertainties and challenges that often accompany adult life.Conversely, children from wealthy families typically benefit from a safety net that shields them from the harsh realities of financial hardship. As a result, they may not develop the same financial literacy and problem-solving abilities as their low-income peers. That said, it is also worth noting that wealthy families can offer their children access to high-quality education, healthcare, and networking opportunities, which can be advantageous in the long term.Additionally, suggesting that children from low-income families are inherently better prepared for adult life oversimplifies the intricate issues associated with socioeconomic status and personal growth. Factors such as parental guidance, role modeling, and community support significantly influence a child's capacity to thrive in adulthood, irrespective of their family's financial situation. In conclusion, while children from low-income families might cultivate certain advantageous skills due to their economic conditions, it would be inaccurate to claim they are universally better prepared than those from wealthy families. Ultimately, a child's readiness for adult life is shaped by a multitude of factors, including their upbringing, education, and individual traits.
353;Many of the medical problems that people are experiencing in today's world are due to the fact that we have a very sedentary lifestyle. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;It is certainly true that modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before. Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle. However, while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors, I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact.To begin with, I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems. The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology. In earlier times, for instance, even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities. Nowadays people, especially inhabitants of cities, are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools.Nevertheless, there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems. Firstly, the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses. Many people, for example, are suffering from allergy because of these gasses. Secondly, foods with a low quality such as fast foods, junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively. Finally, life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam, traffic accidents and others.Given these evidences, it can be seen that people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses due to aforementioned reasons.;The idea that a sedentary lifestyle significantly contributes to various health issues in today’s society is widely acknowledged. I fully support this view, as research indicates that insufficient physical activity is a major risk factor for numerous medical conditions. With the increasing prevalence of technology and automation, many individuals find themselves sitting for the majority of the day—whether at work or at home—resulting in a marked decrease in physical activity levels.Extensive research has established a correlation between a sedentary lifestyle and heightened risks of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Extended periods of inactivity can result in several health concerns, such as hypertension, poor circulation, and a compromised immune system. Additionally, a lack of movement can adversely affect mental health, contributing to heightened anxiety and depression among those who lead inactive lifestyles.In contrast, engaging in regular physical activity offers a multitude of health advantages, including effective weight management, enhanced mood, and a lowered risk of chronic illnesses. Governments and health organizations globally are increasingly acknowledging the critical role of physical activity and are launching initiatives to inspire more active living among the population. For instance, many workplaces now provide wellness programs that feature exercise classes and fitness challenges to foster physical activity among employees.In summary, I firmly believe that a sedentary lifestyle plays a crucial role in the prevalence of many health issues in contemporary society. The evidence is compelling: maintaining regular physical activity is vital for both physical and mental well-being. By incorporating simple changes into our daily routines—such as opting for stairs instead of elevators or taking brief walks during lunch breaks—we can significantly mitigate our risk of various health problems and enhance our overall quality of life.
354;Foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten. Do you agree or disagree?;"Educational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children. Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school. However, those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years. This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children's learning. I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten.To begin with, children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years. Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to. Moreover, teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning. Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language, so quality education will be delivered. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners, and the best time to hone them is in their younger years. The introduction of foreign language will be new to them; however, their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend. In this way, grasping a new language will be natural to them. In addition, the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers. Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years. It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages.In conclusion, the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people; however, there are those who disagree. I am totally convinced that if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools, this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children.";The discussion regarding the appropriate age to start foreign language education has ignited considerable debate among educators and linguists. While some contend that kindergarten is too soon for such instruction, I firmly advocate for the early introduction of foreign languages, as it offers significant benefits for young learners.Implementing foreign language instruction in kindergarten comes with a host of advantages. Firstly, it enables children to develop native-like accents and pronunciations, as their brains are more adept at absorbing new sounds and intonations at a younger age. Furthermore, young children exhibit a natural curiosity and a remarkable ability to learn languages quickly, making this an ideal time for language exposure. Research also indicates that early language learning can enhance cognitive development, boost memory, and improve problem-solving abilities.Additionally, starting foreign language instruction in kindergarten lays a robust foundation for future language learning. As students advance in their education, they will be better positioned to build on their existing knowledge and deepen their understanding of the language. In today’s globalized society, being multilingual is an invaluable asset that opens up a myriad of opportunities in both personal and professional realms.In summary, I strongly support the idea of initiating foreign language instruction in kindergarten. The advantages of early language exposure significantly outweigh any potential disadvantages. By starting at an early age, children can establish a strong foundation in a new language, enhance their cognitive skills, and prepare themselves for success in an increasingly interconnected world. Therefore, I urge educators and policymakers to prioritize foreign language instruction in kindergarten to provide young learners with the best possible beginning.
355;International tourism has become a huge industry in the world. Some people think that the problems caused by international tourism outweigh benefits. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the advancement of long-distance transportation, international tourism has boomed in the last few decades. Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits. I disagree with this view.I admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment. In order to meet the needs of tourists, local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions, which may result in the destruction of natural habitats. Tourism also creates more pollution and waste, including growing emission of greenhouse gases, dumped leftovers and overuse of water, power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels. Based on these grounds, it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be encouraged.However, flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy. Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions, but also pay for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment. Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services, and more employment opportunities can be created as well. I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment.Furthermore, the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well. The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably. With adequate local facilities and services available, they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing. In addition, both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before, and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations.In conclusion, the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale. Although there are some inevitable problems, they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken.;The growth of international tourism has significantly changed how individuals travel and engage with various cultures. Although some believe that the disadvantages of international tourism outweigh the benefits, I partially disagree. I contend that the advantages of international tourism can surpass its challenges, provided it is managed sustainably.On one side, international tourism can lead to considerable issues such as environmental damage, cultural dilution, and pressure on local infrastructure. An influx of tourists can trigger pollution, damage natural habitats, and contribute to a decrease in biodiversity. Moreover, the commercialization of local cultures may result in the erosion of traditional practices. For example, cities like Venice and Barcelona have experienced over-tourism, causing local residents to be displaced and historical sites to suffer.Conversely, international tourism can offer various economic and social advantages to a country. It generates employment, boosts local economies, and encourages cultural exchange. Additionally, tourism can aid in the preservation of natural and cultural heritage sites, as the income derived from tourism can be allocated to conservation initiatives. Furthermore, tourism promotes global understanding and tolerance as individuals from diverse backgrounds interact and learn from one another.To achieve a balance between the benefits and challenges of international tourism, it is crucial to adopt sustainable tourism practices. This includes implementing strategies to minimize waste and pollution, supporting local businesses and communities, and encouraging responsible behaviors among tourists. By embracing these practices, international tourism can serve as a positive influence for economic and cultural development while also safeguarding the environment and cultural heritage of a country. In conclusion, although international tourism brings certain challenges, its advantages can prevail if approached in a sustainable and responsible way.
356;Some children can learn more efficiently by watching TV. Therefore, children should watch TV regularly both in school and at home? do you agree or disagree? ;Education is undeniably pivotal for an individual. Although, it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children, I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs. The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method. Thus, physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters' skills.To begin with, classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child. Technology and its advance, to some degrees, have influenced the educational industry positively. Nevertheless, it has not changed the importance of teachers' role in classes. The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this. Yet, monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless. Therefore, teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens. Secondly, watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it. On the other hand, children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity, cooperation, competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms. For instance, a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries. As a result, such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career.In conclusion, despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children, kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity. School has been applying traditional teaching procedure since for ages. Additionally, it still performs at its best to equip a child with essential skills.;The proposition that children should regularly watch TV both at school and at home because it can enhance learning for some is a debatable topic. While it's acknowledged that visual aids like television can support certain learning styles—especially for visual learners—the notion of routinely using TV as an educational tool is not entirely persuasive.On one hand, television can serve as an engaging and effective medium for learning for some children. Educational programs often present complex ideas in a fun and easily digestible way, making the learning process more enjoyable and approachable. This can be particularly advantageous for subjects such as history, science, or geography, where visual elements can significantly aid comprehension and memory retention.On the flip side, excessive television consumption, even for educational goals, can lead to adverse effects. It can promote a sedentary lifestyle, contribute to obesity, and hinder social interactions and physical activity. Moreover, not all programming is educational or appropriate for children, posing a risk of exposure to unsuitable content. In a school environment, where the content can be carefully managed, this risk is lessened, but at home, the responsibility for ensuring that TV viewing remains educational falls on parents, who may not always provide adequate supervision.In summary, although some children may learn more effectively through television, promoting regular TV viewing in both educational and home contexts as a common practice is not advisable. A more balanced strategy that incorporates television as one of many educational resources in controlled circumstances seems wiser. This approach allows children to reap the benefits of educational programming while minimizing its potential drawbacks. Ultimately, employing a diverse range of teaching methods, including television but not limited to it, is essential for addressing varied learning styles and fostering a comprehensive education.
357;In some countries, with the widespread use of the internet, people are able to work or study from home, instead of having to travel to work or college. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages? Discuss and state your own opinion.;Undoubtedly this is an era of internet which impacts one's personal as well as professional life. The effect is seen more on the developed countries where people choose to work or study from home instead of going to office or university. Some consider this approach to be an advantage while others reject this as a disadvantage. Both the points of views will be discussed in order.On the one hand, the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous. For one, it helps working people to maintain work life balance. The best example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby. People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours. For students too, studying from home is an attractive option. They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies. In a busy city like Tokyo, students waste a lot of time in travelling. Thus, the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home, are obvious.On the other hand, one part of the society, has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home. Many employers argue that once an employee works from isolation, he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues. This harms an employee's deliverable. Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly. Due to this they lag in their studies. These factors affect people who work or study from home.Following both the point of views, the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks. It is hoped that people will continue to use internet to work or study and improve on the disadvantages into the foreseeable future.;The widespread use of the internet has fundamentally transformed the way we work and learn, allowing individuals to do so from the comfort of their homes. This shift has ignited a lively discussion about whether the benefits of remote work and study outweigh the challenges. In my view, the advantages of this setup significantly exceed the downsides.On one side, working or studying from home presents a variety of benefits. For instance, it eliminates the time and expenses associated with commuting and creates a comfortable, distraction-free space that can enhance productivity. Additionally, it opens up employment and educational opportunities for individuals with disabilities or those residing in remote locations. Moreover, without the typical office distractions, many can concentrate better and accomplish more in a shorter time frame.Conversely, there are some drawbacks to consider. Prolonged periods spent alone at home can lead to social isolation, which may negatively affect social skills and increase stress. Furthermore, the lack of in-person interaction with colleagues or peers can impede teamwork and collaboration. However, these issues can be addressed through regular video calls or scheduled in-person gatherings.In summary, while working or studying from home does present certain disadvantages, I strongly believe that the benefits far outweigh them. The flexibility and comfort of this arrangement can enhance productivity, foster a better work-life balance, and improve overall well-being. As technology continues to evolve, it's likely that remote work and education will become even more common, which I see as a positive trend offering numerous advantages for individuals and society at large.
358;International tourism has become the biggest industry in the world. Some people think it causes tension between people from different culture. Others think it leads to understanding between countries. To what extend do you agree or disagree?Ê;I agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture, because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates.There is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area. Firstly, some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions. Therefore, those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment. Moreover, tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background. For example, Indians don't eat beef since they worship cows. Thus, if tourists want to respect the tradition, they will not order any beef in the local restaurant. On the other hand, in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals, people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions. For instance, tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place. Furthermore, the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries. Thus, the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties.Obviously, people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism. Hence, I think international tourism leads to both tension and understanding between people from different culture.;The growth of international tourism has resulted in an increase in cultural exchange among individuals from varied backgrounds. While some may argue that this trend can create tensions between different cultures, I strongly maintain that it enhances understanding and fosters global unity.On one side, it’s true that cultural differences can sometimes result in misunderstandings and friction. For instance, tourists might inadvertently offend locals by neglecting local customs or traditions due to their unfamiliarity with the host nation’s values and norms. This can indeed lead to conflicts between people from diverse cultural backgrounds.However, I believe that the advantages of international tourism in enhancing cross-cultural understanding significantly outweigh any negative aspects. When people travel to new countries, they encounter unfamiliar customs, traditions, and lifestyles. This exposure has the potential to challenge stereotypes and misunderstandings, allowing individuals to cultivate a deeper appreciation and respect for the rich diversity of human experiences.In addition, tourism fosters opportunities for individuals to connect, share ideas, and learn from each other's viewpoints. Such exchanges can help dismantle cultural barriers and promote greater empathy and understanding among nations. Numerous countries have recognized tourism’s potential for cultural diplomacy and have set up initiatives aimed at facilitating interpersonal connections through travel.In summary, while cultural differences may occasionally lead to conflicts, I firmly believe that international tourism offers significant potential to enhance understanding and cooperation between nations. As the world continues to grow more interconnected, it is essential that we acknowledge the importance of cultural exchange and strive to promote greater cross-cultural understanding through tourism and other avenues. By doing so, we can build a more harmonious and peaceful global community.
359;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do. While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation, this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs.It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public. For example, some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media, thereby gaining the public attention. If they continue to behave in such a way, it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work. Consequently, the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status. This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits. Nevertheless, I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments. Firstly, celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans. This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results. Therefore, this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance. Secondly, other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career. Take Michael Jackson as an example, his works are widely spread around the world, and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation. His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other, which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society. In summary, although some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance, other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction.;"The idea that celebrities are often better known for their glamour and riches than for their achievements has ignited a lively discussion. I partially concur with this perspective; although it contains elements of truth, there are notable exceptions.On one hand, the intense emphasis on the extravagant lifestyles and appearances of celebrities can negatively affect young individuals. The relentless stream of images depicting their lavish homes, distinctive fashion, and extravagant parties can foster unrealistic aspirations and encourage materialism. Young fans may overly idolize the pursuit of wealth and fame, overlooking the hard work and commitment that underpins a celebrity's success. This can distort their understanding of what truly matters in life, placing more value on superficial traits than on real talent and accomplishments.Conversely, many celebrities leverage their influence to champion positive ideals and highlight their own achievements. For example, a number of actors and musicians use their visibility to shed light on social and environmental issues, motivating youth to create positive change. Additionally, some well-known figures are celebrated for their philanthropic endeavors, their dedication to their art, and their resilience in overcoming challenges. These exemplary individuals illustrate that true success is not merely synonymous with glamour and wealth, but is grounded in hard work, passion, and unwavering determination.In summary, while it is accurate that some celebrities are primarily recognized for their glamour and affluence, I contend this is not a blanket statement applicable to all. Numerous positive role models in the world of celebrities embody commendable values and achievements, and it is vital for young people to encounter these figures as well. Ultimately, it's essential for the younger generation to cultivate a balanced viewpoint, understanding that genuine success encompasses much more than mere glamour and wealth."
360;Children can effectively learn from watching television. Therefore they should be encouraged to watch TV in both home and school. Agree/Disagree?;TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it. But I believe that by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth. If children spend too much time in front of TV, it will negatively impact their health and study.It is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information. There are international and local news channels like BBC, CNBC, Etv Gujarati, Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings. By watching TV, children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities. For example, Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly, sports events like cricket, football can teach leadership skills, team building skills, communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs.But on other hand, watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health. For example, they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood, and also develop back pain. Sometimes, students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences. Many times, students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels, or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades. In conclusion, I believe demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits and thus if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children.;I disagree with the notion that children can effectively learn from watching television and that TV viewing should be promoted both at home and in schools. Although television can serve as a valuable educational resource, it cannot replace traditional teaching methods or hands-on learning experiences.On one hand, certain television programs, such as documentaries and educational series, can offer children important information and insights across various topics. These programs have the potential to ignite curiosity and foster an interest in learning, and they may even enhance critical thinking skills. However, these advantages are only achievable if children are consuming high-quality, educational content, and if parents or teachers are available to help them comprehend and apply the knowledge gained.Conversely, excessive television viewing can negatively impact children's learning and development. Spending too much time in front of the screen can contribute to a sedentary lifestyle, social isolation, and reduced attention spans. Additionally, many shows are not designed with educational purposes in mind and may actually impede learning by portraying violent or inappropriate behaviors.In conclusion, while television can be a useful supplement to learning, it should not serve as the primary source of education. Children should be encouraged to participate in diverse learning activities, including reading, practical experiments, and social interactions, to achieve a balanced education. Parents and teachers should take an active role in guiding children's TV viewing, ensuring they focus on quality educational programs while also engaging in other enriching activities.
361;It has been claimed that workers over 50 are not responsive to rapidly changing ideas in the modern workplace and that for this reason younger workers are to be preferred. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Throughout human history, the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor. This is still true in the industrial society nowadays, where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers. There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace.First and foremost, old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm. The old were raised in poverty, probably caused by war, look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view. The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change, or more precisely, to accept the existence of such modernity. For example, most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human's capability.Secondly, their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life. In other words, that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology. This, by all means, is outweigh by youngsters' adventurousness and bravery. Blatantly seen, success of most companies stems from young people, whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment.Last but not least, knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly. Who would the employer choose, an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject, but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages. Not to undermine old workers, but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace.All in a nutshell, workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects. However, in my point of view, it is still of great importance to remain the harmonious coexistence of both sides for the smooth sailing of the company.;"The belief that workers over 50 are less adaptable to the fast-paced changes of today's workplace—and therefore less desirable compared to younger employees—is a stereotype that warrants examination. While some older individuals may find it challenging to keep up with new technologies or innovative methods, it is unjust to label this as a defining trait of all workers in that age group.In truth, many older employees bring valuable skills and experiences that significantly contribute to the modern work environment. Their extensive tenure provides them with a profound industry knowledge, exceptional problem-solving capabilities, and strong communication skills. Furthermore, their maturity and stability can offer a sense of continuity and leadership during periods of rapid change. Additionally, older workers are often highly motivated and dedicated, leading to greater job satisfaction and lower turnover rates.Conversely, younger workers can introduce fresh viewpoints, innovative ideas, and advanced technological skills to the workforce. However, this doesn’t imply they are inherently more adaptable than their older colleagues. In fact, older workers frequently demonstrate a willingness to learn and grow professionally, often eager to acquire new skills and embrace new challenges.In summary, the notion that workers over 50 are less adaptable and thus inferior to younger workers is a simplistic view that fails to capture the complexities of today’s workforce. Both age groups possess unique strengths and weaknesses; a diverse workforce that includes individuals of all ages is likely to be the most successful and innovative. Instead of favoring one age group over another, employers should strive to cultivate an inclusive work environment that appreciates and supports the contributions of all employees, regardless of their age."
362;The use of machines are increasing day by day which is reducing physical work done by humans. Do you think advantages outweigh the disadvantages ;Advancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades. This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days. These machines reduce the physical work done by humans. Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans.Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached.It is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people. For example, in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days. People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs. It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity. So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects.On other side of the coin, many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work. Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens. The work of chopping, blending, grating, kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes. Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome.After analyzing these two points of view, it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth. The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy. Therefore, it is hoped that in coming time people will enjoy using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay disease free.;The growing incorporation of machines into our everyday lives has significantly diminished the amount of physical labor performed by humans. Although some critics argue that this shift is harmful to human health and productivity, I strongly contend that the benefits of machine utilization far surpass the drawbacks.On one side, the benefits of using machines are extensive. They have enhanced efficiency and productivity across various sectors, facilitating quicker and more precise work processes. For example, in manufacturing, machines have made mass production possible, which lowers production costs and boosts output. Furthermore, machines have transformed healthcare by allowing medical professionals to diagnose and treat illnesses more effectively. Technologies like MRI and CT scanners have revolutionized medical imaging, enabling early detection and intervention for various health conditions.Conversely, the decline in physical labor has raised concerns regarding its effects on human health. Extended periods of inactivity can contribute to obesity, cardiovascular issues, and other health-related problems. However, these risks can be addressed by incorporating physical activity into our daily lives, such as through exercise or sports. Additionally, machines allow individuals to concentrate on more intricate and creative endeavors, including research, innovation, and problem-solving, which are vital for societal advancement.In summary, while the rise in machine usage has resulted in less physical work for humans, I believe the advantages it brings greatly outweigh the disadvantages. Machines have enhanced efficiency, productivity, and healthcare, while also enabling people to engage in more complex and creative activities. By integrating physical exercise into our daily routines, we can counteract the negative impacts of reduced physical labor and fully enjoy the benefits of machine use.
363;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;These days, most of countries on the world invest for technology. It is evident that technology promotes economy. Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated. I totally disagree this opinion.First of all, traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture. They make differences between countries. Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation, intelligence. Consequently, people feel pround of their country, so they keep reserving conventions. For example, ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries.In addition, in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology. Lot of people like to use traditional things because if their quality and durability. In paticular, vases are made by hand would be used more. Futhermore, there are plenty of works that using traditional way is unique method. For instance, making cone hats from leaves have to use hand. Not only because there is no machine for the work, but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand, so resulting in greater value economy.The last thing is about education. Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history. Methods which their ancestors used in the past will be displayed again for new generations. After that, they might create somethings that are useful for life.In conclusion, technology has brought many benefits, but traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever.;The idea that traditional skills and lifestyles become irrelevant as technology advances is a topic of much discussion. While some contend that there is little value in maintaining traditional practices amidst technological growth, I hold a differing view to some degree.On one hand, it’s clear that technological progress has led to the diminishing of certain traditional skills and lifestyles. For instance, automation and artificial intelligence have taken over many manual labor jobs, making some traditional crafts and professions obsolete. Additionally, the effort to conserve these outdated practices might impede a nation’s progress and its ability to compete in the global economy.Conversely, I am convinced that preserving traditional skills and ways of life is crucial for safeguarding cultural heritage and identity. Many traditional practices, including craftsmanship, folk music, and indigenous knowledge, represent significant parts of a nation's history and cultural richness. The loss of these traditions would not only erase aspects of a country’s identity but also rob future generations of their cultural heritage. Moreover, several traditional skills, such as sustainable farming and artisanal craftsmanship, can still hold relevance and provide innovative solutions to contemporary challenges.In summary, while it is valid to acknowledge that some traditional skills and lifestyles may wane in significance in light of technological advancements, it is not futile to strive to keep them alive. A balanced approach—aiming to preserve and adapt traditional practices to coexist with modern technology—can foster cultural diversity and identity. By valuing and promoting traditional skills and ways of life, a nation can ensure that its cultural heritage endures alongside technological progress.
364;The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots. The problem off traffic overload, caused by overpopulation, has aroused interest of many city planners. It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock. However, I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way.First of all, public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street. Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options. Apparently, a bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number. Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles. Together, they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays.Second, rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas. It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now. As a rule of thumb, huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities. The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people.In conclusion, city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas. It is highly recommended to put forward such solution, especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China, with the ever-growing demand for job or education.;The idea that minimizing the need for individuals to travel for work, education, or shopping is the only solution to reduce traffic congestion in urban areas is a matter of discussion. While I acknowledge that decreasing daily commutes can play a significant role in mitigating traffic, it's not the sole approach to this challenge.On one side, the reduction of travel requirements can be facilitated by flexible work options. With the rise of remote work, employees can perform their jobs from home, which lessens the need for commuting. Likewise, the growth of online education and shopping platforms reduces the necessity for physical attendance at schools and stores, leading to fewer vehicles on the road and, consequently, less traffic congestion.Conversely, there are additional effective strategies to alleviate urban traffic. Enhancing public transportation options—such as buses, trains, and subways—can incentivize people to opt for shared transportation, thus lowering the number of private vehicles. Furthermore, urban planning initiatives that prioritize pedestrian and cyclist-friendly infrastructure can discourage personal vehicle use for short trips.In summary, while minimizing the requirement for travel from home for work, education, or shopping is a valuable tactic in reducing traffic congestion, it is not the only one. A comprehensive approach that includes flexible work and schooling options, improved public transit, and intelligent urban planning is essential for effectively addressing urban traffic issues. By implementing a combination of these strategies, cities can strive towards creating a more sustainable, efficient, and congestion-free environment for their residents.
365;Celebrities are usually famous for glamour and wealth rather than their achievements. Some say taking them as an example can be dangerous for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Young people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities. These celebrities are popular among younger generations because of their glamorous lifestyles. It is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth. This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors. First of all, it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents. Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age. For example, in a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes. This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals.Secondly, it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way. Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior. For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools. So, this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people.Thus to conclude, it can be said that when young people follow celebrities, it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way. This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual. Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly, rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future.;"Celebrities often lead lives filled with glamour and wealth, making them widely recognized figures. However, their notoriety doesn't always stem from their accomplishments; rather, it frequently arises from their knack for garnering public attention. I believe that viewing celebrities as role models can be harmful to young people, as their lifestyles and values might not promote a healthy and productive existence.Many celebrities gain fame primarily for their looks, personal lives, or outrageous antics, rather than for any meaningful contributions to society. Impressionable young individuals may idolize these stars and aspire to mimic their ways of living. This focus can shift priorities toward superficial traits, such as appearance and material wealth, rather than fostering essential skills and values.Additionally, the relentless exposure to celebrity culture can instill unrealistic expectations and foster a sense of entitlement in young minds. They might come to believe that they can achieve fame and fortune without the requisite effort and dedication, leading to disillusionment when reality falls short of their aspirations.Moreover, the behaviors and values showcased by some celebrities can negatively impact young people’s well-being. The glorification of excessive partying, lavish spending, and recklessness can result in serious consequences like addiction, financial issues, and damaged relationships. Thus, it is crucial for young individuals to have positive role models who exemplify values such as hard work, kindness, and accountability. By admiring those who have attained success through commitment and resilience, young people can cultivate a more realistic and optimistic perspective on achieving their goals."
366;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The gender issues have been already discussing for many years in order to give solutions for realising the equal proportion of developing human resources. Implementing the statue and right of equal education are believed as a sustainable policy that should be held. Nowadays, there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course. I strongly agree about this statement.The proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently. Automatically, the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people. We can see now that women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers, and dealing with machines. Those activities have proven that women can also do the men's works. Therefore, female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men.Another reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person's career. These days, it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities. So, learning from human's history, education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college. According to this opinion, giving equal education for both men and women is a must.In conclusion, the needs for having developed-skills and gaining degree certificate in order to build someone's career are totally needed to implement and applied for any gender. As the world's situation is always changing, act for distributing education needs are absolutely important to compete the future challenges.;The proposal to admit equal numbers of male and female students in every university program has ignited significant discussion. Advocates of this policy assert that it fosters gender equality, while critics argue that it compromises meritocracy and individual choice. I see some merit in both viewpoints, though I hold reservations.On one hand, achieving equal representation of male and female students could rectify long-standing disparities in fields like engineering and physics, where men have historically been overrepresented. By encouraging female participation in these areas, universities can significantly contribute to promoting gender equality and dismantling stereotypes. This initiative could lead to a richer and more inclusive educational experience, benefiting all students.Conversely, I oppose the implementation of strict quotas, as this could result in less qualified candidates being admitted solely to fulfill numerical requirements. Such practices may damage the academic credibility of institutions and might not serve the best interests of students. Moreover, individuals should have the liberty to select their academic paths based on personal interests and strengths, rather than being compelled to enter certain fields to satisfy quotas.In summary, while I support universities’ efforts to create a more balanced and inclusive atmosphere, I do not believe that enforcing equal admissions for male and female students across all disciplines is the most effective strategy. Instead, universities should aim to foster an environment that encourages all students, regardless of gender, to pursue their academic passions without the constraints of rigid quotas. This approach would promote genuine equality and diversity beyond mere numerical parity.
367;It has been proved that smoking kills. In some countries it has been made illegal for people to smoke in all public places except in certain areas. All countries should make these rules. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;People the world over have designated smoothing as a shameful practice and a lethal habit. Several millions of smokers die suffering from cancers such as lung and oral. This bad habit also responsible for causing health hazards to passive-smokers: who are around smoking is taken place. Thus, it is argued that smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations. This position will be proven by looking at how this arrangement has benefited both general public as well as smokers.To start, non-smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain. Prior to 1980's public places in Sri Lanka, illustrates unpleasant situation where people smoked freely. Even in public transportation they engaged in this intolerant bad habit, some instances that lead to belligerent incidents. After enforcing restrictions the situation came to control and this act as benefit rendered to the public.In addition to this, introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing. For instance, further enforcement banned smoking in capital in Sri Lanka has reduced this consumption related diseases and deaths, as per the ministry of health. As this shows, smoking restrictions has successfully daunted public from this bad puffing that put less strain on country's healthcare systems.After analyzing smoke illegalization in public places in Sri Lanka, it has been proven benefits people enjoy this arrangement. It is thus hoped governments would consider smoke banning in public places following footsteps of Sri Lanka as well as many other countries.;The proposition that all nations should prohibit smoking in public areas, with exceptions for specific designated zones, is a topic of intense discussion. I support this idea, as the harmful effects of smoking on both smokers and non-smokers are well-established. Smoking ranks as a primary cause of preventable deaths globally, and exposure to second-hand smoke carries serious health risks as well.By implementing a ban on smoking in public spaces, countries can markedly decrease the incidence of smoking-related illnesses and fatalities. Designated smoking areas can provide a space for smokers while shielding non-smokers from the dangers of second-hand smoke. Such a policy could also help diminish the social acceptance of smoking, especially among youth, discouraging them from developing the habit.Furthermore, a consistent smoking ban across nations could enhance international collaboration and standardize public health initiatives. It would also encourage a culture that respects non-smokers' rights to clean air and lessen the economic strain caused by smoking-related healthcare expenses. However, it is crucial to roll out this policy gradually, ensuring there is ample public education and support for those looking to quit.In summary, given the overwhelming evidence regarding the harms associated with smoking, I firmly advocate for all countries to implement laws making smoking in public areas illegal, except in designated zones. This approach can significantly safeguard public health, foster a smoke-free culture, and ultimately save countless lives.
368;Tourism is a modern form of colonialism. It distorts local economies, causes environmental damage and ruins the places it exploits. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Tourism, since its first appearance a long time ago, can be described as a controversial celebrity. Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion, environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places. However, I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons.First of all, tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be. Basically, places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas, of which economy, before their appearance, haven't blossmed yet. Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up. It will, by all means, attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents. In other word, tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction, which exploit the best out of its own potential.Secondly, even though environmental damage is inevitable, it is not tourism to be blamed for. In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction, the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration. To be precise, for instance, a fortune is spent on trimming the trees, watering the flowers, preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora, in the hope of beautifying the wild. Not to mention ecotourism, a new kind of environment-friendly service, which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures. Because of that, tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity.All thing considered, tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact. In my opinion, the combination of tourism and teaching process is highly recommended in pursuit of a harmonial relationship between human and their surroundings.;The idea that tourism represents a contemporary version of colonialism is a contentious topic that has generated considerable debate. While it's clear that tourism can negatively impact local economies and the environment, I find myself only partially in agreement with this perspective. On one hand, tourism may indeed resemble a form of colonialism, with affluent countries capitalizing on the resources and attractions of less wealthy nations for their own gain. This exploitation can distort local economies, as the surge in tourism generates artificial demand for specific goods and services, leading to inflated prices that locals often cannot afford.Additionally, tourism can inflict substantial environmental harm. The development of hotels, resorts, and other tourist facilities can result in the destruction of natural habitats and the depletion of resources. The large number of visitors can also overwhelm local infrastructure, causing problems like overcrowding, pollution, and increased pressure on community resources. However, on the other hand, tourism can serve as an effective instrument for economic growth and cultural interchange. When approached sustainably, it can create jobs, invigorate local economies, and foster understanding across cultures.Countries like Costa Rica and New Zealand provide examples of successful sustainable tourism practices that emphasize environmental stewardship and community involvement. In summary, while tourism has the potential for negative impacts, it is an oversimplification to label it strictly as a form of modern colonialism. Rather, it is a complex and nuanced field that necessitates thoughtful management and strategic planning to ensure equitable benefits while minimizing adverse effects. By embracing sustainable tourism strategies, we can advance economic progress, encourage cultural exchange, and protect the environment, fostering a more just and responsible tourism sector.
369;In the last 20 years there have been significant development in the field of information technology (IT), for example the World Wide Web and communication by e-mail. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;The appearance of information technology (IT) in the last 20 years has brought about significant developments in life standard as well as work efficiency. However, it is believed that the evolution also proves to be detrimental. In my opinion, there is a likelihood that future developments in IT will put the users at their own expense.With the rapid developing pace, IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves. In the past, there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail, but the cyber world now varies form games, online TV shows to means of communication, and probably still keeps going. Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones, resulting in their dependence on technical equipment. What is more, the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict, therefore, staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative.Future IT has also aroused concern on health issues. The existence of Skype, Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click. As a result, rarely do people go out of their comfot zone, provided with snack and air conditioner, to assemble with others in flesh. Needless to say, their action will make a beeline for obesity, short-sighted, diabetes and other heart-related problems.In conclusion, despite the contribution of IT to the society, its effect on the users' independence and prositution should not be out of concern. To my mind, there have to be some alterations before IT has more serious impact on each individual's life.;Over the past twenty years, the field of information technology (IT) has experienced remarkable advancements, transforming the ways we communicate, engage, and retrieve information. The emergence of the World Wide Web and email, in particular, has played a crucial role in connecting people across the globe and diminishing geographical barriers. Nonetheless, the viewpoint that future IT progress might yield more negative consequences than positive requires careful consideration.On one hand, it is reasonable to suggest that future developments in IT could lead to unfavorable outcomes. For example, a growing dependence on automation and artificial intelligence may result in substantial job losses, worsening unemployment and widening socioeconomic gaps. Additionally, the rise of social media and online platforms has already raised concerns about privacy, data security, and the dissemination of misinformation. These challenges could intensify with further advancements in IT, potentially leading to more severe negative repercussions.Conversely, it is equally valid to argue that the advantages of future IT innovations will surpass the downsides. Emerging technologies like blockchain, advanced data analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) offer significant potential for addressing complex global issues, such as improving healthcare access, promoting environmental sustainability, and reducing educational disparities. For instance, telemedicine and health informatics can enhance healthcare services for remote and underserved communities, while smart city projects aim to boost energy efficiency and minimize waste.In summary, while it is important to recognize the possible negative impacts of future IT advancements, it appears more logical to conclude that these innovations will continue to produce greater benefits than drawbacks. With responsible innovation, strategic planning, and effective regulatory frameworks, we can maximize the advantages of IT while minimizing its risks. Ultimately, the future impact of IT will hinge on how societies opt to leverage its potential, ensuring that technology aligns with humanity's best interests.
370;An increasing number of people are turning to vegetarianism. some belive that people are following a vegetarian diet for reasons other than animal rights issues. Do you agree with this? Give reasons why some people are choosing to become vegetarian;Since the dawn of time, human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources. Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family's meals all around the world. Recent years, however, has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians. Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue, others think it is much beyond that. It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect.Firstly, health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular. Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer. This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health. Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake, it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources.Secondy, relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet. Some religion, such as Buddha, believes that animals were human being in their previous life, so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings. It is often said that this view is rather unscientific. However, I am convinced that it is vital to follow one's own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind.To sum up, it is evident for me that people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals. However, a meal which is nutritionally balanced is always most recommended.;In recent years, the adoption of a vegetarian lifestyle has surged, with more individuals opting to refrain from eating meat. While concerns about animal rights are frequently highlighted as a key motivator, a growing number of people are embracing vegetarianism for a variety of reasons that extend beyond ethical considerations. Indeed, the motivations for choosing a vegetarian diet are diverse and multifaceted.A primary factor driving the shift towards vegetarianism is the health benefits associated with a well-structured vegetarian diet. Rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, such a diet can greatly diminish the risk of heart disease, lower blood pressure, and assist in weight management. For many, transitioning to a vegetarian lifestyle is a proactive step towards enhancing their overall health and wellness. Additionally, the high financial and environmental costs of meat consumption contribute to this choice. Plant-based diets are often more budget-friendly and generate a smaller carbon footprint, attracting those who wish to embrace more sustainable practices.Cultural and social influences also play a significant role in the rise of vegetarianism. The popularity of plant-based recipes and lifestyles on social media has spotlighted the variety and richness of vegetarian cuisine, encouraging individuals to experiment with vegetarian options. This exploration may not stem exclusively from a concern for animal welfare but rather from the allure of new culinary experiences and the desire to connect with social circles that champion sustainable living.In summary, while animal rights concerns are a significant motivating factor for some, it is clear that the decision to adopt a vegetarian diet is influenced by a wide array of factors, including health advantages, economic considerations, environmental impacts, and social dynamics. As awareness of dietary consequences grows, it is likely that the trend toward vegetarianism will persist, fueled by a complex blend of motivations that extend well beyond animal rights.
371;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;There is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles. It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions, and there is no need to maintain them. However, from my point of view, what can be expected, is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society.It is undeniable that the country's culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life. For instance, in Vietnam, many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities, are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts. This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor's early life through books and images, which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed.In tradition, a person should look back at the past, mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle, to progress. Understanding why, and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today. Also, study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing.To sumarize, there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life. They are the ones that teach, and will teach us to be self-esteem and experienced, which means their preservation throughout history deserve our attention.;The swift progress of technology has significantly transformed how people live and work. Consequently, some contend that traditional skills and lifestyles are becoming outdated, arguing that efforts to preserve them are in vain. While I recognize that technological advancements can render certain practices unnecessary, I disagree with the belief that preserving them is futile.On one hand, traditional skills and way of life are vital components of a nation's cultural heritage and identity. They foster a sense of continuity and connection to the past, and losing them can result in a disconnect from one's origins. Moreover, various traditional skills, including craftsmanship and artisanal techniques, remain highly esteemed and sought after today. Safeguarding these abilities not only supports cultural diversity but also provides sustainable livelihoods for many.On the other hand, I understand that some traditional practices may lack practicality in today’s tech-driven world. Nonetheless, this does not imply they should vanish completely. Instead, we can strive to adapt and transform these skills to ensure their relevance in contemporary society. For instance, integrating traditional farming methods with modern technology can yield sustainable and efficient agricultural systems.In conclusion, although technological advancements may render certain traditional skills and lifestyles obsolete, it is far from pointless to strive for their preservation. Maintaining cultural heritage and traditional practices is crucial for nurturing a sense of identity and continuity. With thoughtful adaptation and evolution, these traditions can continue to flourish in a modern technological landscape.
372;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""Capital punishment or the death penalty is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime."" In recently years, many countries have polished the law of the death penalty. In the whole world, 51% countries have polished death penalty; even, it is at 98% in Europe. Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase. However, others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty. Personally, I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons.Firstly, capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture. Crimes kill someone which is illegal; nevertheless, the government use law to punish them, which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one. As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time; also, it is regarded as the ""legalized revenge"" to victims' family. Hence, death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture.Secondly, nobody has the right to take another human life. It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being. No one has the right to take the life of a human; even if he committed murder. If you kill a criminal, you become a criminal. Moreover, if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem, it is neither unethical nor immoral. In short, crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment.Finally, with some of serious criminals, capital punishment is an easy way out. Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds. If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins, it is so easy for them. They do not undergo any pain or misery. Why do not we have other wisely punishments? As we can see some industries such as mining, oil and gas extraction, reclamation, etc, needs many labors. Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country- it is better. Moreover, rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts. To conclude, capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge, it is an easy way for serious crimes, and nobody has rights to take others life; thus, it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society. The world should consider clearly about polishing the law of the dead penalty.";The discussion on whether capital punishment effectively curbs violence has ignited vigorous debate. While some contend that the death penalty is crucial for ensuring safety and deterring violent crime, I personally disagree with the idea that our existence becomes less secure in its absence.First and foremost, it is important to recognize that capital punishment has not been convincingly demonstrated to deter violent offenses. Numerous studies indicate that violent crime rates in regions that enforce the death penalty are not significantly lower than those in places that have abolished it. For example, countries such as Norway and Sweden, which do not utilize capital punishment, enjoy some of the lowest crime rates globally. This implies that the connection between capital punishment and crime levels is more intricate than one might assume.Furthermore, one could argue that capital punishment might even worsen societal violence. The implementation of the death penalty can foster a culture of vengeance rather than one of rehabilitation and restorative justice. There is also the critical issue of the potential execution of innocent individuals, leading to irrevocable injustices.Rather than relying on capital punishment, I advocate for a focus on the underlying factors contributing to violent crime, such as poverty, inequality, and lack of education. By channeling resources into social programs and community initiatives, we can strive towards a safer and more equitable society. Alternatives to capital punishment, such as life imprisonment, can serve as effective substitutes that also allow for opportunities for rehabilitation and the expression of remorse.In summary, while the belief that capital punishment is essential for controlling societal violence may appear persuasive, I strongly maintain that it is neither an effective nor a just solution. Our safety does not necessarily diminish without the death penalty, and more constructive and humane approaches exist to tackle the issue of violent crime.
373;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;For a long time, the zoo has been a second home to endangered animals. However, other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing. In my opinion, the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons.First of all, the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners. With zoos, pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of, for instance, a lion or a crocodile. At a higher level, it is of university students' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings, which otherwise would not be at hand. This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels.Secondly, the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection. Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats, which consequently calls for the help of zoos. What is more, the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species. Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as: giraffe, panda, koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory.In sum, the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable. It is highly recommended that zoos should be seen with different perspective in order to function at their most efficiency.;I disagree with the assertion that zoos serve no valuable purpose. While some may see them as merely places for entertainment, I contend that they are crucial for conservation, education, and research. A key function of zoos is to provide a sanctuary for endangered species. Many zoos engage in breeding programs aimed at bolstering the populations of species that are critically endangered. A notable example is the California Condor Recovery Program, a collaboration between zoos and wildlife agencies, which has successfully raised the condor population from just 22 birds in the 1980s to over 500 today.Moreover, zoos act as educational institutions, offering visitors a chance to learn about wildlife and the significance of conservation. By showcasing a diverse array of species, zoos help raise awareness about the planet's biodiversity and the imperative to protect it. Many also feature interactive exhibits and programs designed to educate both children and adults about animal habitats, behaviors, and adaptations. This educational component can motivate individuals to become proactive in environmental protection and wildlife conservation.In addition, zoos contribute to scientific research that deepens our understanding of animal behavior, physiology, and ecology. Numerous zoos house research centers where scientists investigate aspects such as animal behavior, nutrition, and health, which can enhance conservation strategies and improve animal care both in captivity and in natural habitats. In summary, I strongly believe that zoos fulfill a significant role. They are vital to conservation, education, and research, and their contributions are essential. Rather than being mere entertainment venues, zoos are important institutions dedicated to the protection and preservation of our planet's invaluable biodiversity.
374;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion?;"It is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one. I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken, every language should be protected from being disappeared.There are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages, it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them. For example, some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese, so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers, facilities and appropriate materials. Secondly, it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication, trade, cooperation as well as transaction, it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only.Despite of the above arguments, i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages. This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication. In addition, forming a language must be undergone thousands of years; thus, it deserves to be respected and preserved. Last but not least, language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world. Therefore, saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity's preservation.In conclusion, although letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial, it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages.";The topic of language extinction has ignited a vigorous debate on whether governments should invest public funds in preserving languages spoken by small populations. Proponents argue that it is crucial for governments to dedicate resources to saving these languages, as they form an essential part of a community's cultural heritage. Languages are key to a nation's identity, and their disappearance can lead to cultural homogenization and a loss of diversity. Additionally, preserving languages can foster tourism and generate employment, as people develop an interest in learning about and engaging with unique cultures. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that governments should take responsibility for protecting these languages.Conversely, some argue that allocating public funds to save endangered languages is an inefficient use of resources. They point out that the financial demands of language preservation programs are significant, and such funding could be more effectively directed toward addressing urgent issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. Furthermore, in today's globalized society, the value of proficiency in widely spoken languages, such as English, is paramount, and the focus should be on teaching these languages to enhance job prospects and economic opportunities.In my view, while both perspectives hold validity, I believe that language preservation should be a priority for governments. The cultural importance and historical significance of languages far exceed the costs involved in their preservation. Moreover, the benefits of maintaining linguistic diversity, such as increased cultural richness and potential tourism, can yield lasting economic advantages. Thus, it is vital for governments to adopt a proactive stance in safeguarding endangered languages and fostering cultural diversity. This commitment can help preserve unique cultural identities and contribute to a more vibrant and diverse global community.
375;Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagreee with this statement?;"There has always been a saying in medicine: ""Prevention is better than cure"". This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health-protected measures. In my opinion, this plan should be put into practice for the two reasons mentioned accordingly.No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness. Children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones, thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle. What is more, it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of, for instance, not consuming too much fast food, over-fried food or intoxicants.In addition, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases. Needless to say, such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years. Similarly, if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance.To sum up, I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures. This will yield positive results on not only the people's physical and mental development but also their finance.";The distribution of a nation's healthcare budget is a crucial decision that significantly influences the well-being of its citizens. While providing treatment is vital for addressing current health issues, I firmly believe that a considerable portion of the budget should be redirected from treatment to health education and preventative initiatives.Investing in health education and preventive strategies can yield long-lasting advantages, such as lowering disease prevalence and encouraging healthier behaviors. By raising public awareness about healthy living, disease prevention, and the importance of early detection, we can considerably lessen the strain on healthcare services. For example, initiatives promoting vaccinations, routine health check-ups, and nutritious eating can ward off illnesses and decrease the necessity for expensive treatments. Additionally, preventative approaches like screenings and early interventions enable the identification of health issues at an initial stage, rendering treatments simpler and more cost-effective.Moreover, funding health education and preventative measures can deliver economic advantages as well. A healthier population tends to be more productive, and lower healthcare expenses can result in substantial savings for individuals, businesses, and the government. Prioritizing funds for health education and preventative efforts can also help mitigate health disparities, as marginalized communities frequently face barriers to healthcare access and are at a higher risk for health challenges.Nonetheless, it is crucial to maintain a balance between treatment and prevention. Redirecting too much funding away from treatment may leave unresolved health issues, potentially increasing morbidity and mortality rates. Despite this, I contend that allocating a significant share of the health budget to health education and preventive measures represents a prudent investment in the long-term health and prosperity of a nation’s populace. By emphasizing prevention, countries can foster a healthier, more productive, and sustainable healthcare system.
376;University education should be restricted to the very besst academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;The idea that access to university education should be limited to only the highest-performing academic students has ignited a passionate debate. While some believe this approach guarantees the quality of higher education, I strongly oppose it. Restricting university access solely to top academic performers would have significant repercussions, stifling social mobility and worsening inequality.On one hand, it is true that universities face resource constraints, and focusing on the most talented students might yield improved academic outcomes. However, this perspective fails to appreciate the wide array of skills and talents that various students can offer. Many individuals who may not shine in traditional academic settings possess remarkable creative, practical, or entrepreneurial abilities that hold intrinsic value.Furthermore, limiting university access would reinforce a cycle of privilege, benefiting mainly those from wealthy backgrounds who have enjoyed superior education and resources. This would fundamentally undermine the ideals of meritocracy and social mobility, where anyone can enhance their socio-economic standing through effort and commitment. Rather than restricting access, universities ought to cultivate a diverse and inclusive atmosphere that allows students from all walks of life to learn and thrive together.In conclusion, while I recognize the need to uphold academic standards, I firmly advocate for making university education available to a broad spectrum of young individuals, irrespective of their academic performance. This approach can promote a more equitable and dynamic society, enabling individuals to explore their unique talents and contribute positively to the community. Ultimately, the advantages of a diverse and inclusive university education system greatly outweigh the potential downsides of limiting access to only the highest achievers.
377;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answerÊ;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children's education. Indeed, children grow up with two important people, their parents and teachers, and both are important in children's development. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects. In the first place, school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education. For instance, to be able to obtain the teacher certificates, people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge. However, in comparison to teachers, parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children's subjects such as mathematics and physics.Furthermore, teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children's communication skills. For example, after many years of teaching experience, teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries, facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills. By contrast, parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way. Last but not least, compared with teachers, parents do not have enough time to spend with their children. Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work, hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children. Thus, it was impossible for them to be a good teacher.In conclusion, teachers are the best for children's education. Not only do they contribute much to children's professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world.;"I completely support the idea that ""Parents are the best teachers."" From an early age, children look to their parents as role models, absorbing important lessons along the way. Parents have a unique ability to mold their child's morals, values, and behaviors, which makes them incredibly effective educators.One major reason why parents excel as teachers is their in-depth understanding of their child's strengths, weaknesses, and preferred learning styles. This insight allows them to customize their approach, offering tailored support that meets their child's specific needs. For instance, if a parent identifies that their child learns best through visual aids, they can adjust their teaching methods to include images, diagrams, and videos.In addition, parents equip their children with essential life skills—like responsibility, diligence, and empathy—through practical experience and everyday situations. For example, by giving their child chores or involving them in caring for a pet, a parent can instill a sense of responsibility. These real-world lessons are priceless and cannot be effectively conveyed in a traditional classroom environment.Moreover, parents have a significant impact on their child's emotional and social growth. They help their children navigate relationships, manage their emotions, and build self-confidence. A parent's unwavering love and support create a safe space for a child to explore, make mistakes, and learn from those experiences.In summary, parents are crucial to their child's education and personal growth, solidifying their role as the best teachers. Their capacity to offer personalized instruction, impart vital life skills, and influence emotional and social development is unmatched. Therefore, I firmly assert that parents are indeed the best teachers, and their influence on a child's life is immeasurable."
378;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the increasing physical demands of human life, salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone. I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job. In the following paragraphs, some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively.On one hand, i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human' basic needs. More specifically, people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family's living needs such as food , clothes, accommodation, education, medication. It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries, for example, will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably. This is because they are doing what they love, their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths.On the other hand, i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working, we are likely to achieve success easily in that field. There are plenty of people, who are now really successful, have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers, dancers and painters. Besides, important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness, satisfaction of jobs, personal relationships, professional skills, working environment, managers and colleagues should not be underestimated. Finally, some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies.In conclusion, it is undeniable that income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers. Nonetheless, passion on jobs, in my opinion, can bring actual happiness and help us get promoted in working to earn even more money later on.;When evaluating a job offer, many people tend to view salary as the most crucial element. However, I only partially agree with this viewpoint. Although a competitive salary is certainly an essential aspect of any job, it isn't the only factor influencing people's decisions.On one hand, salary is vital, particularly in the current economic environment where living costs are steadily increasing. A solid salary helps meet basic needs and offers a sense of financial security. It also signifies the value an employer places on an employee's skills and contributions. Furthermore, a higher salary can lead to better opportunities for savings, personal growth, and future investments.On the other hand, various other factors can carry more weight than salary alone. Job satisfaction, for example, greatly affects an individual's overall well-being and happiness. A position that provides personal fulfillment, avenues for professional development, and a healthy work-life balance may be more desirable than one that simply offers a high paycheck. Additionally, elements such as company culture, the work environment, and the chance to make a meaningful difference can greatly affect one's job selection.In summary, while salary is an important consideration when applying for a job, it isn't the only factor, and its significance can differ widely among individuals. Other elements like personal fulfillment, opportunities for growth, and the work environment are also crucial. Ultimately, a balanced approach considering these factors is most important, ensuring that the job provides not just financial stability but also enhances an individual’s overall quality of life and job satisfaction.
379;The burning of oil for transportation, especially in private cars, is wasteful and environmentally irresponsible. Taxation on petrol and diesel fuel should be increased to very high levels to discourage the use of private cars. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;There is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced. However, cars themselves, especially private ones, have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption. While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion.One can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile. Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries. Additionally, for those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities.However, taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation. To be precise, the more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable. Consequently, people have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis.Another point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially. Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support, other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them. America, for example, has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil.To summarize, higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons. However, it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues, making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars.;The proposal to raise taxes on petrol and diesel fuel to very high levels in order to discourage private car usage is a controversial topic. I am in favor of this idea since it aims to combat environmental damage caused by oil consumption for transportation. Emissions from private vehicles significantly contribute to air pollution, climate change, and other ecological issues. By increasing fuel taxes, the government could deter people from relying on private cars, thereby decreasing harmful emissions and fostering a cleaner environment.However, I also have reservations about this approach. While higher taxes may reduce private car usage, they could impose a heavy financial burden on low-income families who depend on these vehicles for their daily travel. Additionally, there’s no guarantee that the increased tax revenue will be allocated to enhancing public transportation, which is essential for discouraging private vehicle use. Without significant investments in alternatives like buses, trains, and cycling infrastructure, individuals may lack practical options other than private cars, limiting the effectiveness of this policy.In summary, I recognize the necessity of reducing private car usage to protect the environment, but I believe that raising fuel taxes should be accompanied by investments in public transportation and other alternatives. This strategy would provide people with viable transportation options, thus making the policy more effective and fair. While I partially support the tax increase, it must be integrated into a comprehensive transportation policy that emphasizes sustainability and social justice.
380;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society. I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs.First of all, we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself. As a result, criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs. Thus, citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally. Moreover, while on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns. Therefore, a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one.Secondly, police force carries guns only in high crime societies. Hence, people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime's categories such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, arson. Obviously, Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence.In conclusion, from the above views, although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary, it will bring the higher level of violence. Additionally, the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians' lives.;The idea that armed police contribute to increased violence in society is a subject of ongoing discussion. While some believe that having firearms within law enforcement heightens violence, I only partially concur with this viewpoint.On one side, the presence of guns can provoke greater tension and aggression in potentially dangerous situations. The visibility of firearms may escalate conflicts, as individuals might feel threatened or intimidated, increasing the chances of violent encounters. Moreover, the availability of weapons can foster a culture that prioritizes the use of firepower over de-escalation strategies, which could lead to unnecessary tragedies.Conversely, it is important to acknowledge that the primary function of the police is to maintain law and order, and in many instances, firearms can act as a deterrent to crime. In areas with high crime rates or significant safety threats, a lack of guns among police could endanger officers and hinder their ability to enforce the law effectively. Additionally, competent and well-trained police forces can utilize firearms in ways that minimize harm and enhance public safety.In summary, while I recognize that the presence of firearms in policing can contribute to increased violence in certain situations, I do not fully agree that it is a major cause of societal violence. It is vital for law enforcement to be thoroughly trained in firearm use and to emphasize de-escalation methods to prevent unnecessary conflict. Ultimately, a measured approach that takes into account the unique needs and context of each community is essential in determining the appropriate role of firearms in law enforcement.
381;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? With the help of technology, students nowadays can learn more information and learn it more quickly. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life. In education, it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances. From my viewpoint, the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students' progress.To start with, since technology was introduced, student have been exposed to a wide range of information, which neccessarily broaden their minds. The internet, for example, provide knowledge in the form of news, radio talks, tapes or reseachs on any particular fields. There, the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide.Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning. The modern world provides learners with the mp3, the mobile phone or the laptop that help them, especially language learners, listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime. Therefore, students will develop their skills at a greater pace. Moreover, the internet again, is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids, such as educational games, sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly.On balance, I have to consent to the use of technology in education, as it expedites data availability and accelarates students' learning process. It is highly recommended that apart from education, technology should be applied in every aspect of life which assures of a better future.;I wholeheartedly agree that technology has significantly enhanced students' ability to learn more efficiently and effectively today. It has transformed the educational landscape, granting students unprecedented access to a multitude of learning resources.A key factor in this enhancement is technology’s capacity for providing immediate access to extensive information. The internet serves as a rich repository of educational materials, including e-books, articles, and dedicated websites. With just a few clicks, students can find study guides, tutorials, and online courses, simplifying the process of grasping new ideas and solidifying their understanding of challenging topics. Platforms like Khan Academy and Coursera, for instance, offer an assortment of courses and lectures from esteemed universities around the globe, allowing learners to benefit from the expertise of leading professionals in various fields.Furthermore, technology promotes interactive and captivating learning experiences. Educational apps and software present information in dynamic and engaging formats, such as quizzes, games, and simulations. This approach not only enhances enjoyment but also boosts student engagement and information retention. For instance, language learning applications like Duolingo employ gamification and interactive tasks to teach languages, making the educational journey both enjoyable and effective.In summary, technology has profoundly reshaped the way we learn, allowing students to tap into a vast pool of information and accelerate their learning processes. By offering instant access to educational resources, fostering interactive learning, and personalizing educational experiences, technology has become an essential component of modern education. As it continues to advance, its influence on improving learning outcomes is bound to expand further.
382;Human have made a great technological process in the last hundred years. However, this progress has negative effects on people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;It is undeniable that technological process has brought numerous benefits making human life become more and more comfortable and easy. Some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives. I personally disagree with this view. In the following paragraphs, both sides of the above matter as well as my own view's explanations would be analyzed and given, respectively.Firstly, it is undoubtedly that thanks to modern technology invented recently, human life has been improved dramatically. Air-conditioners, computers, cellphones, washing machines, for example, is likely to be seen as greatest inventions helping people to reduce stress and time for other activities. Moreover, applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients' lives.However, some negative aspects of technological process need to be mentioned clearly. In spite of bring fantastic advantages, technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process. This is because exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously. Last but not least, technology may decrease a great deal of creativity in certain groups of people especially children and the youth due to the dependence upon available achievements.In conclusion, I totally believe that technology has a great contribution to our lives and civilization. We can not neglect profound impact of great technological process on human life. Nonetheless, its adverse effects need controlling more reasonably.;Over the past century, we have experienced remarkable technological advancements that have transformed many facets of human existence. Although these innovations have enhanced the quality of life for many, it is essential to recognize their negative repercussions as well. I hold the view that while technological progress offers significant advantages, it also brings adverse effects to people's lives.On one side, the positive impacts of technology are undeniable. The advent of the internet, for example, has revolutionized global communication, broadened access to information, and streamlined international trade. Breakthroughs in medicine have not only extended human lifespans but also greatly improved healthcare quality. Moreover, advancements in transportation have made travel faster, more affordable, and increasingly convenient.Conversely, there are notable downsides to these advancements. A growing dependence on technology has contributed to sedentary lifestyles, which are linked to rising obesity rates and related health issues. The pervasive use of social media has been associated with heightened stress levels, shorter attention spans, and feelings of isolation. Additionally, the environmental repercussions of technological production and waste disposal are serious concerns, as electronic waste poses a major threat to our planet.In summary, while I recognize the vast benefits brought by technological advancements, it is crucial to address the accompanying negative effects on individuals' lives. It is imperative that individuals, governments, and corporations collaborate to alleviate the adverse consequences of these developments. By adopting a balanced perspective on technology, we can maximize its advantages while minimizing its drawbacks. Ultimately, a thoughtful and sustainable approach to technological progress is vital for fostering a better future for all of humanity.
383;There is a large amount of violence in television programs we should reduce. Do you agree or disagree?;"Excessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society. Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today. Personally, I believe that governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable. Admittedly, reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate. However, in order to tackle this problem more effectively, governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children’s television programs. As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. Little wonder, then, that by watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes. Therefore, it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies.Nevertheless, it would certainly be a violation of adults’ civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences. Frequently, adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day. For whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment. Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them. In conclusion, it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency; however, the adults should not be the victim of this policy.";"The prevalence of violence in television shows has emerged as a significant concern in recent years. I firmly believe that the high levels of violence depicted in these programs need to be curbed. Exposure to violent content can have detrimental effects, especially on children and young adults. Studies indicate that continuous exposure to violent media can result in aggressive behavior, a desensitization to violence, and a decline in empathy.Additionally, the portrayal of violence on television can reinforce harmful stereotypes and glamorize aggressive behavior. This can significantly affect societal norms and values, fostering a culture of violence and hostility. The overwhelming presence of violent content may also render viewers emotionally numb, leading them to be less reactive to the seriousness of violent acts and more likely to regard them as commonplace.Mitigating violence on television is not just a moral obligation; it is also a vital step toward fostering a more compassionate and peaceful society. This can be accomplished through stricter regulations on television content and by raising awareness among viewers about the potential impacts of violent programming. Furthermore, television networks and producers can contribute by promoting uplifting and positive content that emphasizes empathy, kindness, and peaceful conflict resolution.In summary, the excessive violence portrayed on television is a critical issue that demands prompt action. By reducing violence in media, we can foster a more positive and peaceful viewing environment that upholds healthy values and behaviors. It is our shared duty to ensure that television programming embodies the principles of empathy, kindness, and non-violence, which are essential for cultivating a better society."
384;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world. Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act. Personally, I tend to disagree with this statement, while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence.On the one hand, I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun. An obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him. Obviously, police officers can force a criminal to surrender, because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public. As a result, some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence.On the other hand, there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities. Firstly, the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries. Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably. Secondly, cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs. Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance.In conclusion, it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence. However, some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment. In my view, the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act.;The idea that the presence of firearms within law enforcement contributes to increased violence in society is a debated topic. Some contend that armed police can deter and effectively respond to violent acts, while others argue that this can lead to an escalation of violence and foster an aggressive culture. I partially agree with the viewpoint that police officers carrying guns may contribute to higher levels of societal violence.On one side, it is reasonable to suggest that the visibility of firearms can increase the likelihood of their usage, potentially leading to more violent incidents. For example, in nations where law enforcement is armed, there have been reports of police misconduct and excessive force, which can fuel violence and erode public trust in the police. Moreover, the mere presence of guns might encourage conflicts to be resolved through violence rather than through de-escalation.Conversely, I believe the connection between armed police and societal violence is more intricate and influenced by various factors, including the training and conduct of officers, as well as the cultural and social environment of the communities they serve. In some contexts, the existence of armed police may be viewed as essential for protecting citizens from significant threats, and the use of firearms may be tightly regulated to prevent misuse.In summary, while there may be a link between armed police forces and heightened levels of violence, this relationship is not simply one of cause and effect. The influence of police carrying firearms on societal violence is shaped by numerous factors, including policing methods, community dynamics, and societal values. Therefore, a nuanced approach that takes these complexities into account is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of this issue.
385;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child's success in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"It goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted. Their success should be attributed to many different external factors. It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments. However, in my opinion, the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements.To begin with, the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children. In high school, for instance, an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same. From a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children, which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children's academic performances.To add up, when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such, classmates are second to none. It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents, explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others; it can be, for example, lessons on the class, social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents. Sharing the same age, children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas, to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments, resulting in deeper comprehension.All advantages considered, classmates are unrivalled by the children's parents as they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion, two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school.";I contest the claim that classmates have a greater influence than parents on a child's academic success. While peers can certainly affect a child's performance and social growth, I contend that parents play a more crucial role in determining their child's achievements in school.To begin with, parents are key in creating a supportive and nurturing environment that cultivates a passion for learning and encourages academic success. They inspire their children to work diligently, persist through challenges, and pursue excellence—qualities that are vital for scholastic achievement. Moreover, parents often take an active role in their child's education by attending parent-teacher meetings, assisting with homework, and reinforcing classroom lessons.On the other hand, while classmates can offer positive reinforcement, they also have the potential to distract or negatively influence one another. For instance, if a child is in a group that does not prioritize education or engages in disruptive antics, it may hinder their focus and motivation. Additionally, the influence of parents tends to be more enduring, while classmates can change frequently from year to year.Furthermore, studies indicate that parental engagement is a strong predictor of academic success. Children with involved parents typically exhibit better attendance, higher grades, and greater academic motivation. In summary, although classmates can impact a child's educational journey, I maintain that parents are the more significant influence. They establish a foundation of support, values, and encouragement that is essential for academic success and future endeavors.
386;Living in big cities is bad for people's health. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, more and more people are moving to big cities to live. However, while life in those cities is good in some ways, I completely argue that people's health would therefore be affected negatively.Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before. Exhaust from transportation, especially cars, and factories' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases. Besides, water pollution makes people's health become more critical. The fact is that dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people's bodies and create severe problems, which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time. Moreover, it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink. Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today's market. Also, overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases, especially cough, sneezing and illness. Furthermore, living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas. Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary, pickpocketing, trickery, vandalism, smuggling or even murder. Earning money for living becomes more difficult, living healthy in such places is getting harder also.In conclusion, I believe that life in big cities can have negative effects on people's health. Thus, both government and individual should take steps to diminish the consequences involved.;The debate over whether living in large cities adversely affects people's health continues to be a contentious topic. While there are compelling arguments supporting this view, there are also many counterpoints that indicate the connection between urban living and health is nuanced. Personally, I find myself partially agreeing with the assertion.On one side, life in big cities can lead to negative consequences for both physical and mental well-being. Factors such as high air pollution, noise pollution, and the stress inherent in urban environments can contribute to a variety of health issues, including respiratory ailments, heart disease, and mental health conditions. In addition, the fast-paced and frequently sedentary lifestyles of city residents can result in obesity and other health problems related to lifestyle choices. For example, the scarcity of green spaces and recreational facilities in urban areas can diminish opportunities for physical activity, worsening these issues.Conversely, large cities also provide various health advantages that may not be present in rural settings. Cities generally host advanced medical facilities, specialized healthcare providers, and a broad spectrum of health services, facilitating residents' access to high-quality medical care. Moreover, urban locations often feature a diverse array of healthy food options, including organic groceries and specialty shops, which can support better eating habits. Cities also tend to offer more chances for social engagement, a vital component for maintaining mental health and overall well-being.In summary, while there are certain health risks associated with urban living, the situation is not entirely negative. The presence of quality healthcare services, diverse food choices, and opportunities for social interaction can outweigh the drawbacks. Nevertheless, it is crucial for city planners and policymakers to prioritize the development of green spaces, the reduction of pollution, and initiatives that encourage physical activity and mental health support in order to lessen the detrimental effects of urban living. By doing this, cities can evolve into healthier and more sustainable environments for their residents.
387;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society. To some extent, I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control. First of all, it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime. However, this is not as simple as it sounds. In fact, stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally. People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control. Moreover, there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens. As a result, the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself. Therefore, if a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes. All in all, it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate. On the other hand, criminal mind seems to be more related to violence. Consequently, we should pay more attention to adjust people's behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control.;The debate surrounding the impact of arming police forces on societal violence is a complex and controversial one. While some contend that equipping law enforcement with firearms can escalate conflicts and foster a culture of aggression, I find myself partially in agreement with this perspective.On one hand, the presence of guns can indeed lead to a more aggressive policing style. Armed officers may be more inclined to use their weapons in high-pressure situations, potentially resulting in increased violence and casualties. This scenario can create a cycle where weapons are present on both sides of law enforcement-citizen encounters, raising the chances of violent outcomes. Additionally, the sight of firearms can instill fear and distrust among the public, eroding the bond between law enforcement and the communities they aim to protect.Conversely, it is crucial to take into account the context in which firearms are utilized and their role in maintaining public safety. In many areas, the main goal of arming police is to safeguard both officers and civilians from significant threats. In scenarios where lives are genuinely at risk, having access to firearms can be a vital means for law enforcement to manage and defuse potentially dangerous situations without escalating violence further. Furthermore, the training officers receive often stresses de-escalation and responsible use of force, indicating that the mere existence of guns does not automatically lead to higher violence levels.In summary, while I acknowledge that arming police could lead to increased violence under certain circumstances, this is not a universal rule. The relationship between armed law enforcement and societal violence is intricate and shaped by numerous factors, such as policing practices, community dynamics, and the specific details of each event. Thus, a thoughtful and context-aware approach is essential in assessing the effects of firearms on societal violence.
388;Education is the single most important factor in the development of a country. Do you agree?;Education is undeniably an economic necessity. In most countries, it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly. In highly industrialized countries, undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all. I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country.In a developing country, not many can afford to send their children to school. There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities. They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands. These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen, can hardly eat three meals a day, let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday. As a result, these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents.Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors, lawyers or engineers. Basic education teaches one child to read and write. Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information. A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient. A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment. In the same way, a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society. Collectively, the benefits of education can make a man, a society and a developed country.In conclusion, education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country. The more people in the country become educated, the better chance it can develop.;I wholeheartedly believe that education is the most critical factor in a country's development. It plays a vital role in shaping a nation's future by equipping individuals with essential knowledge, skills, and the ability to think critically. A well-educated populace is crucial for driving a nation's economic, social, and political progress.Education allows individuals to gain the skills and knowledge necessary to secure higher-paying jobs, which not only enhances their quality of life but also supports the nation’s economic advancement. Additionally, education encourages innovation, entrepreneurship, and technological progress—elements that are key for maintaining competitiveness in the global marketplace. Educated citizens are more inclined to engage in the democratic process, make informed choices, and hold their leaders accountable, thus fostering good governance and political stability.Moreover, education significantly contributes to social development. It enhances social mobility, alleviates poverty and inequality, and leads to better healthcare outcomes. People with education are typically more likely to adopt healthy lifestyles, engage in family planning, and seek medical attention when necessary, which helps reduce mortality rates and improve overall health and well-being.While factors like infrastructure, natural resources, and institutions also play significant roles in a country’s development, education serves as the foundation for all development efforts. Without a skilled and educated workforce, a country’s potential for growth and advancement remains severely constrained. In conclusion, education is the single most important factor in a country’s development, exerting a multiplier effect on economic, social, and political growth, and is essential for fostering a prosperous, stable, and equitable society. Thus, it is imperative for governments and policymakers to prioritize education by investing in education infrastructure, teacher training, and student support services to harness the benefits of a well-educated and skilled populace.
389;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this sets a bad example for young people. To what extent to you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth. To some extent, I do not agree with this statement.First of all, it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people. We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone, especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off. However, the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles. They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them. Therefore, it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills. Moreover, it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities' world without any talents or achievements. We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows, for example; The Voice, X Factor or Next Top Models etc. As a result, to become a star and an inspiration for people, a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates. Thus, only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore, it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters. In conclusion, people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation. That is the reason why celebrities nowadays give more good influence on young people than they were previously.";The idea that celebrities are better known for their glamour and wealth than their actual achievements has ignited significant debate in recent years. While some contend that this trend negatively influences young audiences, the situation is more nuanced. In this essay, I will explore the extent of my agreement or disagreement with this assertion.On one hand, it is clear that celebrities’ lives are frequently depicted in ways that highlight their luxurious lifestyles and striking appearances. The relentless stream of images and narratives in the media that focus on their wealth and glamour can establish unrealistic expectations and foster a culture of materialism among youth. This may result in some young individuals placing undue importance on fame and fortune rather than on hard work and genuine accomplishments.Conversely, I believe it is unfair to lay the blame solely at the feet of celebrities. The media and society also contribute significantly to the perpetuation of this culture. Additionally, numerous celebrities actively utilize their platforms to advocate for social issues, support charitable efforts, and inspire the youth through their talents and achievements. For example, figures like Leonardo DiCaprio and Angelina Jolie are celebrated not only for their fame but also for their charitable endeavors and commitment to social and environmental causes.In conclusion, while it is accurate that certain celebrities are more recognized for their glamour and wealth, I assert that this is not the sole dimension of their popularity. Many celebrities strive to make a constructive difference, and it is the responsibility of the media and the public to encourage a more balanced perspective on success. Ultimately, young people should be motivated to admire role models who exemplify a blend of achievement, diligence, and social responsibility.
390;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to whether or not mobiles phones have negative effects on our social life. Indeed, mobile phones have widely been used by people of all ages. However, I believe, this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society.In the first place, spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills. For example, as people, especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones, they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends, and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children's eyesight and physical posture. As a result, it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently.Furthermore, the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development. For instance, there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature. In these games, children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players, and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviors. Consequently, frequent conflicts may occur during communication.However, we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints. Mobile phones , such as smart phones, has made our communication easy and convenience. The reason is that, as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones, people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge. Thus, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication. To sum up, although mobile phones make our communication faster, it also gives rise to many social problems such as children's social skills and their mental health. Therefore, i highly advocate that we should use mobile phone in moderation in order to avoid these serious problems.;The introduction of mobile phones has transformed communication, igniting a lively discussion about technology's influence on social interactions. While some claim that mobile phones undermine face-to-face connections, I hold a different perspective.On one side, it's true that mobile phones can interfere with direct interactions. People often find themselves more engaged with their devices than with those around them, which can diminish the quality of meaningful conversations and foster feelings of loneliness, even in busy environments. Additionally, the prevalence of social media encourages a culture of curated online identities, eclipsing authentic human relationships.Conversely, mobile phones have introduced innovative avenues for social engagement that were previously inconceivable. For example, social media and messaging platforms allow individuals to remain connected with loved ones regardless of distance. They also facilitate the creation of online communities based on shared interests, enabling individuals to interact with others who share their passions. Moreover, mobile phones provide access to a wealth of social resources, including support groups and online counseling, which can be particularly advantageous for those who find in-person interactions challenging.In summary, while mobile phones can pose challenges to social interaction, I believe their advantages significantly outweigh the negatives. By using mobile phones thoughtfully and remaining aware of our online activities, we can leverage technology to enhance our social connections rather than diminish them. Ultimately, mobile phones are merely tools, and it is our responsibility to employ them in ways that foster meaningful relationships and community engagement.
391;The environment problems facing today's world are so great that there is little ordinary people can do to improve the situation. Government and large companies should be responsible for reducing the amount of damage being done to the environment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Nowadays, many countries are concerned with the environment problems. There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that. Personally, I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment, but we need to analyze some specific situations.On one hand, solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies, and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems. For example, air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries, and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution, while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances. However, individuals are unable to cope with these things.Besides, the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people. It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection. This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society, and the government controls many influential media, such as TV stations and newspapers, which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens.On the other hand, it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection, and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment. For instance, many people driving private cars could cause air pollution, and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment. If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities, this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement.In conclusion, the government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues, but every citizen also can contribute to the environment.;The belief that everyday individuals have minimal influence on addressing environmental issues has ignited significant discussion. Although it is undeniable that governments and large corporations play critical roles in diminishing environmental harm, the perception that individual efforts lack significance is misguided. I partially disagree with this notion, emphasizing the collective impact of personal actions and the importance of a comprehensive strategy for environmental sustainability.On one side, it is true that governments and major companies hold considerable accountability for mitigating environmental damage. They possess the resources, infrastructure, and regulatory authority necessary to enact large-scale initiatives that can greatly decrease pollution, environmental degradation, and greenhouse gas emissions. For example, governments can impose stricter environmental policies, and businesses can implement sustainable practices and technologies. Their efforts can significantly influence the environment, establish benchmarks, and shape consumer behavior.However, the collective impact of individual actions should not be overlooked. Actions such as conserving energy, recycling, utilizing public transportation, or choosing sustainable products may seem trivial in isolation, but when adopted by millions, these behaviors can drive meaningful change. Furthermore, individual actions can shift societal attitudes towards environmental issues, fostering a culture of sustainability and generating public pressure for policy reforms.In summary, while the roles of governments and large corporations are essential in combating environmental degradation, the contributions of ordinary people must not be underestimated. Effectively addressing the environmental challenges we face today requires a blend of policy reform, corporate accountability, and individual commitment. Thus, a collaborative effort that encompasses all sectors of society is vital for confronting the complexity and scale of environmental problems.
392;Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society, so this kind of information should be restricted on media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Nowadays, the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes. Personally, I believe such details should be strictly censored, if not banned altogether.It is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating. These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is, more often than that, to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings. Consequently, a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated or fraudulent, which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes.An even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise. This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans, avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police. Thus, without the prevention on criminal details, the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken.Most importantly, particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced. Without their consent, this could only add to theses innocent people's mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions.In conclusion, I strongly hold my point that any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer, as they may be false, may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes.;The issue of whether detailed crime descriptions in newspapers and on television can negatively impact society and should thus be regulated is a subject of continuous discussion. While I recognize the rationale behind this viewpoint, I only partially concur.On one hand, it is true that in-depth crime reporting can lead to adverse effects on society. For example, such portrayals can foster unwarranted fear and anxiety among the public, particularly when they involve violent or distressing incidents. Furthermore, these reports can potentially incite copycat crimes or encourage susceptible individuals to partake in similar illegal activities. Additionally, the families and victims involved may endure further emotional pain and trauma due to this explicit coverage.Conversely, imposing restrictions on this type of information could compromise the values of press freedom and the public's right to access information. The media plays an essential role in educating the public about significant issues, including crime, which can enhance awareness and possibly prevent future offenses. Detailed coverage can also act as a deterrent by emphasizing the serious repercussions of criminal behavior. Moreover, such reporting can place pressure on authorities to enhance their crime response and interventions.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the potential drawbacks of extensive crime descriptions in media outlets, I do not fully support the idea of restricting this information. Instead, I advocate for finding a middle ground between keeping the public informed and protecting vulnerable individuals. Media organizations should practice responsibility and sensitivity in their reporting, avoiding unnecessary or exploitative content. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the media to deliver news in a manner that is both informative and respectful, minimizing harm while upholding the public's right to information.
393;Some people say that in our modern age, it is unnecessary to teach children about the skills of handwriting. To what extent do you agree or disagree;In this age of modern technology, some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children. To some people, it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task. From my point of view, children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting for several reasons.Despite the convenience from up-to-date facilities, handwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning. Firstly, this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes, doing homework and writing. It enables to improve learners' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well. Under the guidance of parents or teachers, children can benefit from practicing handwriting. This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content, elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities.Secondly, parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance. The fact is that kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons. It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works. Moreover, the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills. For example, with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word, learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes. To conclude, no matter how fast and convenient modern devices bring to us in writing, handwriting is still a needed skill for all of people, especially students at the early age.;The debate over the necessity of teaching handwriting skills to children in today’s digital world has become quite intense. While some contend that handwriting has become redundant due to advancements in technology, I firmly believe this is not the case. Handwriting is still a crucial skill that offers a variety of advantages for children's cognitive, academic, and personal growth.To begin with, handwriting improves literacy skills, including reading and writing comprehension. Research has indicated that children who engage in handwriting practice tend to retain and comprehend written material more effectively. Additionally, handwriting is closely associated with brain development, particularly in regions linked to language and memory. By honing their handwriting skills, children also enhance their fine motor abilities, which contribute to overall coordination and dexterity.Furthermore, handwriting fosters creativity, self-expression, and individuality. In a time when digital communication prevails, handwritten notes offer a distinct avenue for children to express their thoughts, feelings, and ideas in a personal and meaningful manner. Handwritten work is often viewed as more genuine and valuable, reflecting the author’s effort and uniqueness.While it is undeniable that technology plays a significant role in modern life and typing skills are important, it would be premature to overlook the significance of handwriting entirely. Numerous professions, such as art, design, and education, still depend on handwriting and hand-drawn illustrations. Moreover, in situations where technology fails or is unavailable, handwriting remains a crucial means of communication.In summary, I believe that teaching handwriting skills to children is still vital in our contemporary world. The advantages of handwriting—ranging from enhanced literacy and cognitive development to greater creativity and self-expression—underscore its importance as a skill that should continue to be taught and fostered in schools. This approach will help ensure that children grow into well-rounded, capable, and expressive individuals, ready to thrive in all areas of life.
394;Families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable. However, I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential.Firstly, by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor. It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course. With the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life.Secondly, the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital. Obviously, this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation; therefore, the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue. In addition, the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care.Many parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them. They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use. Nevertheless, we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade. We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes.On the whole, I do believe that taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in.";"The idea that families who choose private schooling for their children should be exempt from taxes that fund the public education system is a highly debated topic. Some believe it’s unjust to require these families to finance a system they don’t use, while others argue that education is a public good that serves the entire society, and thus, everyone should share the cost.I largely disagree with this viewpoint. One key reason for my position is that the state education system provides benefits beyond individual users; it positively impacts society as a whole. An educated population fosters economic development, social unity, and active citizenship, among other advantages. By supporting the public education system, taxpayers are investing in the future of their community, irrespective of whether they have children enrolled. Moreover, public schools are essential in educating those who cannot afford private schooling, helping to decrease inequality and enhance social mobility.Moreover, allowing private school families to opt out of funding the public education system could create a dual system, where those who can afford private education disengage from supporting public schools, thereby threatening their quality and accessibility. This could intensify existing disparities in education and within society.In summary, while the rationale for exempting private school families from taxes that support the public education system may appear reasonable from an individual standpoint, we must consider the wider societal advantages of public education. It is fair to ask all taxpayers to contribute to this system to maintain a strong and inclusive educational framework that benefits the entire community."
395;Government investment in the arts, such as music and theatre, is a waste of money. Governments must invest this money in public services instead. To what extent do you agree with this statement?;There has been wide opinion that Government should invest more money on public services rather than arts such as music and theatre. However, in my perspective, both public services and arts worth investment.It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing. Investing in hospitals helps improve people's health, also, in schools assists with raising our children's education level. Apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately, our standard of living would deteriorate.But our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts. Arts include many forms and music as well as cinema are the most typical. These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy. The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment, for instance K-pop and Hollywood, and these industries can not survive without goverment's financial assistance. The long and the short of it, both arts and public services are important to the community and should be invested properly.;"I take issue with the notion that government funding for the arts is a wasteful expenditure. While it is undeniable that public services are crucial and necessitate considerable financial support, the arts are integral to a country’s social, cultural, and economic advancement. Investment in the arts—such as music and theater—offers numerous advantages, including the promotion of cultural diversity, the preservation of national heritage, and the encouragement of creativity and innovation.Additionally, the arts sector significantly contributes to the economy by generating revenue and creating employment opportunities. Research indicates that each dollar invested in the arts can yield several times that amount in economic activity. The arts also boost tourism, attracting visitors who come specifically to engage with cultural events and performances.While prioritizing public services is important, it is not an either-or situation; both sectors can be funded effectively. A balanced approach that supports investment in both public services and the arts can result in a more comprehensive and sustainable progression for society. Moreover, the arts can enhance public services like education and healthcare by offering therapeutic and educational advantages.In summary, although public services are vital, government investment in the arts is not a waste. The arts significantly enrich the economy, foster cultural diversity, and positively influence society. Instead of viewing public services and the arts as opposing interests, governments should aim for a balanced investment strategy that fosters a vibrant, diverse, and prosperous society. This ensures that citizens have access to a broad spectrum of cultural, social, and economic opportunities."
396;It is inevitable that as technology advances, traditional cultures will be lost. It seems that we cannot have these two things together. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, technology has been developing significantly, impacting many aspects of our life. While there is belief that technology advances means a lost in traditional cultures, I would argue that although the affect of technology on culture is undeniable, it has also contributed to the preservation of traditonal culture.Thanks to modern technology, our life has been improved with many gadgets. The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working, it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries. However, these newfangled practices has replaced many old traditional ones. For instance, factories equipped with new and highly-productive system has replaced old handmade products, the exchange of letters among friends is so hard to be seen as we have had emails and social network instead, new video games has superseded the old-physical ones. Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology.However, despite the drawback mentioned above, technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways. Internet has aided to assess the young generations to the cultural identity of many nations from all around the world. With the help of advanced methods, many art masterpiece has been well restorated and well preserved. Modern devices also assist the scientists to study the ancient societies much more deeply, hence discovering more cultural traces.To give a brief conclusion, Modern technogy has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways.;The belief that technological progress and traditional cultures cannot coexist has ignited significant debate. While some claim that the relentless advancement of technology threatens to eliminate traditional customs, it’s misleading to assume these two realms are inherently incompatible.On one hand, advancements in technology can indeed jeopardize traditional cultures. As individuals increasingly turn to digital platforms for entertainment, education, and social interaction, there’s a tangible risk that unique cultural practices and traditions may fade into obscurity. For example, the rise of social media has contributed to a decline in traditional storytelling and folk music within certain communities. Furthermore, the global interchangeability of cultures, driven by technological links, can lead to a diminished sense of distinct cultural identities.Conversely, technology can also serve as a valuable ally in preserving and promoting traditional cultures. Digital archives, online museums, and social media can grant a worldwide audience access to cultural heritage that was once beyond reach. Moreover, technology can aid in revitalizing endangered languages and traditions by bridging distances and enabling the exchange of knowledge and ideas. For instance, language learning applications and online programs can foster the preservation of indigenous languages and customs.In summary, even though technological advancements present challenges to traditional cultures, their complete disappearance is not an unavoidable fate. Through thoughtful strategies, cultural awareness, and creative approaches, technology can actively support and celebrate traditional customs rather than erase them. Ultimately, it is our responsibility to strike a balance between reaping the benefits of technological growth and preserving our rich cultural diversity. By finding this harmony, we can build a future where tradition and technology not only coexist but enhance each other.
397;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students to study in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty. Personally, I do not agree the viewpoint, because many different characters exist between male and female students.On one hand, boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality. Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases. For instance, there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world. Many boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts. Besides, girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter. This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect.Furthermore, it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender, and that does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development. For example, a girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department, but she is unlikely to focus on her subject, and this also can block the girl's future development and career prospect.On the other hand, universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities, and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects. It would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender.In conclusion, it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject.;The idea that universities should enroll equal numbers of male and female students in every discipline has ignited considerable debate. While promoting gender equality is a worthwhile goal, implementing such a policy is intricate and may be impractical. Personally, I have mixed feelings about this proposal.On one side, ensuring an equal representation of male and female students can help reduce the disparity in fields traditionally dominated by men, such as engineering and physics. This could create a more diverse and inclusive academic environment that stimulates innovative thinking and diverse viewpoints. Additionally, it might motivate women to pursue careers in areas where they have historically been underrepresented, thus advancing gender equality.Conversely, enforcing a strict quota could lead to discrimination against qualified candidates based on their gender instead of their academic capabilities. This practice could result in less competent students gaining admission over more qualified individuals simply to fulfill the quota, compromising the institution's academic standards. Moreover, disciplines like nursing and education have been predominantly female, and applying a quota could unduly limit opportunities for women in these areas.In summary, while advocating for gender equality in university admissions is commendable, a rigid approach requiring equal numbers of male and female students may not be the fairest or most effective method. A more nuanced approach that considers the unique needs and requirements of each discipline and institution would be preferable, ensuring that academic merit remains the primary criterion in the admissions process.
398;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Celebrities, for example movie stars, are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend, etc. It is human nature that people, especially youngsters, are attracted to the celebrities they favour, and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible. But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children.The first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard. This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living. Further more, they will not value other people's hard work and take everything for granted.Meanwhile, not all celebrities are role models. It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols, having messy sex lives. Worse still, without proper parenting, children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living.Of course, some celebrities, e.g. writers, passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children for they share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world.In conclusion, media should shift its focus from covering celebrities to elsewhere. Meanwhile, children's access to the celebrities news on the media should be restricted and they should study only from the celebrities who can act positively.;In recent years, concerns have arisen regarding the effect of celebrity media coverage on children. Many believe this extensive attention to the lives of celebrities negatively impacts young viewers, a stance I largely endorse.On one hand, the relentless focus on celebrity gossip and scandals can set unrealistic standards and foster materialistic attitudes in children. Young minds are particularly susceptible to influence, often seeing celebrities as role models. When children observe their idols engaging in questionable conduct, they may feel compelled to imitate such behavior, leading to a deterioration of their moral compass. Additionally, the celebrity culture's emphasis on physical appearance and wealth can contribute to issues with self-esteem and body image among young people.Conversely, some argue that celebrity coverage can inspire children to follow their passions or become socially conscious. For example, celebrities who champion social causes may encourage children to engage in charitable efforts. Nonetheless, I maintain that the negative repercussions of celebrity media coverage far outweigh the potential benefits.In summary, although there may be some advantages to celebrity coverage, I firmly believe that its detrimental effects on children are substantial. It is essential for parents, educators, and the media to collaborate in fostering a more balanced and positive portrayal of celebrities and their values, while also educating children about the potential downsides of celebrity culture. By taking these steps, we can help children develop a healthier and more realistic perception of the world around them. It is ultimately our duty to protect children from being unduly swayed by the often superficial and materialistic nature of celebrity culture.
399;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;"The phrase ""Prevention is better than cure"" implies that a considerable part of a nation's health budget should be dedicated to health education and preventive strategies instead of just treatment. I largely concur with this viewpoint, as investing in prevention can yield long-term advantages for individuals and the healthcare system overall.Preventive measures and health education can markedly decrease the prevalence of diseases, which, in turn, reduces the necessity for expensive treatments. For example, vaccination initiatives and public health campaigns can help curb the transmission of infectious diseases, while educational programs can encourage healthy lifestyles, thereby lowering the risk of chronic illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes. By reallocating resources to these areas, healthcare systems can mitigate the substantial costs associated with managing advanced disease stages.Additionally, emphasizing prevention can enhance the overall quality of life for individuals and communities. When health education is prioritized, individuals are better equipped to make informed choices about their health, enabling proactive measures to prevent illness. This proactive mindset can lead to a healthier and more productive workforce, ultimately driving economic growth for the country.Nonetheless, it is vital to strike a balance between prevention and treatment. Completely redirecting funds from treatment to prevention could negatively impact those who are already ill and in need of effective healthcare services. Therefore, a balanced strategy that provides financial support for both prevention and treatment is essential to address current health needs while also investing in the future well-being of the population.In summary, while a balanced approach is necessary, I believe that a substantial portion of a country's health budget should prioritize health education and preventive measures over treatment. This strategy can significantly lower the rates of disease, enhance quality of life, and contribute to a more sustainable healthcare system."
400;Fatherhood ought to be emphasized as much as motherhood. The idea that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies leads on to the idea that they are also responsible for bringing the children up. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families, the smallest component of the society. While mother's role is essential in a child's life, I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood.The first reason why the father's role should be equal to the mother's role is the nature of parantage. In my view, the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child's characteristics. For example, in a traditional Turkish family, while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child, a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child. The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today. In my opinion, we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life, including relationships. For instance, a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today's society. Instead, all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals. Therefore, I believe that having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity.In conclusion, fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships.;The belief that women alone bear the responsibility for deciding to have children and raising them is a deeply rooted stereotype in many cultures. This perspective is not only outdated but also unjust. It is crucial to highlight fatherhood alongside motherhood, as the responsibility of child-rearing is a shared endeavor between both parents.In contemporary society, the traditional nuclear family model has evolved significantly. As more women pursue careers and seek financial independence, it is increasingly unrealistic for them to take on the entire burden of childcare. Additionally, research indicates that active participation of fathers in parenting has a profoundly beneficial effect on children's cognitive, emotional, and social development.Promoting fatherhood to a degree equal to motherhood not only fosters equality but also acknowledges the essential role fathers play in their children's upbringing. This encouragement leads fathers to take a more hands-on approach to childcare, resulting in a more equitable division of parental responsibilities.Furthermore, highlighting the significance of fatherhood helps dismantle stereotypes and challenges societal norms that have historically relegated childcare to women. By recognizing and advocating for the importance of fatherhood, we can aspire to create a more inclusive and supportive family environment, where both parents contribute equally to their children's upbringing. In summary, the misconception that women alone are responsible for having and raising children must be challenged. By promoting fatherhood alongside motherhood, we can cultivate a more balanced and fair approach to parenting.
401;It is important that children should study hard at school. time spent playing sport is time wasted. to what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people believe that studying hard is essential part for children, otherwise others people think that playing sport is waste of time. In my point of view, both of studying hard and playing sports are part of life to children. On the other hand, studying hard will give children a better future. Studying hard gives children with a plenty of knowledge and skills for their future. Naturally, children will be growing up and looking for their job. For instance, children who always studying hard and getting high achievement, it will be easy to pass qualification for work and they are more likely to find great work at multinational company. If they working at multinational company as the result is they can earn higher salary. The message is when you always studying harder than others you will get best results.At the same time, playing sports will give good effects on children. There are many popular sports among children such as football, basketball, and volleyball. Also, there are many benefit when children doing sport. Firstly, children who always playing sport like football, they will be active as a person and learn to become team-player. It will be good for children, because indirectly they will learn how to socialize each other as a team. That will make children getting lots of friends, so they can contribute positively to community. Secondly, playing sport makes children getting healthy and become children's well-being. In conclusion, both studying hard at school and playing sports can improve children's future.;I firmly disagree with the notion that playing sports is a waste of time and that children should dedicate themselves exclusively to academics. While achieving good grades is undeniably important for a child's future, engaging in physical activity and sports is essential for their holistic development.Participation in sports not only boosts physical health and fitness but also fosters mental well-being, enhances teamwork and discipline. Children learn important life lessons such as perseverance, hard work, and how to handle both successes and setbacks. Additionally, sports provide opportunities for children to develop social skills, form friendships, and work collaboratively toward shared goals. These vital life competencies are just as crucial as academic knowledge and can significantly influence a child's future.Moreover, research indicates that physical activity can enhance cognitive function and academic performance. Exercise has been shown to improve concentration, memory, and problem-solving abilities—skills that are critical for success in the classroom. Thus, the issue is not a matter of choosing between academic study and sports, but rather finding a harmonious balance between the two.In summary, while academic diligence is certainly important, it is not the sole contributor to a child's development. Playing sports is a worthwhile investment of time, imparting essential life skills, enhancing both physical and mental health, and even boosting academic achievement. A well-rounded approach that embraces both educational pursuits and physical activity is vital for cultivating healthy, successful individuals.
