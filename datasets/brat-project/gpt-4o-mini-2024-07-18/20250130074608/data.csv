0;Some people think that children should be taught to compete, but others think that children should be taught to co-operate that become more useful adults. What do you think?;It is always said that competition can effectively promote the development of economy. In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.First of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.On the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.Consequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success.;The debate between teaching children to compete versus teaching them to cooperate is a significant one, touching on fundamental aspects of character development and future societal contributions. While both skills have their merits, I contend that fostering cooperation is more beneficial for children, as it cultivates well-rounded adults who can work collaboratively in an increasingly interconnected world.Competition can instill a sense of ambition and drive in children. It teaches them to set goals, strive for excellence, and develop resilience when faced with setbacks. On the other hand, an overemphasis on competition can lead to negative outcomes, such as anxiety, unhealthy rivalry, and an inability to work effectively within a team. When children are exclusively focused on outperforming their peers, they may miss key opportunities for personal development that come from learning to share ideas and listen to others.Conversely, teaching children to cooperate encourages valuable social skills such as empathy, communication, and conflict resolution. In our rapidly evolving society, the ability to work effectively in diverse teams is crucial. Cooperative learning environments allow children to understand different perspectives, nurturing their emotional intelligence and social awareness. These skills are vital not only in personal relationships but also in professional settings where teamwork drives success. Moreover, cooperation promotes a sense of community and belonging among children, which is essential for their emotional well-being. Teamwork experiences can foster friendships and create supportive environments where children feel valued and understood. In conclusion, while competition does have its place in promoting individual achievement, prioritizing cooperation lays a more solid foundation for developing socially responsible adults. By teaching children to work together harmoniously, we prepare them to thrive in a world that increasingly relies on collaboration and mutual support.
1;Nowadays, more people are migrating to other countries than ever before. In order to become integrated into society in their adopted countries, immigrants should abandon their old ways and adapt to local customs and codes of behaviour. Do you agree or disagree?;The last 50 years have seen an increasing number of immigrants to other countries. People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.Firstly, maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.Secondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.To conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one’s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society.;The phenomenon of increased migration in contemporary society has generated diverse perspectives on integration and cultural adaptation. While it is essential for immigrants to assimilate into their adopted countries, the notion that they must completely abandon their old ways is a contentious one. I argue that a balanced approach—where immigrants can maintain their cultural identity while adapting to local customs—is the most beneficial for both individuals and society at large.First and foremost, cultural exchange enriches societies. Immigrants bring unique traditions, perspectives, and experiences that can enhance the social fabric of their new homes. For instance, culinary diversity introduced by immigrants can lead to a more vibrant cultural scene. When immigrants retain aspects of their heritage, they contribute to a multicultural landscape that fosters understanding and acceptance among different groups, ultimately strengthening societal bonds.Moreover, the pressure to abandon one’s cultural identity can lead to feelings of alienation. Many immigrants face challenges such as homesickness and discrimination. Forcing them to shed their past can exacerbate these issues, leading to a lack of connection within their new community. By allowing immigrants to maintain their customs while adapting to local norms, society can create an inclusive environment in which all individuals feel valued.However, adapting to local customs is important for practical reasons such as effective communication and social cohesion. Learning the language, understanding societal norms, and respecting local traditions can facilitate smoother integration and enhance relationships with local citizens. This adaptation does not necessitate a loss of one’s own identity but rather an evolution of it, enabling mutual respect and understanding.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the necessity for immigrants to adapt to their new surroundings, I firmly believe that they should not be required to abandon their old ways entirely. A harmonious blend of cultural retention and adaptation fosters a richer, more inclusive society, ultimately benefiting everyone involved.
2;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last decade has seen an increasing number of tourists traveling to visit natural wonder sights, ancient heritages and different cultures around the world. While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations. Firstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country’s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists. Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores. These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard. Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country.Secondly, through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected. For instance, in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely ‘Trong Dong’ drum performance and ‘Ha Long’ bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry. Without this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works. Thus, tourism has survived many non-tangible cultural values and beauty scenes. To conclude, as far as I am concerned, international tourism has both triggered economic development and maintained cultural and environment values of the tourist countries. In addition, the authorities should adequately support these sustainable developments.;International tourism has undoubtedly become more prevalent in recent years, facilitated by advancements in technology, increased accessibility, and a globalized economy. This trend has sparked diverse opinions regarding its impacts on societies, cultures, and economies. While there are merits to international tourism, I believe that its positive aspects outweigh the negative, particularly in fostering cultural exchange and stimulating economic growth.One of the most significant benefits of international tourism is the cultural exchange it promotes. Tourists bring with them distinct customs, traditions, and perspectives, creating an opportunity for local communities to engage with different cultures. This not only enriches the lives of residents but also fosters greater understanding and tolerance among people from diverse backgrounds. For example, the influx of tourists can lead to art, music, and culinary exhibitions that introduce locals to foreign influences, ultimately enhancing the cultural landscape of tourist destinations. Moreover, international tourism serves as a crucial engine for economic development. Many countries rely heavily on tourism as a primary source of income, generating billions in revenue each year. This influx can create jobs across various sectors such as hospitality, transportation, and retail, contributing to local economies and reducing unemployment rates. Additionally, tourism encourages investment in infrastructure, such as roads, airports, and facilities, thereby benefiting both tourists and local residents.Conversely, opponents of international tourism often cite concerns regarding environmental degradation, overpopulation in tourist destinations, and the commodification of local cultures. These issues are valid and warrant attention. Nonetheless, with proper management and sustainable practices, the adverse effects of tourism can be mitigated. In conclusion, while concerns about international tourism's negative impacts should not be overlooked, its capacity to promote cultural exchange and bolster economies cannot be denied. By embracing international tourism responsibly, we can create a world that celebrates diversity and thrives economically.
3;International tourism is now more common than ever before. Some feel that this is a positive trend, while others do not. What are your opinions on this?;The last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide. While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations.Firstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations. Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits. This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism. Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.Secondly, there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals. As the Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat’s anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions. For this reason, many marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species. Thus, it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments.To conclude, I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments. If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future.;International tourism has experienced unprecedented growth in recent years, becoming more prevalent than ever before. This trend presents both positive and negative implications, sparking a robust debate about its impact on countries and local communities. In my opinion, the benefits of international tourism outweigh the drawbacks, creating opportunities for cultural exchange, economic growth, and global awareness.One of the most significant advantages of international tourism is the economic boost it provides to host countries. Tourism generates revenue, creates jobs, and stimulates local economies. Countries rich in cultural heritage and natural beauty, such as Thailand, Italy, and Costa Rica, rely heavily on tourism to support their economic structures. The influx of foreign currency can enhance public services, improve infrastructure, and contribute to social development. Communities that embrace international tourists often experience revitalization, as businesses flourish and local artisans gain wider recognition and patronage.Furthermore, international tourism fosters cultural exchange and understanding. When individuals travel to different countries, they immerse themselves in diverse customs, traditions, and lifestyles. This cross-cultural interaction enriches their experiences and broadens their perspectives. It awakens curiosity and appreciation for global diversity, contributing to greater tolerance and respect among nations. In a time when globalization is often met with skepticism, tourism serves as a bridge that connects people from varied backgrounds.However, it is essential to acknowledge the potential downsides of mass tourism, such as environmental degradation, cultural homogenization, and the strain on local communities. Popular destinations can become overcrowded, leading to the exploitation of natural resources and affecting the quality of life for residents. To mitigate these challenges, responsible tourism initiatives are crucial, emphasizing sustainability and respect for local cultures.In conclusion, while international tourism poses certain challenges, its overall impact is predominantly positive. By promoting economic development and fostering cultural understanding, international tourism plays a vital role in shaping our increasingly interconnected world. With sustainable practices and mindful travel, we can harness its benefits while addressing its drawbacks.
4;The idea of going overseas for university study is an exciting prospect for many people. But while it may offer some advantages, it is probably better to stay home because of the difficulties a student inevitably encounters living and studying in a different culture. To what extent do you agree or disagree this statement? Give reasons for your answer.;It is every student's desire to study at a good university and experience a new environment. While some students study and live overseas to achieve this, some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas. In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.First, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures. Compared to the peers studying in the home country, it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself/herself into new environments and situations in life.Second, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet. One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness, living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life. Moreover, the one will learn living without depending on anyone else.Also, employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills. Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market. Therefore, one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his/her peers.In conclusion, there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas. However, living and studying overseas gives the individual a new perspective on the subject that is studied or in general life.;The prospect of studying overseas undoubtedly excites many students, primarily due to the allure of experiencing new cultures, enhancing academic prospects, and gaining independence. However, while studying abroad presents several advantages, I argue that the challenges associated with adapting to a new culture and environment can outweigh these benefits, making it preferable for many students to remain closer to home.One major difficulty students face when studying abroad is cultural adjustment. Immersed in an unfamiliar environment, students often struggle with language barriers, differing social norms, and educational methods that differ from what they are accustomed to. These challenges can lead to feelings of isolation and homesickness. The stress of adapting can detract from the educational experience, hindering academic performance and personal development.Additionally, the financial implications of studying overseas are significant. Tuition fees for international students generally exceed those for domestic students, and added costs such as travel, accommodation, and living expenses can be overwhelming. For many families, these financial burdens create an obstacle that could compromise the quality of education a student receives, as financial stress can lead to less focus on studies and a diminished overall university experience.Furthermore, staying home offers students the advantage of familiarity and support systems. Being close to family and friends can provide emotional stability during the challenging transition into higher education. Local universities can also offer quality education and valuable networks that may lead to good job prospects without the added challenges of adjusting to a foreign culture.In conclusion, while the idea of studying abroad is enticing and presents unique opportunities for personal growth, the difficulties associated with cultural adjustment, financial strain, and emotional support suggest that staying home may be a more beneficial choice for many students. Ultimately, the decision should be weighed carefully, considering individual circumstances and aspirations.
5;Many students choose to attend schools or universities outside their home countries. Why do some students study abroad? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Studying abroad is one very common thing that students do, and they have different reasons for that. I believe that studying abroad has many advantages. Students gain a lot out of the experience personally, academically, and culturally.First of all, students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country. Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one's character. For example, students might face many challenges in the host country. Therefore, they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter. Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence. One other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies. For example, they will get exposed to a different educational system. They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country.Most important is the cultural aspect of the experience. While living in a foreign country, students can learn a lot about the culture of that country. Furthermore, they can meet different people of the country. They can learn about their way of thinking, their customs and traditions, and way of life. Learning about others' cultures is so important. It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world. It makes us more open, and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts. Also it educates us about the world we are living in. In conclusion, studying abroad does not only have advantages, but also can change us in a very positive way. It can influence us in different aspects of life.;Studying abroad has become a popular choice for many students in recent years. The decision to pursue education outside one’s home country is driven by multiple factors that offer unique personal, academic, and professional advantages.Firstly, one of the primary reasons students study abroad is the opportunity to experience different cultures. Immersing oneself in a new environment allows students to gain a broader perspective of the world. This cultural exchange not only enhances personal growth, fostering open-mindedness and adaptability, but it also helps students develop crucial life skills. For example, navigating daily life in a foreign country requires effective problem-solving and communication skills, which are indispensable in today’s interconnected world.Secondly, many students seek access to higher quality education and specialized programs that may not be available in their home countries. Institutions abroad often offer renowned academic programs, cutting-edge resources, and distinguished faculty. For instance, a student from a developing country may choose to pursue engineering or technology studies in a country known for its innovation in these fields, enhancing their academic credentials and future employability.Additionally, studying abroad provides valuable networking opportunities. Students can establish connections with peers, professors, and industry professionals from diverse backgrounds, which can lead to internships and job offers in the future. These international networks are vital in a globalized job market, where employers increasingly value cross-cultural competencies.Lastly, personal growth is a significant motivator for studying abroad. Living away from home challenges students to become more independent and self-reliant, often resulting in a more mature outlook on life. Confronting and overcoming the challenges of a new environment prepares students for future endeavors, both professionally and personally.In conclusion, students choose to study abroad for a myriad of reasons including cultural immersion, access to quality education, networking opportunities, and personal development. These experiences not only enrich their education but also provide them with skills and perspectives that shape their future endeavors, making the international educational experience immensely valuable.
6;With the rise in popularity of the internet, newspapers will soon become a thing of the past. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The internet has been more and more popular for recent years, providing people with a huge source of information. As a result of this, print media such as newspapers have experienced a dramatic decline in the number of readers. Some people, however, still believe that they can exist for long time; others disagree, arguing that newspapers have lost their competitive advantage to sustain their prolonged existence. Personally, I am inclined to agree with the latter view for following reasons.First of all, to obtain information, using the internet is quicker and more convenient than reading newspapers. Contrary to the past when people had to wait long hours to take a daily newspaper, nowadays, they can acquire latest news updated every second through their mobile phones or computers connected to the internet, everywhere and at anytime. As can be seen, these devices and machines are very common in all parts of the world, making it easier for people to read a number of things that newspapers can not provide in only some pages. Hence, the print media has failed to keep its important role in the provision of information.Another point is that, from the economic aspect, buying newspapers appears to be a waste of money when the internet becomes available for every one. It is clear to recognize that the internet service is being provided at a low cost or even free in many countries. The question arises as to whether or not a person spends an extra money buying newspapers to receive the same, even usually less information than those he can have with the internet? The answer, perhaps, is that hardly would rational people do so. For this reason, the number of people reading newspapers may continue falling sharply, possibly leading to the close-downs of many in the coming time.Last, but not least, when taking environment into consideration, people must conceive that the more newspapers are published, the more trees are cut down. This is simply the contributor to the deforestation which is happening all over the world today. At this point, newspapers' production will have to face environmentalists on its way to be alive.In conclusion, it might be unpleasant for some advocating newspapers to witness the extinction of the type of media. However, this, if occurring, should be seen as a result of the ever-increasing innovations in media technology and in our modern life as a whole.";The advent of the internet has undeniably transformed the landscape of information consumption, leading many to predict the decline of traditional newspapers. While it is apparent that digital platforms have gained tremendous popularity, asserting that newspapers will become obsolete overlooks several critical factors.Firstly, the immediacy and accessibility of the internet have revolutionized how we receive news. Websites, blogs, and social media provide real-time updates and instant access to information from around the globe. This speed is appealing, particularly to younger audiences who are accustomed to obtaining news and information at their fingertips. Furthermore, online news outlets often offer interactive features, such as videos, comment sections, and shareable content, enhancing reader engagement in ways that print cannot.However, it is essential to acknowledge the enduring qualities of newspapers that continue to hold significant value. For many, newspapers offer a sense of credibility and reliability that can sometimes be lacking in the vast sea of information available online. Investigative journalism, in-depth analysis, and well-researched reporting are still predominantly found in traditional print media, which is often subject to strict editorial standards. This journalistic integrity attracts readers who seek trustworthy information and nuanced perspectives.Moreover, newspapers serve a vital role in local communities. Local journalism, often delivered through print media, provides essential coverage of regional issues that resonate with residents. With internet algorithms favoring broader topics and sensational news, local newspapers remain indispensable in fostering community engagement and accountability.In conclusion, while the internet has significantly altered how news is disseminated and consumed, it is overly simplistic to declare newspapers a relic of the past. Their unique contributions to credible journalism and community-focused reporting continue to resonate with readers, ensuring that while the medium may evolve, the essence of news is likely to endure.
7;For successful development of a country, should a government focus its budget more on very young children education rather than universities?;"""Education is the investment in our future"", as Senator Bernie Sanders once pointed out, education, which fosters a civilized society, plays a significant role in a country's long-lasting prosperity. It is no wonder that governments throughout the world lay special emphasis on education development. As for the two integral components within the system, elementary and advanced education, there's no doubt that a government is supposed to offer sufficient financial support for both.Concerning that elementary education, like the base of a architecture, is the fundamental requirement to be a qualified citizen in today's society, government should guarantee that all people have equal and convenient access to it. So a lack of well-established primary education goes hand in hand with a high rate of illiteracy, and this interplay seriously compromises a country's future development. In other words, if countries, especially the developing countries, are determined to take off, one of the key points governments should set on agenda is to educate more qualified future citizens through elementary education.That's not enough, for higher education, which represent the cutting edge of a country's academic achievements, act as the vanguard in economic and social advance. The high technology and new ideas applied into practice may not only lead a country to flourish but also elevate its status in the international community. Some may argue that universities can support themselve well by donation or invention, but this argument is invalid. Researches into humanities and art still need large amount of money, what's more, government's big budget on universities may attract more excellent intellectuals and researchers into the country and enjoy a higher reputation worldwide.From reasons listed above, we can safely draw the conclusion that, a government should spare effort on young children education as well as universities, both are crucial on the way to a brighter future.";The question of whether a government should allocate its budget primarily to early childhood education as opposed to universities is one that has significant implications for the long-term development of a country. Investing in the education of young children can yield considerable benefits that not only impact individuals but also foster overall societal progress.First and foremost, the early years of a child's life are critical for cognitive, emotional, and social development. Studies have consistently shown that quality early childhood education can lead to improved outcomes as children grow older. These foundational years shape a child’s future learning capabilities and social skills, making investment in early education vital. By focusing on young children, governments can improve literacy and numeracy rates, reduce dropout rates in later education, and enhance the overall quality of the workforce in the future.Furthermore, early education is often more cost-effective than investments in higher education. By addressing educational disparities at a young age, governments can mitigate the need for extensive remedial programs later on. Preventive measures, such as quality preschool programs, reduce the need for expensive interventions down the line and can result in significant savings for the public sector.However, it is important not to undermine the value of higher education. Universities play a crucial role in developing advanced skills and knowledge necessary for innovation and leadership in various sectors. Therefore, while the emphasis on early education is vital, a balanced approach would be more effective. Governments should commit a portion of budgets to both early childhood initiatives and higher education institutions to ensure a well-rounded educational ecosystem that prepares citizens for all stages of life.In conclusion, while prioritizing early childhood education may provide substantial long-term benefits for a country’s development, it is crucial that such efforts are complemented by adequate funding for universities. A dual-focus strategy will better equip future generations to contribute to the nation's prosperity and sustainability.
8;Many students have to live with roommates while going to school or university. What are some of the important qualities of a good roommate? Use specific reasons and examples to explain why these qualities are important.;"Much has been said about the importance about good roommates and how roommates will affect our life in school. Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considered. In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. Consideration is always important in relationship. For example, roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time. Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine. At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously. Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life. It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member.Moreover, communication is as well making a good roommate. People have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning. One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project. If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk. Therefore, communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation. Through communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others.In conclusion, there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important. Consideration and communication, in my personal opinion, are the most important quality. However, people might not get what they want all the time. The sky is the limit; there are all kinds of personality out there. We need to be flexible to be account into society.";"Living with roommates is a significant aspect of the student experience in school and university settings. The quality of a roommate can greatly influence not only one's academic performance but also mental well-being. Therefore, it is essential to recognize the important qualities that contribute to a successful roommate relationship. Three of these qualities are respectfulness, good communication, and shared responsibilities.First and foremost, respectfulness is crucial in a roommate. Each individual comes from different backgrounds and has unique lifestyles and study habits. A respectful roommate will acknowledge these differences, ensuring that they are considerate of the other person's space, belongings, and routines. For example, if one roommate prefers a quiet environment for studying while the other enjoys listening to music, respect means finding a compromise, such as using headphones or setting specific ""quiet hours."" This mutual respect fosters a positive living situation and minimizes conflicts.Good communication is another essential quality. Open channels of communication prevent misunderstandings and promote harmony. For instance, if one roommate is feeling overwhelmed with schoolwork or personal issues, a good roommate will create a safe space to discuss these feelings. Regular check-ins can address potential problems before they escalate, ensuring both roommates feel heard and valued. This open dialogue builds trust and strengthens the relationship.Lastly, shared responsibilities play a vital role in cohabitation. When roommates split chores, such as cleaning, grocery shopping, and paying bills, it promotes a sense of teamwork and fairness. For example, if one roommate consistently takes out the trash while the other does the dishes, it ensures that both individuals contribute equally to maintaining a pleasant and functional living environment. Failure to share responsibilities often leads to resentment and conflict, which can disrupt both personal life and academic focus.In conclusion, respectfulness, good communication, and shared responsibilities are essential qualities of a good roommate. These traits help create a supportive environment that enhances the overall college experience, allowing students to thrive both academically and personally."
9;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways) . Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay;Nowadays transportation has attracted much social concern. Whether governments should invest more money in traffic infrastructure or focus more on developing public transportation has erupted endless controversy. It does not seem unreasonable to suggest that governments spend more money on buses, trains, and subways investment. Such public vehicles are used to serve a large number of people in society therefore they help alleviate traffic congestion and decrease the amount of carbon released into the air. Both these two things are important.First and foremost, carbon emission cut is significantly essential for protecting the atmosphere. The fact is that the more cars and motorbikes are on roads, the more seriously the ozone layer is damaged. If governments use more money to improve roads, there is a strong likelihood that more people drive their private cars work. This is sure to lead to more carbon emitted into the atmosphere, which can cause skin cancer and destroy the natural environment. Whereas, if there are more good buses, trains, or subways, people are inclined to use less private vehicles, which decreases the amount of carbon released. Obviously, the policy that concentrates money on developing public transportation brings an advantageous impact on earth. In addition, the policy would play a pivotal part in relieving traffic jam. It is quiet clear that traffic congestion is a serious problem in many big cities. The main reason for this issue is that there are a great number of vehicles flowing on roads. In order to tackle the problem, governments have to turn people' attention on public vehicles to reduce cars and motorbikes. There is the possibility that improving roads and highways does not seem to reach the major cause of traffic congestion.In conclusion, I would concede that high-quality roads and highways make it easier to move around. Nevertheless, public transportation systems even have more important advantages. They not only ease traffic jam but also protect the atmosphere. That is why many governments around the world invest more money on developing public transportation facilities.;The debate over whether governments should allocate more funds to improving roads and highways or to enhancing public transportation is a pressing issue in many urban areas around the world. While both infrastructures are essential for the functioning of a society, I believe that governments should prioritize investments in public transportation. One compelling reason to prioritize public transportation is its ability to mitigate traffic congestion. As cities become increasingly populated, the number of vehicles on the road skyrockets, leading to significant traffic jams. By improving public transit systems such as buses, trains, and subways, governments can provide viable alternatives to driving, which can ease overall traffic and reduce travel times for everyone. A robust public transportation network encourages people to use shared rides instead of individual cars, ultimately decreasing the number of vehicles on the road.Additionally, investing in public transportation has environmental benefits. Roads and highways contribute to pollution due to emissions from countless vehicles. By fostering the use of public transit, governments can promote sustainable travel options that lower individual carbon footprints. Effective public transportation systems can significantly cut greenhouse gas emissions, thereby addressing climate change and improving air quality in urban areas. Moreover, enhancing public transit can provide greater social equity. Many individuals, especially those from lower-income demographics, rely on public transportation to access jobs, education, and essential services. Well-maintained and efficient transit systems can empower these communities by connecting them to opportunities, thus contributing to economic mobility and reducing social disparities.In conclusion, while both road infrastructure and public transportation require attention, the emphasis should be placed on improving public transit. The benefits of reduced traffic congestion, environmental sustainability, and social equality underscore the necessity for governments to invest in promising public transportation systems for the betterment of society as a whole.
10;Some people say that physical exercise should be a required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.Ê;"Although some people think that the major part of school schedule should be entirely devoted to academics, I truly believe that the physical education part should not be outweighed. Physical exercises help to create healthy nation, assist to learning through direct observation and finally aid to financial development of a country. First of all, the ancient Latin proverb says: ""Anima sana in corpore sano"", which means that healthy body is basis for healthy soul. There is a direct linkage between people's health and the frequency of doing physical exercises. The more we practice, the better we feel. Additionally, there is a fact that one can improve health conditions with everyday physical activity: gradually, step by step we change physical condition to better. So, if the entire nation, from their school ages begin going for sports and try doing that everyday, eventually it may help to build healthy nation.Besides, when we practice outdoors and indoors sports, many aspects are getting clearer. For example, when a person goes jogging everyday, eventually he can understand his own body through direct observation. Alike, the school basketball team gains more knowledge on how to succeed in some particular kind of throwing the ball into hoot practicing rather than learning theoretically. Furthermore, almost all natural science discoveries were made by direct observation, which is a part of physical education. Last, but not least, financial sustainability of a region mostly depends on how healthy the population is. For instance, the money invested into physical education program can save allocations into healthcare, since the nation is comparatively healthy. Along with that, physically healthy people can contribute more both into economical and social development. As a matter of fact, the better a person feels, the better his brain works. Therefore, putting physical activities in early steps of human development would finally lead to mentally healthy society. As hence it ends up with financially competitive country.In the conclusion, I would like to say that the more attention is withdrawn to a problem of physical education, the more influence we can get on academic success of students.";The debate over whether physical exercise should be a required component of the school day or if students should concentrate solely on academic studies is pivotal in shaping a well-rounded education. I firmly believe that physical exercise should be mandatory in schools due to its substantial benefits for students’ physical health, mental well-being, and overall academic performance.Firstly, physical exercise is crucial for students’ physical health. In an age where sedentary lifestyles are increasingly prevalent, incorporating regular physical activity in schools can combat obesity and associated health issues. By engaging in structured activities such as sports, yoga, or even simple exercises, students develop habits that promote long-term health. This foundational fitness encourages them to lead active lives, reducing the risk of chronic illnesses in adulthood.Furthermore, exercise plays a significant role in enhancing students' mental well-being. Numerous studies have shown a clear link between physical activity and improved mood, decreased anxiety, and greater cognitive functioning. When students exercise, their brains release endorphins, which can alleviate stress and improve concentration. This increased mental clarity can lead to better academic performance, as students are more focused and engaged in their studies. Therefore, a balanced approach that includes exercise can complement academic learning effectively.Additionally, physical exercise teaches valuable life skills that traditional academic subjects may not address. Team sports and group activities instill lessons in teamwork, discipline, and resilience. These attributes are essential as they prepare students not only for the challenges of higher education but also for the competitive workforce.In conclusion, incorporating physical exercise into the school curriculum is critical. It fosters physical health, enhances mental well-being, and equips students with essential life skills. A holistic education should prioritize both academics and physical activity, preparing students for lifelong success in all aspects of their lives.
11;Advance in transportation and communication like the airplane and the telephone have changed the way that nations interact with each other in a global society. Choose another technological innovation that you think is important. Give specific reason for your choice.;Nowadays, everyone can see the effect of technology on their life, especially on the way of transportations and communications such as the airplane and the telephone. There are lots of other effects of growing technology on transportations and communications, which are mentioned as follows. First and foremost, email can be count as one of the most beneficial results of modern technology. Many years ago, peoples had to pay a great deal of money to post their letters, and their payements were related to the weight of their letters or boxes, and many accidents may cause problem that the post could not be delivered. But nowadays, all people can take advantage of internet to have their own email free, and send their emails to everyone in no time, besides they can be sure if their emails have been delivered or not.Another important aspect on technology is transferring money. Today, students can apply for foreign universities much easier than before. Not only with the help of sending email, but also using credit cards to pay all necessary fees online. Therefore, with the advent of internet and online paying systems, you can do many thing at your home easily.Another technological innovations which help people around the world is related to medical equipments. Biomedical engineers could make a significant effect on increasing life expectancy the world. For example, one of their inventions was related to artificial heart valves which can be count as a turning point in heart surgeries. In the past time doctors used pig heart's valve to implant, but the patient could not be alive more than 3 years after the replacement. But now, biomedical engineers can make artificial heart valves which works well and doctors can implant them easily. To sum up, technology has helped us to have more comfortable life. You can see its effects on transportation, communication, medicine and so forth.;"In the tapestry of the modern world, advances in transportation and communication have undeniably reshaped the dynamics of international interaction. Among the various technological innovations, the Internet stands out as a particularly transformative force. Its impact on global society is profound, altering how nations communicate, conduct trade, and engage in diplomacy.The Internet has bridged geographical divides, enabling instant communication regardless of location. This immediacy facilitates real-time dialogue, which is crucial in today's fast-paced world. Nations are no longer isolated entities; they can engage in discussions and negotiations without the constraints of time zones or physical barriers. For example, virtual summits and international conferences are now commonplace, allowing world leaders to collaborate on pressing global issues like climate change or public health crises swiftly.Moreover, the Internet has revolutionized global commerce. E-commerce platforms have opened up markets, allowing small businesses in developing nations to connect with customers worldwide. This democratization of trade fosters economic growth and creates opportunities that were previously unavailable, integrating nations into a more interconnected global economy. As a result, collaboration and competition coexist in a fluid marketplace, driving innovation and improving consumer choices.Additionally, social media platforms have redefined diplomacy. Public opinion plays a more significant role than ever, with leaders using platforms like Twitter and Facebook to communicate directly with citizens and worldwide audiences. This transparency can enhance or undermine diplomatic efforts depending on the context and public sentiment, demonstrating the Internet's dual-edged influence.In conclusion, the Internet serves as a cornerstone of modern interaction among nations, influencing communication, commerce, and diplomacy. Its ability to foster connections and enable rapid information exchange underscores its importance in shaping a global society where collaboration is both necessary and inevitable. As technological advancements continue to unfold, the Internet will likely remain integral to international relations, reflecting the evolving nature of global interdependence."
12;Agree or disagree:Technology has made children less creative than they were in the past.;Technology accelerates human's evolving pace. With advanced technology, many things that seemed impossible in the past, have become realities. For example, people in the past never dreamed of talking to anyone whenever they wanted or see someone overseas on a computer screen, both of these can be achieved with cellphone and internet. However, some people point that technology has made children less creative. I don't deny that technology may have some negative effects on children, but I think technology makes children even more creative.First, technology inspires children to create new things. Children are curious about everything around them, so when they come across a high-tech product like a cellphone, they will be obsessed with its mysterious functions and eager to know how it works. For example, Bill Gates was attracted by the original huge computer, then he did everything he could to understand how it worked. After he had figured out all the stuff, he then began to promote the computer. In the end, he successfully invented a computer that was easy to use and lightweight. Therefore, instead of interfering children's creativity, technology actually encourages children to learn and to create.Second, technology widen children's knowledge. In the past, children were only able to see things from one perspective. However, with highly advanced technology, children are able to get information from foreign countries and even communicate with foreign friends. Therefore, they will be able to learn about different cultures and different ways of thinking. Knowledge is the base of creativity. The diverse knowledge that children gained from different parts of the world, inspires children and encourage them to create new things.Admittedly, technology may have negative effects on children. Technology has made life too easy for most children. In comfortable conditions, children may be satisfied with the world around them and refuse to make a change. Nonetheless, with the development of technology, increasingly more young people become obsessed with high-tech products. They kept researching new technology and became successful at a very young age.;"In the contemporary debate surrounding technology's impact on childhood creativity, there are valid arguments on both sides. However, I contend that technology has not inherently made children less creative; rather, it has transformed the way they express their creativity.To begin with, technology provides children with a plethora of tools and resources that were unimaginable in the past. Digital platforms such as social media, video editing software, and digital art applications offer new mediums for creative expression. For instance, children can now blend music, art, and storytelling in ways that are easily shareable with a global audience. This exposure invites them to think outside the traditional boundaries of creativity, leading to innovative forms of self-expression that simply did not exist before. Young creators can engage with diverse cultures and ideas, fostering an environment where creativity thrives.Moreover, many educational applications and online platforms promote creative thinking and problem-solving. Games and interactive software that encourage exploration and experimentation can stimulate children's imagination. Programs that require coding, for example, not only teach logical thinking but also provide a canvas for children to create their own games, animations, or applications. This blend of creativity and technology inspires a new generation of inventors and thinkers.On the contrary, it is essential to acknowledge that excessive reliance on technology can lead to passive consumption rather than active participation in creative endeavors. Screen time can divert attention from hands-on activities that cultivate imagination, such as drawing, building, or playing outside. Therefore, the challenge lies in finding a balance in the integration of technology into childhood experiences.In conclusion, rather than diminishing creativity, technology has redefined and expanded it. By embracing these tools judiciously, parents and educators can harness the potential of technology to foster creativity in children, preparing them to navigate an increasingly digital world."
13;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Over the last half century the change in the life of human beings has increased beyond our wildest expectations. There are countless new technological equipments flooding into our lives, such as the Internet, television and cell phone. They all enrich our daily lives. Now, many students learn from Internet after class and they find it quite helpful.Many people find that students at schools and universities still learn much more from lessons with teachers. They argue that teachers teach students how to write, read and calculate since they are in kindergarten. And when they are in primary school, teachers teach them more further knowledge, like writing skills and using computers. It is teachers that help them with obstacles in schooling. On the other hand, students gain most of the knowledge through teachers and learn what is right and wrong with the assistance of teachers.Those who feel that students learn far more from other sources, such as the Internet and television, firmly believe that within this sources students learn lots of things which they can't learn in classes. They can only input some key words and google it, and then there are numberless articles and websites related to it. In this case, students learn things easily. Moreover, they contend that good television programs do teach students. For instance, Discovery Channel has many instructive episodes. Students have knowledge of others cultures, outer space etc.Personally, I think that students learn far more from their teachers than from other source. Because not only do teachers teach us knowledge but also the skills to tell right from wrong. Just imagine: if a student can't even make out whether the source is reasonable or not, then how can he get the right information to help him to learn?;In the contemporary educational landscape, the role of teachers as facilitators of knowledge is foregrounded by the increasing availability of alternative learning sources such as the internet and television. However, I contend that while these resources provide valuable supplementary information, the lessons delivered by teachers offer unique advantages that are indispensable for a comprehensive learning experience.Firstly, teachers bring a wealth of personal experience and expertise that cannot be replicated by static resources. The nuanced explanations, real-world examples, and interactive discussions fostered in a classroom setting enable students to grasp complex concepts more effectively. Teachers can tailor their teaching styles to accommodate different learning preferences, whereas online sources often present information in a one-size-fits-all manner that may not resonate with every student.Furthermore, the environment created by a teacher promotes critical thinking and engagement in ways that passive consumption of information cannot. Class discussions, collaborative projects, and hands-on activities encourage students to explore ideas, ask questions, and challenge assumptions. This dynamic interaction not only deepens understanding but also nurtures essential skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. While videos and articles can be informative, they generally lack the interactive aspect that encourages deeper intellectual engagement.Additionally, teachers serve as mentors and role models for students. They provide emotional support and guidance that can significantly impact a student’s motivation and confidence. The mentor-student relationship fosters an environment of trust where students feel comfortable expressing their thoughts and concerns, something that is difficult to achieve through impersonal online learning.In conclusion, while alternative sources of information like the internet and television offer important insights and supplemental knowledge, the comprehensive educational experience cultivated by teachers remains irreplaceable. The blend of expertise, interactive learning, and mentorship they provide equips students with the tools they need not only to succeed academically but also to navigate life's challenges beyond the classroom. Thus, I strongly believe that learning from teachers holds a paramount place in education.
14;Email and text messaging have transformed communication but they are seriously threatening the status of written language. How far do you agree or disagree with this statement?;The introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.First of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.The popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts. Moreover, it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments. If that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand.In conclusion, we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity. Nevertheless, educators and individuals themselves, especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one.;"The advent of email and text messaging has undeniably transformed communication, creating new avenues for connection and interaction that were unheard of just a few decades ago. However, this revolution has also led to concerns regarding the degradation of written language. While it is true that these forms of communication can pose challenges to traditional linguistic norms, the argument that they seriously threaten the status of written language merits a more nuanced examination.On one hand, the brevity and informality characterizing text messaging and emails have given rise to a plethora of abbreviations, acronyms, and emoticons. This shift has fundamentally altered how people use language, often promoting a more casual style that may undermine grammatical conventions and spelling precision. For instance, the ease of texting has led many to develop a reliance on shorthand expressions, which may erode literacy skills among younger generations who are still mastering traditional writing.Conversely, it can be argued that these modern communication methods serve as a creative outlet for language evolution rather than a threat. The rich array of forms emerging from texting and emailing, such as memes, GIFs, and visual storytelling, reflects a dynamic linguistic landscape. Furthermore, the instant nature of these communications encourages immediacy and spontaneity, allowing for real-time engagement that traditional written language often lacks.In many respects, the relationship between technology and language is symbiotic; email and text may have changed the context in which written communication occurs, but they have also revitalized interest in language through their innovative formats. Importantly, many people still engage in formal and high-standard writing when necessary, indicating that written language has not been wholly compromised.In conclusion, while the rise of email and text messaging has brought challenges to traditional writing standards, it has also introduced opportunities for language evolution and diversity. Thus, rather than viewing these technologies as a significant threat, we should recognize their capacity to enrich and adapt the way we communicate."
15;Some people think it is acceptable to use animals for the benefit of the human beings. Some people think it is wrong to exploit animals for the human purposes. What is your opinion?;"With the rapid development of the standard of people's life, increasing numbers of animal experiments are done, new medicines and foods, for instance. Some opponents says that it is cruel to animals and nature, however, I believe that no sensible person will deny that it is a dramatically cruel activity to humanity if the latest foods or medicines are allowed to sold without testing on animals. In my essay, I will discuss this issue from twofold aspects.First of all, as we all know, animals are friendly and vital for people, because if there are no animals in the world, the balance of nature will broke down, and we, human, will die out as well. The animal experiments accelerate the vanishing of some categories of animals. In other words, doing this various testing is a hazard of human's future and next generation.Though animal experiments have negative impact on the natural balance, it is necessary to make sure that people can live a long life. To begin with, it is indisputable that every new kind food or pill may be noxious, and scientists must do something to insure that the new invention benefits people instead of making people ill or even dying. The new foods or medicines are invented to promote the quantity of human's life. Thus even if they are volunteers; they cannot take the place of animals to test the new foods or medicines. Furthermore, it also have potentially harm for human's health without any testing. To sum up, I reaffirm that although there is some disadvantages of animals' profits, the merits of animal experiments still outweigh the demerits.";The ethical debate surrounding the use of animals for human benefit has been a contentious issue, with passionate arguments on both sides. On one hand, some individuals believe that the utilization of animals is justified if it serves humanity's needs, particularly in the realms of research, agriculture, and entertainment. Proponents assert that animal testing has contributed significantly to medical advancements, saving countless human lives. They contend that the domestication of animals for food and labor has been integral to human survival and development throughout history. This perspective hinges on the idea that humans possess a higher moral status, which allows for the exploitation of animals when it results in significant benefits for society.Conversely, there are strong arguments against the exploitation of animals, emphasizing moral and ethical considerations. Opponents of animal use argue that such practices infringe upon the rights of sentient beings, who are capable of feeling pain and suffering. They advocate for a more compassionate approach, positing that animals have intrinsic value and deserve respect and protection, regardless of their utility to humans. Numerous campaigns and movements promote vegetarianism and veganism, reflecting a growing societal shift towards recognizing the rights of animals.In my opinion, while some use of animals may be necessary and beneficial, it is imperative that it be conducted ethically and with strict regulations. The potential for scientific and medical advancements should not come at the cost of animal welfare. In an age where alternatives such as synthetic testing and plant-based products are becoming increasingly viable, we must seek to minimize animal exploitation and prioritize humane treatment. Thus, rather than outright exploitation, a balanced approach that maximizes benefits while minimizing harm is essential for a just society.
16;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinions.;It is very hard to find a home that does not have a television. Nowadays, number of television channels and programs are increasing everyday. Unfortunately, most of people do not have a plan for make a limitation or schedule for watching television. I agree with that idea that television devastate families ties.In spite of enjoying watching television shows, it is really time consuming task. Emergence of new television channels or shows are not surprising. We kill time by tracking these channels so at the end of the day we understand it is late for doing any other activities. This is a problem that suffers all of us everyday. At the end, there is no time for call to our parents or friends.Second, I think watching television programs makes us lazy. We usually spend our times in front of television for at least three ours a day when we come back home after eight-hour working in the office. Hence, we do not have time to spend for healthy activity such as going to a gym or doing other sports. This makes us a lazy person who prefers to do sedentary activities like watching television shows rather than be active and sociable.Last but not least, some television programs have a negative effect on viewers. Some thriller or action movies advertise negative activities such as doing criminal activity. These genre of programs has more negative effects on our teenagers. They usually try to mimic what they see on movies in their daily behaviors.To sum up, killing our time, making us lazy, and advertising negative behaviors are just only few reasons to show how television is destructive. I think it is a global problem to solve this problem and it is need global contribution to find a solution.;Television has long been a staple in many households, often touted as a source of entertainment, news, and even education. However, the assertion that television has destroyed communication among friends and family merits closer examination. While it is true that excessive television consumption can lead to reduced interpersonal interactions, I disagree with the notion that it has fundamentally ruined communication. Firstly, television can serve as a medium for fostering conversations and connections. For instance, shared viewing experiences of popular shows can provide common ground for friends and family members. Discussing plot twists, character relationships, or themes can lead to deeper conversations that enhance understanding and bonding. Such discussions can encourage family members to share personal thoughts, feelings, and viewpoints, cultivating a richer communicative environment.Moreover, television has evolved into a platform that can raise awareness about important social issues. Programs and documentaries often ignite discussions around topics like climate change, mental health, and social justice. These conversations can lead to informed dialogue among friends and family, promoting empathy and a sense of collective responsibility. Far from destroying communication, television can act as a catalyst for meaningful discussions.On the other hand, it is crucial to acknowledge that excessive television watching, especially when it leads to individual isolation, can hinder communication. However, this is a matter of balance and moderation rather than an inherent flaw of television itself. Families and friends have the power to set boundaries regarding screen time, ensuring that television does not encroach on quality time spent together.In conclusion, while television has the potential to distract and detract from communication, it can also enhance connections and stimulate meaningful discussions. Rather than viewing it as a destroyer of communication, it would be more apt to see it as a tool that, when used judiciously, enriches relationships among friends and family.
17;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays men and women are equally participating in every field. Contrastingly, in the past time, women worked at home and performed sophisticated work. This factor is still affecting thinking of many people. They still believe that in present time women must do such type of work only. This tendency enforces universities to accept student according to the gender.Universities should accept equal numbers of students of both genders. Initially, if we look into the fact, women have proved themselves in every field whether it is indoor or outdoor. For example, nowadays women are working in home as well as in the sky. They are acting as a good housewife and they are flying planes also. Furthermore, university authority must not be biased on ground of the gender discrimination. They must consider the academic record of the student as main criteria of admission. However, the current job market affects the decision of universities. Every university designs its courses according to the need of employers. The job selection criteria are pre decided. For instance employers need male candidates for the heavy work such as repairing and installation of heavy machine. They prefer male staff for night shifts. They want female candidates for soft natured work like counseling, teaching, designing etc. Therefore, universities follow the requirement of job providers and decide subject suitable for particular gender.To conclude, I strongly believe that universities must open choice for everyone to select his subject. Our youth has become very confident towards his career. They are not ready to be bound in certain limitations. Female candidates also do not care about any restriction posed by the society and the employer. So we must give them opportunity to achieve their goal.;The discourse surrounding gender representation in universities has evolved significantly over recent years, with an increasing call for institutions to adopt policies that ensure gender equity in student admissions. However, the proposition that universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject merits careful examination. While striving for gender parity in education is essential, implementing a rigid quota could undermine the fundamental values of academic merit and individual choice.On one hand, promoting equal representation can help challenge and dismantle traditional gender stereotypes within fields where one gender predominates. For instance, engineering and technology have historically been male-dominated, while nursing and education often attract more females. By striving for balanced admissions, universities can foster a more inclusive environment, encouraging diverse perspectives and fostering innovation across all disciplines. This also aligns with societal goals of achieving gender equity, allowing women to thrive in areas where they have been underrepresented.Conversely, enforcing strict numerical parity may inadvertently lead to the compromise of meritocracy. Students should ideally be admitted based on their qualifications, skills, and passion for the subject rather than solely their gender. Adopting equal admissions numbers could harm students who may have more potential and motivation, thus detracting from the quality of education. Furthermore, imposing quotas could overlook the complexity of individual choices and the diverse aspirations of students, leading to a potentially adversarial and counterproductive academic environment.In conclusion, while the pursuit of gender equity in university admissions is laudable, enforcing equal numbers of male and female students in every subject may not be the most effective approach. Emphasizing a commitment to gender equity through supportive programs, scholarships, and outreach initiatives may better serve the interests of both individuals and society, enhancing inclusivity without compromising academic integrity.
18;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better?;Many young adults want to get away from their parent's houses as soon as possible in order to have no limits, to be independent. But these young people do not take into account that their lives are going to be more difficult, when they are away from home. They will have to pay a lot of bills, because they will have to find a lodging or at least a place where to live and in order to have less expenses they will have to find a co-tenant, who they may not like. Living in their own houses will save the young adults a lot of money. If they live separate from their parents they will have to pay for a loan, electricity, water or even for a meal. If the young adults still study they will have to combine studying with working, because they will not have money to pay for everything. There will not be such worries when young adults live in their own home, because parents will take care for them. Moreover, parents will give their children money in order they to focus only on studying.Another problem that the young adults may encounter is to find a co-tenant, who they do not like. His habits may be totally different from theirs, his behavior may be inappropriate, but they will have to live with him or even share a room, in order to have less expenses. Living with such a person may be a huge problem for the young adults. When the co-tenant do not share their interests and points of view, they will not be able to ask him for advice. Furthermore, they are most likely to quarrel every day, instead of to help each other.In conclusion, I reckon that for the young adults it will be better to live with their parents, because of the benefits they will have. They will not need to worry about financial problems or if they will get on well with their roommate.;The transition from adolescence to adulthood is a pivotal period in a young person's life, marked by choices that shape their future. Among these choices is the decision to seek independence from parental figures or to remain living with them for an extended period. While both situations have their merits, I believe that pursuing independence as soon as feasible is ultimately the better option for young adults.Firstly, seeking independence fosters personal growth and self-discovery. When young adults move out and manage their own lives, they are compelled to develop crucial life skills, such as financial management, decision-making, and problem-solving. These experiences build resilience and confidence, equipping them for the complexities of adulthood. Living independently forces individuals to adapt to new challenges, which can lead to a stronger sense of identity and greater emotional maturity.In addition, independence encourages responsibility. When young adults are accountable for their own living arrangements, they learn to prioritize their obligations, from paying bills to maintaining a household. This sense of responsibility can instill a work ethic and discipline that are invaluable in both personal and professional realms. Furthermore, independence often leads to more meaningful and reciprocal relationships with parents, as the adult child moves beyond the confines of dependence and fosters a partnership based on mutual respect and support.Conversely, living with parents can contribute to a prolonged sense of immaturity, where young adults may rely excessively on their families for financial and emotional support. This can create an environment where life skills are not fully developed, potentially hindering their transition to adulthood.In conclusion, while living with family for an extended period may provide comfort and security, the benefits of seeking independence early on—personal growth, responsibility, and maturity—far outweigh the comforts of cohabitation. Therefore, young adults should strive to embrace independence as a critical step towards achieving their full potential.
19;Some people believe that the government is responsible for cleaning up the environment while other people belief it should be the responsibility of companies and private individuals. Whats you opinion? ;Air pollution is an issue threatening the environment in many different ways such as causing holes in the ozone and affecting global heating in the negative way. I believe that more responsibilities should put on private individuals and companies such as paying to clean up air pollution. First, in most industrialized countries, there is a number of companies that holds heavy factories in their constitutions. The waste products and harmful gases produced by these factories cause a significant amount of air pollution. While these companies make a huge amount of money from their businesses, most of them are not considering to take precautions to reduce the amount of air pollution. If these companies were obliged to pay to clean up the air pollution, they would at least make an effort to reduce the amount of air pollution they cause.Second, private individuals cause air pollution in several ways such as inessential use of cars and house heating. As house heating is a major need in the winter time, some households do not consider to use filters to reduce the amount of pollution that the heating causes. Instead of this, some expensive vehicles cause a huge amount of pollution. In my opinion, by charging private individuals for causing air pollution, that will at least contribute to reduce the amount of the pollution. On the other hand, I believe that governments should restrict the use of products that cause air pollution for both individuals and companies. Governments also should use an amount of money from their budgets to clean up the air, instead of putting all the responsibility to companies and private individuals. In conclusion, due to the fact that governments are responsible to provide a healthy environment for their inhabitants and they should be responsible from cleaning up the air pollution, both companies and private individuals should take the main part to clean up the air pollution.;The debate over who should bear the responsibility for cleaning up the environment has gained momentum as the effects of climate change and pollution become increasingly evident. On one hand, some believe that it is the government's role to spearhead environmental restoration efforts, while others argue that companies and individuals should shoulder this responsibility. I contend that while the government plays a crucial role, a collective responsibility involving individuals and corporations is necessary for effective environmental stewardship.Firstly, governments possess the regulatory framework, resources, and authority to implement large-scale environmental cleanup initiatives. They can allocate public funds for projects aimed at restoring ecosystems, reducing emissions, and promoting sustainable practices. Furthermore, governments can enforce environmental laws and regulations that compel corporations to minimize their ecological footprints. For instance, policies like carbon taxes and stringent waste management regulations serve to incentivize businesses to adopt environmentally friendly practices.However, relying solely on governments is insufficient. Companies, particularly those in resource-intensive industries, have a significant impact on environmental degradation. Therefore, they must take responsibility for their operations and find innovative ways to lessen their ecological impact. Socially responsible practices, such as adopting cleaner technologies, reducing waste, and ensuring sustainable supply chains, can create a ripple effect that fosters a culture of environmental stewardship.Moreover, individuals play a pivotal role in environmental preservation. Grassroots movements and community engagement can drive significant change. When individuals adopt sustainable habits, such as recycling, conserving water, and using public transportation, they contribute to a broad-based effort to address environmental issues. Additionally, public awareness campaigns can galvanize collective action and inspire others to prioritize ecological sustainability.In conclusion, while the government holds a primary responsibility in enforcing regulations and funding environmental initiatives, the role of companies and individuals is equally important. A collaborative approach, combining the efforts of all stakeholders, is essential for effective environmental cleanup and the promotion of a sustainable future. Only through shared responsibility can we hope to tackle the pressing environmental challenges of our time.
20;High sales of a product are mainly due to good advertisment strategies. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;Everyday, companies offer a huge number of different products to consumers. The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising. However, it is not sufficient in itself. The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers. In my opinion, advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons. We are mainly introduced to products through advertisements. Therefore, advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product. When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised, they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases. Recently, there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV. The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot. As a result of this, the number of that product being sold will increases. Also, the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media, the more popular the product becomes. Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product. Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product. When a product is commonly used, it becomes trustworthy for the society, no matter what quality it is. However, it also has to be affordable for the consumer. Considering this fact, advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised. They make the product preferable. In conclusion, as I believe that consumers should consider major needs when they purchase goods, high sales are obviously a reflection of the powerful advertisements.;"In the contemporary marketplace, it is undeniable that advertisement strategies play a crucial role in driving sales and generating consumer interest. However, while effective advertising can significantly boost product visibility and appeal, it is not the sole factor influencing high sales. I agree to a considerable extent that good advertisement strategies are essential for high sales, but I believe there are other factors at play as well.Firstly, a well-executed advertising campaign can create a strong brand identity and capture the attention of the target audience. For instance, companies like Apple and Nike have famously employed innovative marketing techniques, utilizing emotional appeal and storytelling, which have elevated their products to cultural icons. Such advertisements do not just inform consumers about a product; they create an aspirational narrative that encourages purchases. However, one cannot overlook the importance of product quality and customer satisfaction. In many cases, it is the product itself that ultimately drives sales. If a product fails to meet consumer expectations, even the most eye-catching advertisements cannot sustain high sales in the long term. Consumer reviews, word-of-mouth recommendations, and overall product performance play significant roles in building loyalty and repeat purchases. Moreover, pricing strategies and distribution channels also impact sales. For example, a product priced too high may deter potential buyers, regardless of the advertisement's effectiveness. Likewise, easy availability through various distribution channels ensures that consumers can readily purchase the product, further influencing sales.In conclusion, while good advertisement strategies are undoubtedly important for maximizing high sales, they are part of a larger puzzle. A successful marketing strategy must also encompass product quality, pricing, and distribution to achieve lasting success in the competitive marketplace. Therefore, while I agree that effective advertising significantly contributes to sales, it is essential to recognize the multifaceted nature of the factors involved."
21;Some people believe a country will benefit greatly by a high percentage of young people go to university. Others argue that it only leads to unemployment. Discuss both and give your own opinion.;"Persistent deliberation is happening as to whether it is desirable for the youth to go to university. In regard to the development of the country, some people believe that it is essential for young students to get high quality of education in universities, while others think that it is only one of causes to increase the rate of unemployment. In this essay, I will analyze both views first in order to come up with a fool-proof decision.To begin with, those who advocate the impracticability of university have several reasons. From their point of view, the fact is that there are numerous job opportunities for those who do not have the certification of university graduation, such as mechanics, sales persons, or engineers, and, furthermore, labors for graduates are in short supply. What is worse, the labor market for highly educated students is now too competitive to get a job after finishing their studying. In this regard it is a loss of national productivity that young people spend much time on searching for high salary jobs, even can be a sheer time-consuming.However, on the other side of the coin are voices in the opposition, saying that universities provide not only skills for careers, but also academic knowledge for the human race, such as bio science, politics, and medicine. These academic values are necessary to the progress of the world. More importantly, many researches in the ivory-tower have created ingenious discoveries and achievements for the development of modern society. Another significant factor of universities is that diverse experiences in the campus life can make the young generation more competently because there are a number of chances through internships, deeper discussion, independent life, and exchange scholarships.To sum up both contentions about the necessity of universities' education have reasonable justifications; however, I agree with the latter view. Although higher education does not guarantee young students' success, the benefits of learning in universities are the vital factor in creating more possibilities for the development of society through advancing academic fulfillment and the young generation who have experiences and challenges.";The debate surrounding the benefits and drawbacks of a high percentage of young people attending university has garnered considerable attention. Proponents argue that higher education plays a pivotal role in fostering economic growth, innovation, and societal progress. They contend that a well-educated workforce is essential for driving productivity and competitiveness in an increasingly globalized economy. When young people acquire specialized skills and knowledge through university education, they contribute to the development of advanced industries and technologies, ultimately enhancing a nation's capacity for growth. Additionally, universities often serve as incubators for innovation, where students engage in research and entrepreneurial activities that can lead to breakthroughs with significant economic implications.On the other hand, critics argue that a surge in university attendance can result in a saturated job market, leading to an oversupply of graduates in fields with limited employment opportunities. This scenario is particularly evident in regions where the labor market cannot absorb the rising number of degree holders. Consequently, many graduates find themselves underemployed or working in jobs that do not require a university degree. This situation not only leads to increased rates of unemployment for young people but also raises concerns about the return on investment for individuals who incur substantial student debt without commensurate job prospects. Moreover, the emphasis on university education may detract from vocational training and apprenticeships, which are equally crucial for a well-rounded economy.In my opinion, while a high percentage of young people going to university can lead to substantial benefits for a country, it is essential to strike a balance. Education systems should promote diverse pathways, including vocational training and apprenticeships, to ensure that all young people have access to fulfilling career opportunities. By doing so, countries can harness the potential of their youth without falling prey to the pitfalls of unemployment and underemployment.
22;There are social, medical and technical problems associated with the use of mobile phones. What form do these problems take? Do problems of using mobile phones outweigh the benefits?;Nowadays, the popularity of mobile phones has brought about a lot of convenience but at the meanwhile a variety of problems as well, such as social, medical and technical problems. However, I do not think these disadvantages will outweigh the advantages brought by cell phones. In this essay, I would like to analyze these three issues in order to support my viewpoint.First of all, almost everything that changed our lifestyle a lot will also cause some social problems. Mobile phones are not out of expectation. Speaking loudly on the phone in public areas, such as schools, libraries and hospitals appears to be very impolite and offensive. What is worse, some students utilize their cell phones as an effective cheating tools in examinations in which they can send and receive answers by texting each other. Nevertheless, it is not impossible to solve these problems, as long as some regulations and rules can be effectively implemented.It is also worth mentioning that some harmful effects on our health are lethal. It has been proved that overusing of the electronic devices including mobile phones could lead to higher possibility of suffering hearing loss and even cancers, although the further investigation are needed.Another debatable problem is about techniques. There is panic among people that their conversation can be intercepted by the third party. This possibility exists all the time. But a more efficient and reliable system can also be invented to guarantee the private information of users.Moreover, the mobile phone has become a dispensable multifunctional tools in people's daily life. Not only used for communication, but it also functions as an Internet browser, a music player, a personal organizer and so forth.In conclusion, nothing can be overused without side effects. The contribution of the mobile phone to our modern society is prominent and people's dependence on it is irreversible, although it has a number of problems that should be well handled.;"Mobile phones have become an indispensable part of modern life, offering unparalleled convenience and connectivity. However, their widespread use has introduced several social, medical, and technical problems that warrant careful consideration.Socially, mobile phones contribute to a decline in face-to-face interactions. As individuals become more engrossed in their devices, interpersonal communication suffers, leading to a dilution of social skills. Relationships can become strained, as the quality of time spent together diminishes when individuals are preoccupied with their screens. Moreover, mobile phones can facilitate cyberbullying and contribute to mental health issues, particularly among younger users who may feel the pressure of social media portrayals.From a medical standpoint, the excessive use of mobile phones has been associated with various health concerns. One prominent issue is the rise of ""text neck,"" a condition caused by poor posture when looking down at devices for extended periods. Additionally, prolonged screen time can lead to eye strain and disrupted sleep patterns as blue light emitted from screens interferes with melatonin production. There are ongoing debates regarding the potential long-term effects of radiation exposure from mobile phones, although definitive conclusions are still elusive.Technically, the reliance on mobile phones has raised concerns about privacy and security. The vast amount of personal data stored on smartphones makes them prime targets for cyberattacks, leading to identity theft and breaches of sensitive information. Furthermore, reliance on mobile technology can create vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure, as systems increasingly depend on mobile connectivity for functionality and communication.In weighing the problems associated with mobile phone use against their benefits, it is clear that while mobile phones enhance communication, convenience, and access to information, the accompanying social, medical, and technical challenges cannot be ignored. Striking a balance between harnessing the advantages of mobile phones and mitigating their adverse effects is crucial for a healthier, more socially cohesive society. Thus, the problems, while significant, can be managed through responsible usage and greater awareness."
23;Using computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on your children? do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, thanks to the development of technology, computer is now indispensable to life. Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently. In my opinion, the latter opinion is true.First, using computer constantly has bad influence on children's eyes. When they concentrate on computer for too long, their eyes will get tired, which is the main reason for some eyes problems, typically shortsighted.Moreover, children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills, they will know little about the outside life. It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear dangerous consequences. For instance, several teenagers play games without rest, which leads to health depression, a typical example is the death of Korean gamer, who had a non-stop playing for 3 days.Finally, even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much. Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose, most of them are attracted by facebook, blog, etc. instead. Due to this neglect, they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet, they will have no time for their studying.In conclusion, although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life, it still has its bad side, especially for children. People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose.;In today's digital age, the prevalence of computers has become a cornerstone of daily life, affecting not only adults but also children. While undeniably, there are positive aspects to computer usage, I firmly believe that the negative effects often outweigh the positive when it comes to children.Firstly, excessive computer use can lead to a variety of health issues. Children who spend prolonged hours in front of screens are at a higher risk of developing conditions such as obesity due to a sedentary lifestyle. Additionally, problems such as poor posture, eye strain, and sleep disturbances are increasingly common among tech-savvy youngsters. These health repercussions can impede their overall development and well-being.Moreover, the social implications of daily computer usage are concerning. Children who heavily engage with computers tend to have less face-to-face interaction with peers, which hampers their social skills and emotional intelligence. The reliance on virtual communication can lead to difficulties in forming genuine connections, increasing feelings of isolation and loneliness. This detachment from real-world relationships can have long-lasting negative effects on their ability to navigate social situations in adulthood.Furthermore, the potential exposure to inappropriate content is a significant downside. The internet is rife with material that is unsuitable for children, ranging from violent imagery to cyberbullying. Without proper supervision, children can easily stumble upon harmful content that can affect their mental health and worldviews.In contrast, while computers can offer educational resources and skills development, these benefits can often be accessed in more controlled and limited doses. Encouraging a balanced approach to technology—where children are engaged in various activities beyond screens—can foster healthier habits.In conclusion, while computers have their advantages, the negative implications of their daily use by children are more pronounced. It is crucial for parents to regulate computer usage and prioritize alternative, enriching activities to ensure balanced development.
24;Large factory near your community. Advantages and disadvantages of this new influence on your community.;Nowadays, whether to establish large factories nearby housing areas has become a controversial issue in our society. Out of the case of economic development, industrial buildings are a necessary part of modern society. However a vast number of people are against building a factory near their community because of pollution. From my point of view, the advantages of building a factory will outweigh its disadvantages, if we tackle the environmental problems brought by factories.First of all, a large factory can stimulate local economic growth and reduce the unemployment rate. To manufacture goods, there must be the demand of laborers, from which the local residents can benefit. What is more, the factory is not isolated, other industries and business will be quickly established, resulting in economic growth of local area. For example, the estate industry will be boosted in order to satisfy the workers' accommodation need.The main disadvantage is contamination. It is true that some area are suffering the dire consequences caused by overdeveloping the industry, such as water pollution, overcrowded traffic and medical problems. For instance, in some industrial cities, a large proportion of the workers are suffering various breathing problems, such as asthma which can be caused by waste ashes and certain chemical substances.However, it is inevitable that there will be more factories built with the development of our society. Therefore, how to improve the disadvantages of building a factory would be more important than whether to build it. In fact most problems can be avoidable if the factories put in real and great effort to manage their waste well.In conclusion, installation of manufacturing plant is a trend of industrialization for many countries. Its advantages will outweigh disadvantages as long as the factories dispose their waste and pollution in the correct way.;The establishment of a large factory near a community can bring about a mix of advantages and disadvantages, each significantly shaping the local environment and the lives of its residents. On the positive side, industrial expansion often generates substantial economic benefits. The new factory is likely to create numerous job opportunities, from production line positions to managerial roles, thus reducing local unemployment rates. This influx of employment can stimulate economic growth, leading to increased disposable income among residents, who may in turn spend more within the community, supporting local businesses and services. Additionally, factories often contribute to local infrastructure development, such as improved roads and public transport, which can enhance overall quality of life.However, these advantages come with several drawbacks that can affect community well-being. One of the most pressing concerns is environmental impact. Factories can lead to increased pollution, including air and water contaminants, which pose risks to public health and local ecosystems. The noise from machinery can also disrupt the tranquility of the community, contributing to stress and potentially lowering property values. Furthermore, rapid industrialization can strain local resources, such as water supply and energy, which may lead to conflicts over resource management.Socially, the presence of a large factory can create a divide in the community. While some individuals benefit from the employment opportunities, others may feel marginalized if they do not share in the advantages. This disparity can foster resentment and social tension, altering community dynamics.In conclusion, while the establishment of a large factory near a community can bring economic benefits and development, it also presents significant challenges, particularly concerning environmental impact and social cohesion. A balanced approach, involving active community engagement and sustainable practices, is essential to mitigate these disadvantages and ensure that the factory serves as a positive force in the community.
25;Food is now easier to prepare. Is this a good thing?;Nowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.First of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.Not cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food. Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up.In addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.In conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing. Cooking is not a waste of time, contrarily, it is crucial for our health and culture.;In recent years, the preparation of food has become noticeably easier due to advancements in technology and shifts in societal norms. From pre-packaged meals to user-friendly kitchen gadgets, the culinary landscape has evolved significantly. While the convenience of easy food preparation offers undeniable advantages, it also raises important questions about its implications for health, culture, and lifestyle.On one hand, the ease of preparing meals has democratized cooking, allowing individuals with varying skill levels to create dishes with minimal effort. Busy individuals and families benefit from time-saving options that cater to their hectic schedules. The advent of meal kits, which provide pre-measured ingredients and step-by-step instructions, has made it possible for anyone to enjoy home-cooked meals without the stress of planning and shopping. This shift can lead to healthier eating, as families might choose to prepare meals at home rather than opt for fast food or take-out.However, the widespread availability of convenience foods can have drawbacks. Many pre-packaged meals are high in preservatives, sodium, and unhealthy fats, potentially leading to negative health outcomes over time. Moreover, the reliance on easy-to-prepare options can diminish culinary skills and knowledge, particularly among younger generations. Cooking is not only a practical skill but also a cultural cornerstone that fosters creativity, family bonds, and an appreciation for diverse cuisines. As food preparation becomes less demanding, there is a risk that people will lose touch with these vital aspects of gastronomy.In conclusion, while the ease of food preparation can lead to healthier choices and save time, it is essential to balance convenience with nutritional awareness and cultural appreciation. Emphasizing cooking as both a life skill and an art form can ensure that society benefits from modern conveniences without sacrificing health and tradition. Ultimately, the relationship between ease and the quality of our food experience must be critically examined to foster a healthier future.
26;The best and only way to assist developing countries is to provide them with financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;As is commonly understood, there is an increasingly gap between developed countries and developing countries. It can be seen that some developed countries and organization are proving financial assistance to the impoverished countries. However, it is disagreed that this can be the best and only way to assist developing countries. This will be proven by analyzing the necessity of developing their education and the real objective of supporters.Firstly, education is an essential part in development. For instance, most developing countries are lack of educational resources, such as experienced teachers, evaluation systems and teaching facilities, which is usually neglected by local authorities. From this example, it is obvious that if the developed countries are unwilling to share their successful experience in education, the developing countries will remain undeveloped, even though they gain a great deal of economic support. Thus, the critical method to improve the condition of poor countries is to help them build up a complete educational system instead of financial aid.In addition, it is well acknowledged that there is no free lunch in the world. This means some powerful countries provide financial support in order to acquire the right to exploit the local resources and target the local labour market. Indeed, they rarely provide local residents with any technological aid and even cause contamination in some areas. Therefore, developing countries should not totally depend on the financial support from powerful countries.In conclusion, financial aid is not the only way to assist poor countries. And it has been proven that developing education and improving national technology and science level are the path they have to undergo if they really want to alter current situation.;"The assertion that the best and only way to assist developing countries is through financial aid is a contentious one that merits a nuanced exploration. While financial assistance plays a crucial role in the developmental trajectory of poorer nations, it is by no means a comprehensive solution. Undoubtedly, financial aid can provide immediate relief and facilitate various projects in education, healthcare, and infrastructure that are pivotal for development. For instance, international aid has often been the lifeblood for desperate situations, such as during natural disasters or pandemics. Such financial support can enable developing countries to stabilize their economies, alleviate poverty, and invest in essential services.However, relying solely on financial aid presents significant drawbacks. Often, foreign aid can create a dependency cycle that discourages self-sufficiency and local innovation. Furthermore, not all financial assistance is effective; mismanagement, corruption, or failure to address the root causes of poverty can render aid futile. Without proper governance and accountability, funds may not reach those who need them or may be diverted entirely.A more holistic approach to assistance involves combining financial aid with capacity building, technological transfer, and trade facilitation. Investments in education, infrastructure, and governance reforms can foster long-term growth and empowerment. By strengthening local institutions and economies, developing countries can cultivate resilience and reduce dependence on external aid.In conclusion, while financial aid is an important tool in the arsenal of assistance for developing countries, it is not the only solution. A multifaceted strategy that includes financial aid alongside development initiatives such as education, governance, and infrastructure improvements is essential for sustainable progress. Hence, I partially agree with the statement; financial aid is vital, but it must be complemented with other forms of support to truly empower developing nations."
27;Society should ban all forms of the advertising because it has no purpose and causes damages. Do you agree or disagree? ;It is no secret that advertising become inseparable part of our modern life. We come across with ads almost everywhere and everyday. Some people argue that companies by advertising their goods or services spend their money for nothing. Other critics say that ads have no purpose, they only cause damages to society and all forms of advertising should be banned. On my part I would like to solve this issue on a different way. Society does need an advertising but it is our responsibility to control the content and what kind of goods and services we would like to offer to our customers.First of all, I do support the idea that advertising alcohol, cigarettes, goods and services with adult content should be prohibited because these kind of ads will have negative effect to our children. Youngsters might be tempted to buy cigarettes or alcohol and later to start consume it on a daily basis. Fortunately, some countries take this issue seriously and advertising alcohol, cigarettes and materials with adult content is banned on those countries.On the other hand by advertising companies, businesses, firms and individuals promote their goods and services. Thanks to ads we learn about new products, we can compare them and choose what’s the best for us.These days, not only many businesses, but also governments have to rely on advertising. For example, tourism makes up one-third of the Czech Republic's economy. In order to promote the country's attractions, the Czech government has to advertise and sell its services to foreign consumers. Only well planned and well targeted advertising will bring more foreign tourists to the country.In conclusion, I think that modern society needs advertising. Ads will keep us well informed about new products and services, but we should also bear in mind that advertising cigarettes and alcohol will definitely affect our children in negative way.;The role of advertising in society is a contentious topic, with strong arguments both for and against its existence. While some advocate for an outright ban on advertising, arguing that it serves no genuine purpose and inflicts harm, I contend that the issue is more nuanced. A complete prohibition would not only be impractical but would also overlook the valuable functions that advertising can serve.Firstly, advertising plays a crucial role in informing consumers. In a fast-paced society laden with choices, advertisements provide information about products and services, enabling consumers to make informed decisions. They highlight new innovations, compare different offerings, and often promote competition among brands, which can lead to better quality and more affordable prices for consumers. By fostering an informed marketplace, advertising serves a legitimate purpose that should not be disregarded.However, it is undeniable that advertising can have detrimental effects. Many forms of advertising, particularly those aimed at children or promoting unhealthy products, can lead to negative societal outcomes, such as poor health choices or the cultivation of unrealistic body images. Additionally, the tactics employed in advertising can sometimes manipulate emotions, leading to impulsive purchasing behaviors and consumerism that prioritizes materialism over more sustainable values.Rather than banning advertising outright, a more balanced approach would involve implementing stricter regulations to mitigate its negative impacts while allowing for its beneficial aspects. Governments and regulatory bodies can enforce guidelines that protect vulnerable populations, like children, and promote positive messaging surrounding health and wellness.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns regarding the quality and impact of advertising, an outright ban would neglect its essential role in contemporary commerce. Instead, society should strive for a framework that encourages responsible advertising, fostering a marketplace that benefits consumers while minimizing potential harm.
28;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think that women should work to earn money whereas other people belief that women should care about household. What's your opinion?;Personally, I believe that married women nowadays have right to take up jobs like men when employment discrimination based on gender have been erased significantly. Working outside home will bring a lot of benefits to both married woman and their household. I will mention some basic reasons as following.Firstly, extra income that women earn will contribute to their family's expenses. By taking up a job, a wife can earn more money to support her family life. This is really necessary in cases of her husband's low salary and the difficulty of getting a good job at the present. So, it is a normal practice for women to be helpmates in earning money.Secondly, working outside the house creates opportunities for married women to contact with the outer world, strengthen their character and show their capacity. These things in turn will make them more confident, independent. These women will set a good example for their children. Therefore, it is no doubt that they play roles as a mother and as a wife better.Last but not least, nowadays, there are many supporting conditions that help women balance housework and work. Besides the gorvernment's policies on limited families and their husbands' sharing in the housework, many employers are willing to offer part-time jobs for women.In conclusion, a well-organized home does not need the housewife's presence the whole day long and married women could go to work in order to enjoy the working life outside the home.;In contemporary society, the landscape of gender roles has significantly transformed, offering women an array of opportunities that were largely inaccessible in the past. Deliberations around whether women should focus on careers or domestic responsibilities generate diverse opinions, yet it is crucial to balance both perspectives rather than adhering to a rigid dichotomy.Historically, women were often relegated to household duties, seen predominantly as caregivers and homemakers. However, with advancements in education and the workforce's evolution, women now have the chance to excel in various professional fields, thereby contributing to the economy and society at large. This shift is imperative, as it not only empowers women but also allows families to benefit from dual incomes, enhancing their financial stability and independence. Moreover, the representation of women in various sectors can challenge traditional gender norms, inspiring future generations to pursue their aspirations without restrictions based on gender.Conversely, the assertion that women should primarily focus on household responsibilities is rooted in cultural and societal expectations that continue to persist in many communities. While nurturing and maintaining a household is undeniably valuable, this viewpoint may overlook the potential for women to contribute both at home and in the workplace. Many women successfully manage to juggle both roles, showcasing resilience and multifaceted capabilities. In conclusion, the discussion on whether women should work or focus on household duties is not about choosing one over the other but about recognizing the right of women to make choices that best suit their lives and aspirations. Encouraging equal opportunities allows women to thrive in both domestic settings and professional arenas, ultimately leading to a more balanced and progressive society. Each woman's journey is unique, and the emphasis should be on flexibility and support for their choices, paving the way for a future where women can embrace all facets of life.
29;The government has to provide primary and secondary education, but for university education either students or their parents should pay. To what extent do you agree?;"Primary and secondary education provide a basic knowledge and skills to the people in this world. I completely agree that government should provide those education to their people; however, for the more higher education like university, the students or their parents should pay for the fees.Some parents might not have enough money to pay for their children university fees. In the other hand, I don't think it is also fair for the government as the government has been paying a lot of money for their students' primary and secondary education. It is better for them to use the money to pay for the other students' education so that all people in their country could receive the same education.Moreover, students that already have a basic knowledge and education can get a part-time job and they can pay for their own studies when their parent could not afford to pay it. They will be more responsible with their studies when they pay the fees themselves. In addition to that, the students will become more independent and it will build their characters in the marketplace as well.Furthermore, this will encourage all the parents to think of the way to help their children to achieve more in their lives as they need to make some contribution too for their children future.In conclusion, I completely agree that government should not pay for the university fees because this will make both the parents and students in charge for their future themselves not just depend on the government to do all their responsibilities for them.";"The question of whether the government should bear the financial responsibility for university education, while primary and secondary education remains free, is a contentious topic in the realm of educational policy. While I acknowledge the substantial arguments on both sides, I largely agree with the notion that students or their parents should contribute to university education costs.To begin with, primary and secondary education serves as a fundamental right and the bedrock of societal progress. It is essential for the development of informed citizens and plays a vital role in reducing inequality. In contrast, university education, while important, often benefits individuals in more specific and varied ways. Graduates tend to secure higher-paying jobs and thus are in a position to shoulder some of the financial burdens associated with their advanced education. This principle of personal responsibility aligns with the idea that individuals should invest in their futures; education is often a significant catalyst for career advancement.Moreover, requiring students or their parents to contribute to university education can enhance the perceived value of the degree. When individuals invest their resources—whether in tuition fees, living expenses, or other costs—they may approach their education with greater seriousness and commitment. Essential fiscal responsibility teaches students valuable life skills that extend beyond academics.However, it is crucial to consider the socioeconomic factors at play. Many students may face financial barriers that hinder their access to higher education, leading to a greater divide between the privileged and the disadvantaged. Thus, while I favor an approach where students or families contribute to university costs, this system should be complemented by robust scholarship and financial aid programs that ensure education remains accessible to all, regardless of their socioeconomic status.In conclusion, while the government should unequivocally fund primary and secondary education, a shared responsibility in funding university education is reasonable. It promotes personal investment in one’s future while carefully addressing the financial inequalities that persist in society."
30;The first car appeared on British roads in 1888. By the year 2000 there may be as many as 29million vehicles on British roads. Alternative forms of transport should be encouraged and international laws introduced to control car ownership and use. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Recently, a great deal of attention has been paid to means of transportation. Some state that automobile is the most convenient transportation, while others assert that alternative forms of transport should be considered in view of environmental pollution. In my opinion, I strongly agree that alternative means of transportation and international laws in controlling automobiles should be introduced. In this essay, several reasons will be described carefully in the following passages.Firstly, an increase in the number of automobiles brings about environmental pollution. Since automobile exhaust and carbon dioxides emission have bad impacts on the air, the air gets to be polluted and it causes respiratory disease of the local inhabitants. Therefore, it is crucial to alter automobiles to the other means of transportation and to legislate to control automobiles.Secondly, an increase in the number of automobiles causes terrible traffic congestion. Once we get into the traffic jam, it forces us to waste our time for a while. What is worse, traffic congestion irritates drivers and as a result, it leads to an increase of traffic accidents. Thus, the methods to reduce the number of automobiles and to control car ownership and use should be immediately planned and implemented.In order to solve these problems, alternative forms of transportation and international laws to control automobiles ownership and use can work effectively. With regard to the former, alternative forms which emit less carbon dioxides and gasses than automobiles are ideal. For example, rental bicycle system has been introduced in several European countries. This system is that at the corner of each district, the rental bicycles are placed and the people can ride it to the other districts with a small fee. Since bicycle expels neither carbon dioxides nor harmful gasses, it is a better form to protect environment than automobile. As for the latter point, the introduction of international laws can be also effective. For instance, there are some regulations to limit the use of automobiles by time and to allow the people possess one car only. Thus, these attempts to reduce automobiles can ease traffic congestion and environmental pollution.In summary, even though some people claim the convenience of automobile, I would state that alternative forms of transport and international laws on controlling automobiles are necessary due to the environmental protection and the alleviation of traffic congestion.;The journey of automobiles in the UK, beginning with the first car in 1888, reflects a remarkable evolution in transport that has dramatically reshaped society. By the year 2000, projections indicated the potential for 29 million vehicles on British roads, raising important considerations about sustainability, environmental impact, and urban congestion. In light of these challenges, I largely agree that alternative forms of transport should be encouraged, and that international laws should be introduced to regulate car ownership and usage.Firstly, the proliferation of vehicles contributes significantly to air pollution and climate change. The internal combustion engine has long been associated with greenhouse gas emissions, which are a primary driver of global warming. Encouraging alternative forms of transport, such as cycling, walking, and public transit, can alleviate some of these environmental concerns. For instance, investing in extensive bike lanes and improving the reliability and reach of public transport could foster a shift away from car dependency, benefiting public health and contributing to cleaner air.Moreover, international laws to control car ownership could address the socioeconomic disparities that often accompany vehicle ownership. In many urban areas, car ownership is tied to privilege, leading to inequitable access to employment and resources. Regulations might include stricter emissions standards, vehicle registration limits, or incentivization for individuals to use alternative transport modes. Such measures could promote a more equitable transport environment and encourage a cultural shift towards sustainable practices.Despite the recognition of the automobile’s convenience and necessity for certain demographics, it is critical to balance these needs with the broader responsibility towards our environment and society. Ultimately, promoting alternative forms of transport and introducing regulations on car use are essential steps in crafting a sustainable future, ensuring that our roads are not only filled with vehicles but are safe, healthy, and accessible for all.
31;Rich countries should provide financial help to poor contries. To what extend to you agree or disagree?;"In this world, there is no one who does not know this world 'globalization', which means the world are more closer, and every single countries affects each other more than before in many ways. That is why governmental and non-governmental organizations have been focus on being harmony and contribute to aid to poor countries. It is true that just giving aid to impoverished countries could be manipulated by big power countries. In addition, a great amount of materials and money have poor countries being corrupted and politically dependent on other countries. However, I agree that aiding poor countries has positive effects, overweighing its side-effects for the several reasons.First of all, poor counties suffer from shortage of basic materials and facilities to start businesses and make it richer. To be out of poverty, it is fundamental to support basic industry related factors such as light, electricity, load, highways, natural resources, technology and buildings for companies. Aiding help poor countries in this situation solve their economical problems and run their own business. In actual, republic of Korea used to be the poorest country even compared to others in Africa in 1960's. Now that it has became strong economy country aiding poor countries after 10 years of aid from other counties.Secondly, aiding campaign gives a chance to considerate about poor people. If people in rich countries ponder poor people suffering from poverty and diseases, they would never take their abundance for granted. It not only raises the notice the meaning of harmony and love, but also be a good chance to learn humane doctrine of globalization.Third, the campaigns might include practical benefits. In globalized world, the economies of several countries are in a big network and must influence on each others. When America mortgage loan system went bad, several economies of European and Asian countries fluctuated, even any countries had to be gotten international supports to block its bankrupt.In conclusion, there are abovementioned three key points of positive effects of aid; supporting poor countries to make its economy strong and building humane concepts to people, keeping strong global economy. I strongly believe that being a global neighbor by aiding poor countries would be continues by many organizations and volunteers, and it will make the earth a better place to live.";The debate surrounding whether rich countries should provide financial assistance to poorer nations has garnered significant attention in recent years. I strongly agree that affluent countries have a moral obligation to help less developed nations. This sentiment is rooted in ethical considerations, economic interdependence, and global stability.Firstly, the stark disparities in wealth across the globe call for a compassionate response from richer countries. Many impoverished nations grapple with severe challenges, including inadequate healthcare, poor education systems, and insufficient infrastructure. By providing financial aid, wealthier nations can contribute to sustainable development initiatives that aim to alleviate poverty, improve living standards, and enhance access to vital services. The ripple effect of such support not only transforms the lives of individuals but also fosters a more equitable global society.Secondly, the global economy is increasingly interconnected, and the stability of wealthy nations is often linked to the prosperity of poorer countries. Economic turmoil in developing nations can lead to increased migration, political instability, and security threats, which ultimately affects rich countries. Investing in the development of poorer nations can foster economic growth, leading to new markets for products and services, thus benefiting both parties. By promoting stability and economic growth in developing regions, rich countries can ensure a more prosperous and secure global environment.Lastly, the pressing issues of climate change and pandemics depict the urgency of global collaboration. Wealthier nations possess the resources, technology, and expertise needed to support poorer countries in tackling these challenges. Failure to address these issues collectively could worsen global inequalities and pose risks for all nations.In conclusion, the financial assistance provided by rich countries to poorer nations is a vital step towards achieving global equity, improving international relations, and ensuring a sustainable future. The approach should aim not just to alleviate immediate suffering but also to empower these nations for long-term self-sufficiency.
32;Even though globalization affects the world's economics in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"During the history of the world, every change has its own positive and negative sides. Globalization as a gradual change affecting all over the world is not an exception. Although it has undeniable effects on the economics of the world; it has side effects which make it a controversial issue.Some people prefer to recognize globalization as a threat to ethnic and religious values of people of their country. They think that the idea of globalization put their inherited culture in danger of uncontrolled change and make them vulnerable against the attack of imperialistic governments.Those who disagree, believe that globalization contribute effectively to the global improvement of the world in many aspects. Developing globalization, people can have more access to many natural resources of the world and it leads to increasing the pace of scientific and economic promotions of the entire world. In addition, they admit that globalization can be considered a chance for people of each country to promote their lifestyle through the stuffs and services imported from other countries.Moreover, the proponents of globalization idea point out globalization results in considerable decrease in global tension due to convergence of benefits of people of the world which is a natural consequence of globalization.In conclusion, I would rather classify myself in the proponents of globalization as a speeding factor of global progress. I think it is more likely to solve the problems of the world rather than intensifying them.";Globalization is often hailed as a powerful force for economic growth, connectivity, and cultural exchange. It has facilitated international trade, increased competition, and generated economic opportunities, particularly in developing nations. However, while the positive impacts of globalization are significant, it is essential to recognize and address its negative consequences to fully understand its implications on the world's economies.On one hand, proponents of globalization argue that it has led to unparalleled economic benefits. By allowing countries to specialize in their areas of comparative advantage, globalization enhances efficiency and productivity. For example, nations that are rich in natural resources can export these goods while importing technology and manufactured products from more industrialized countries. This interdependence among nations often results in economic growth, job creation, and an improvement in living standards.On the other hand, the darker side of globalization cannot be overlooked. One of the most pressing issues is the widening economic inequality within and between countries. While some regions flourish, others may suffer, leading to further disparities in wealth distribution. Additionally, the race to the bottom in labor standards and environmental regulations can occur, as multinational companies seek to maximize profits by exploiting cheaper labor and lax regulations in poorer nations. This can result in poor working conditions, human rights abuses, and environmental degradation.Moreover, globalization can lead to cultural homogenization, where local traditions and identities risk being overshadowed by dominant global cultures. This not only threatens cultural diversity but can also give rise to social discontent and greater political instability.In conclusion, while globalization provides numerous economic advantages, its accompanying negative effects must be acknowledged. A balanced approach that leverages the benefits of globalization while ensuring protections for workers, the environment, and local cultures is imperative to creating a more equitable and sustainable global economy.
33;Many children are forced to stay at school and study subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. These children may disrupt the education of the majority and should be allowed to leave school early to find a themselves a job. What are your views?;Many people believe that children should study at school to have more knowledge that prepare better for their future. Others, however, think that these children may disrupt their school work and should be allowed to leave school early to find a job. Personally, I tend to agree with the point of view that student have to be forced to study at school.First of all, schools offer to students a good environment with experienced professors and high quality programs for studying. It creates the best conditions for students education and can force them to focus on their school work instead of wasting their time to do useless things. Second of all, schools provide lots of academic knowledge to students. Students may learn professional skills, expand their understandings and gain experiences. Therefore, they have more opprotunities to find a job and to be successful in the future. For example, as we know, employer always prefer to hire an employee of high degree who have professional skills.Nevertheless, it is not unreasonable that some people think that children should interrupt their school work and get a job. Whether children can learn a lot at school, there are many subjects that will be of little value to them in the future. Furthermore, children can learn social skills when they have a job. They can get more experiences that can not be obtained at school. Working helps children be more independent and teach them to esteem and manage the money that they've earned.Overall, I believe that students should study at school. Even though there are some advantages of leaving school to find a job, studying at school is always the best choice for children's future. There are many ways that can train children to learn independent and social skills instead of getting a job.;The debate surrounding the necessity of certain subjects in school curricula and the potential for early school leaving has garnered significant attention in recent years. While it is true that some students may feel disengaged from their studies due to a perceived lack of relevance, advocating for early school leavers can overlook the broader implications of education.Firstly, education serves multiple roles beyond mere job preparation. It fosters critical thinking, creativity, and the ability to engage with diverse ideas. Subjects that may seem irrelevant to some, such as literature or mathematics, are essential in developing a well-rounded individual capable of navigating complex societal challenges. For instance, literature cultivates empathy and cultural awareness, while mathematics enhances problem-solving skills applicable in various contexts. Moreover, allowing students to leave school prematurely based on current interests could result in a significant loss of learning opportunities. Young individuals often lack the foresight to understand how today's seemingly useless subjects may benefit them later in life. Exposure to various fields of knowledge can ignite passions and open doors to unexpected career paths that a narrow focus might hinder. Additionally, permitting early exits from school could exacerbate educational inequities. Students from less privileged backgrounds may be more likely to opt for work, often in low-paying, unfulfilling jobs that perpetuate the cycle of poverty. An education system that encourages premature departure risks reinforcing societal inequalities while also potentially diminishing the workforce's overall skill level.In conclusion, while it's important to consider students' interests and make education more relevant, pushing for early school exits could have detrimental effects. A more balanced approach would be to reform curricula to include practical and vocational training while ensuring that fundamental skills and knowledge remain accessible to all students, preparing them not just for jobs, but for life.
34;Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we can see advertisements everywhere, from television set to posters on the streets. Some people believe that these various advertisements get people to buy products that are unnecessary and only look good on television. I tend to agree with this view.To boost their sales and win over customers, companies pour a great amount of money into advertising. Most of the time, it is not about the function or quality of the commodities themselves but really the promotion of the good feeling of possessing the product. By which I mean, huge cooperation hire celebrities as the face of their product. By casting famous singers in their television advertisement, motorcycles or clothes for example, sales increase significantly since youngsters, as the target consumers, love celebrities. Since having these products shows their status, the quality obviously is not relatively important.However, despite the fact that advertisements can be falseful and exaggerated, it is also true that it plays and important role economically. They introduce new products, and provide various choices, not to mention they are often visually enjoyable, since they aim to grab your attention. Advertising also helps to keep prices at reasonable levels, creates a fair environment for commercial competition. Otherwise the market may be monopolistic, and the price as well as the choice will not be so selective.The power of advertising maybe over-rated, we can not deny that the final decision is on the hands of us consumers. No matter how appealing the advertisements are, we should be able to make the decision on our own.;The assertion that high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising rather than actual societal needs is a topic of considerable debate. I largely agree with this viewpoint, as advertising significantly shapes consumer perceptions and desires, often eclipsing genuine needs in the marketplace.In contemporary society, advertising plays a pivotal role in influencing consumer behavior. Companies employ sophisticated marketing strategies that evoke emotional responses, create brand loyalty, and stimulate desires for products that may not be essential for daily living. For example, fashion brands utilize celebrity endorsements and social media influencers to promote their goods as symbols of status and identity. This often results in consumers purchasing items not out of necessity but due to the desire to fit in or impress others. Consequently, the high sales figures of these products may reflect a successful advertising campaign rather than a reflection of genuine need.Moreover, the consumer culture fostered by advertising perpetuates a cycle where individuals feel compelled to acquire the latest goods to maintain social relevance. This phenomenon can be observed in technology, where consumers eagerly await new smartphone releases, not because their current devices are inadequate, but often because they are persuaded by advertising that they should have the latest model, which is marketed as essential.However, it is important to acknowledge that some level of advertising does serve a purpose in informing consumers about genuinely beneficial products that meet their needs. For example, ads for household essentials or health-related products can help consumers make informed decisions that improve their quality of life. Yet, the overarching influence of advertising tends to skew perceptions of necessity towards a culture of overconsumption.In conclusion, while there are cases where advertising effectively highlights real needs, I believe that the overwhelming tendency is for advertising to manipulate consumer desires, leading to high sales of goods driven more by marketing prowess than true societal needs.
35;Why should the ownership of guns be limited?;Gun is definitely not a kind of normal good in our society, which is strictly controlled in most countries. However, gun control in some countries is relatively loose than others. Therefore, this is still a controversial topic around the world. From my point of view, it is sensible to enforce the gun control.The first factor considered is the risk of accidents with guns. The accidents cannot be completely avoided although only those who have gun licenses can purchase guns. For example, we hear some news from time to time that someone was hurt by accident during the hunting. So the fewer guns possessed, the fewer accidents would happened, our surroundings would be safer with lower accident rates.Secondly, most violent crimes are related to the abuse of guns, especially in some countries where guns are available for people. Eventually, guns will create a violent society if the trend continues. Take an example, in American, young adults and even juveniles can get access to guns, which leads to the tragedies of school gun shooting. What is worse, some terrorists are able to possess more advanced weapons than the police, which makes citizens always live in danger.Thirdly, the possession of guns can also raise the rates of suicide. In the US, firearms remain the most common method of suicide, accounting for about 50 per cent. Unfortunately, there is an increasing trend of adolescent suicides and suicides among those age 75 and over.In conclusion, considering the rise in accident rates, violent crime rates and suicide rates, I support that the guns should be strictly limited and the government should enforce a series of laws to prevent our societies from violence.;The debate surrounding gun ownership is complex and multifaceted, but a compelling argument can be made for limiting this ownership to enhance public safety and reduce violence. First and foremost, statistics show a correlation between high rates of gun ownership and increased instances of gun-related deaths. Countries that impose strict gun control measures typically experience dramatically lower rates of homicides and suicides, leading to the conclusion that limiting access to firearms could lead to similar outcomes.One key reason for limiting gun ownership is the prevention of gun violence. In places with less stringent regulations, firearms often fall into the hands of individuals who may misuse them, including those with mental health issues or histories of violence. By implementing stricter background checks and restrictions, it becomes more challenging for these individuals to acquire guns, thereby preventing potential tragedies.Moreover, limiting gun ownership can enhance community safety. The proliferation of guns can lead to a culture of fear and mistrust among citizens. When people believe that those around them may be armed, it can exacerbate tensions and lead to situations escalating into violence more rapidly. Communities can feel safer when fewer individuals possess firearms, allowing for more productive interactions and fostering a cooperative environment.Another crucial aspect is the potential for harm within homes. Research indicates that households with firearms are significantly more likely to experience accidental shootings, domestic violence, and suicides. By limiting gun ownership, especially in homes with children or individuals at risk of harming themselves, we can reduce the tragic outcomes that often arise from unregulated access to firearms.In conclusion, limiting gun ownership is crucial for enhancing public safety. Through responsible policies that seek to balance individual rights with community welfare, society can work towards a future where the risks associated with firearms are mitigated, ultimately leading to safer environments for all.
36;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;International sporting events are a good change to create a multi-nation community of fans having the same passion. It will help people around the world understand each other more. Since, international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.An international sporting event is normal held in a country with huge interest from fans all over the world. For the time of occasions, people regardless of nationality, origin and religion will live together. People can understand more about a country, it is useful to ease tensions between nations. For example in FIFA World Cup 2010, the relation between North Korea and South Korea is dangerous for the warship sinking. The world suspected North Korea of the aggressive action. However, due to this event North Korea showed a friendship and enthuasism. It is rare times when people can learn about this country. It really help to alleviate the tension.Besides easing tensions, an international sporting event also helps fans release patriotic emotions in a safe way. When they garther together to encourage their team, they will show their patriotic emotions. Regardless of the competition between teams, their emotions are always released in a safe way due to the sole passion of the sport. Moreover, all fans know that a sport event will attract the attention of whole the world and a lot of public media. They will try to create a beautiful image about their land and people. In Olympic Beijing 2008, Chinese tried thier best to bring the world a spectacular image about their country. First of all, foreigners came here always received the support of friendly volunteers who were young students. They were welcomed by each Chinese hospitality, beauty in each cities. Everythings is created by patriotic emotions of Chinese who wanted to bring a beautiful China to the world.In conclusion, International sporting events will draw the international concern. It will make the world more peaceful by easing internation tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way.;The assertion that popular sporting events, such as the football World Cup, play a crucial role in easing international tensions and providing a safe outlet for patriotic emotions is one that merits discussion. While some may argue that sports can fuel rivalries and nationalism, I largely agree that these events, when approached with a spirit of camaraderie and competition, can indeed foster global unity and understanding.International sporting occasions serve as a platform for nations to come together, transcending cultural and political divides. During the World Cup, for instance, fans from various countries gather in a shared celebration of the sport, promoting interaction and dialogue among diverse populations. This mingling of cultures allows individuals to appreciate different backgrounds and traditions, often leading to a greater sense of global community. Moreover, the passion that fans exhibit can be channeled into positive expressions of national pride, rather than aggression or hostility.Furthermore, the nature of sport itself focuses on competition rather than conflict. Athletes represent their countries in a pursuit of excellence, creating a spirit of friendly rivalry that often diminishes hostility. The cooperative aspect of sports—players working together towards a common goal—mirrors the potential for collaboration among nations. The World Cup, for instance, becomes a celebration of skills and teamwork, allowing for a healthy release of patriotic emotions through support for one’s team, rather than through political strife.However, it is essential to acknowledge that some sporting events can be marred by tensions or violence among fans, which can undermine the potential for unity. That said, these instances are often the exception rather than the rule.In conclusion, while it is crucial to remain aware of the complexities surrounding national pride and international relations, I believe that events like the football World Cup predominantly offer a constructive outlet for easing tensions and fostering a sense of global solidarity. Through shared experiences and mutual respect, these occasions can indeed promote peace and understanding in an often fractured world.
37;Some people believe that the range of technology available to individuals today is increasing the gap between rich people and poor people, while others say that technology has the opposite effect. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Technology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.In the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one. Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies. Thus, most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people.Secondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.Undoubtedly, everything has two sides and technology is not an exception. To some extent, the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology, because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return. Nevertheless, I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap.In conclusion, the good technology bringing to us is undeniable. Under proper use of technology, the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it.;In today's world, technology permeates almost every aspect of our lives, and the debate surrounding its impact on socio-economic disparities is increasingly pertinent. Some argue that the proliferation of technology exacerbates the gap between the wealthy and the impoverished, while others contend that it democratizes opportunities and promotes equity.Proponents of the view that technology widens the wealth gap underscore that access to advanced technologies often remains a privilege of the affluent. For instance, individuals from wealthier backgrounds can afford high-quality education in technology, leading to lucrative careers in fields such as software development and data analysis. Additionally, expensive gadgets and fast internet connectivity are often beyond the reach of those in lower income brackets. This digital divide limits the ability of poorer individuals to compete in an economy that is progressively dependent on technological proficiency. Furthermore, the concentration of technological resources in urban areas can lead to a scenario where rural communities lag behind, enhancing regional inequalities.Conversely, those who argue that technology reduces the gap suggest that it provides various tools and platforms that foster economic mobility. The rise of the internet has enabled access to vast amounts of information and learning resources, allowing people from all backgrounds to improve their skills. For example, online education platforms can reach underserved populations, offering affordable or even free courses that equip them with necessary qualifications. Moreover, the gig economy facilitated by technology allows individuals to earn income regardless of their geographic location, potentially enhancing financial independence.In my opinion, while technology has the dual potential to either exacerbate or bridge the socio-economic divide, its true impact largely hinges on the policies and systems in place to ensure equitable access. To harness technology as a tool for inclusivity, it is crucial to invest in infrastructure and provide educational opportunities that empower everyone. Only through collective effort can we ensure that technological advancements benefit society as a whole and foster economic equality.
38;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;For many centuries, outer space has been one of the most favourable realms of study. Space expeditions have been launched and many have been successful. However, a lot of people still consider space exploration as an act of wasting money, to illustrate, astronauts only brought useless rocks back to planet earth despite the large sum of money spent on their equipment. On the other hand, there are some reasons for human beings to travel to outer space.Firstly, many facts about solar system can be discovered. For instance, a picture of planet earth proved that the earth is round, not flat. Another example is that it is the earth which goes around the sun, not vice versa. If it was not for the space exploration, we would never know these facts.Secondly, people can know more about the planet earth itself. By observing planet earth from outer space, people can find out ample things for example about the atmosphere of the planet earth. With this knowledge, people can work on something to prevent earth hazards such as global warming.Finally, a great deal of sophisticated technology can be invented. As astronauts need to travel to outer space which does not have any oxygen to breathe in, scientists are compelled to do research on the oxygen tanks. Oxygen tanks, for instance, are proved useful not only in outer space but also underwater. Moreover, spaceships, communication satellites and space pens also contribute a lot to the society.As a conclusion, I personally think that human beings should travel to outer space. In spite of costing a fortune, space exploration has given aforementioned benefits.;"The exploration of outer space has long captivated human imagination, leading many governments to allocate substantial financial resources to this endeavor. While critics argue that such expenditures divert funds from pressing terrestrial issues, I contend that investing in space exploration is a reasonable and necessary commitment that yields immense benefits across multiple dimensions.Firstly, space exploration drives technological innovation. Many technologies we take for granted today—such as satellite communications, GPS systems, and various materials used in engineering—were developed through space research initiatives. The benefits of these technologies extend beyond mere convenience; they enhance global communication, improve disaster management, and bolster various sectors including healthcare and agriculture. Investing in space thus supports not only scientific advancement, but catalyzes economic growth through the development of new industries and job creation.Secondly, the need for international collaboration in space exploration fosters peace and cooperation among nations. Programs such as the International Space Station (ISS) demonstrate how countries can work together towards a common goal, building relationships that may help defuse political tensions on Earth. By investing in joint missions and research, nations cultivate a spirit of collaboration that transcends borders, contributing to a more peaceful world.Finally, as Earth faces numerous challenges—such as climate change, resource depletion, and overpopulation—venturing into space presents potential solutions. Scientific research conducted in microgravity could inspire breakthroughs in energy generation or resource extraction, while long-term colonization projects may offer alternatives for humanity's survival. The pursuit of these ambitious objectives offers hope for a sustainable future.In conclusion, the investment made by governments in outer space exploration is not just reasonable; it is essential. It acts as a catalyst for technological progress, promotes international cooperation, and holds the potential to address existential challenges facing humanity. As we look to the stars, we must also recognize the profound benefits that lie on our home planet."
39;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In present day and age, students are normally exposed to extra jobs as early as they start their university. This phenomenon, although in some extents, are proved to have negative effects, I feel strongly that the disadvantages are far outweighed by the advantages. In this essay, some of the benefits surrounding this matter will be carefully explained.It is undoubtedly certain that students can gain their practical experience by getting involved extra jobs. Part-time jobs furnish them with precious chance to practice what they are learning at their universities. In addition, that seems to be more essential the present shortage of sufficiently practical conditions supplied in universities. As a result, students who get part time jobs have not only academic knowledge but also hands-on experience. Moreover, having experienced in working environment during student time offers a distinct advantage when they apply for jobs after their graduation.Secondly, students who take on a part time job are often more confident and independent than other ones. By constant communicating with other colleagues daily in a company environment where their new ideas can be raised without hesitation, then students' confidence could be significantly gained. Also, working conditions require students the independency in thinking, working, and solving problems, which is greatly helpful when the characteristic is applied to tackle subjects in their universities.Lastly, doing extra jobs helps student with money for their accommodation. Indeed, high studying tuition, added with raising accommodation expenses are becoming a huge burden to students. With the money they earn from extra jobs, which normally is not much, those difficulties could be partially solved. Moreover, that helps students from being reliant on their families as well as is a well-prepared condition for their independent later life.In conclusion, I feel certain that having a part time job during your student time will offer students many clear benefits. By taking on an extra job, students can partly alleviate some their problematic matters such as working experience, confidence and accommodation. It is my belief the tendency of getting extra jobs will increase more in the future.;The integration of part-time jobs into the lives of teenagers while they are still pursuing their studies has been a topic of extensive debate. In certain countries, this practice is prevalent and can offer both benefits and drawbacks. I believe that having jobs during their teenage years can be advantageous for students, mainly when managed correctly.One of the most significant benefits of teenagers working part-time jobs is the development of essential life skills. By balancing work and school, students learn time management, responsibility, and the importance of commitment. These skills are invaluable as they transition into adulthood, equipping them with the necessary tools to thrive in future employment scenarios. For instance, a teen who works in a retail environment will not only earn money but also gain customer service skills and learn how to handle different situations with professionalism.Moreover, part-time jobs can provide financial independence. Teens can earn and manage their own money, which offers them a sense of autonomy and responsibility. This experience can teach crucial financial literacy skills, such as budgeting, saving, and investing. Understanding the value of money at a young age can pave the way for more responsible financial habits in the future.However, it is vital to note that a balance must be struck. Excessive work hours can lead to stress and hinder academic performance. Students should not sacrifice their education for part-time employment. Therefore, it is essential for teenagers to pursue jobs that offer flexible hours and do not overwhelm them.In conclusion, while there are risks associated with teenagers working while attending school, the benefits, including the acquisition of vital life skills and financial independence, outweigh the drawbacks when jobs are managed appropriately. With proper guidance and a balanced approach, part-time employment can be a constructive experience for young individuals.
40;Some schools send their students to institutions/organizations for a short to do some unpaid work. To what extent is it beneficial to the students and the organizations/institutions?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss what can students and the organizations benefit from the activity that the students sent by their schools to work for companies without salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the advantages for doing this for both students and companies, and then I would draw a conclusion at the end.To begin with, students can learn invaluable experiences through the period of time working for the institutions they are assigned to. In most school curriculums, the courses are theoretical and often by instructors speaking to students sitting in the classroom. As a result, students might have little idea of the real challenges or the true situation when they enter the workforce after graduation. For this reason, the internship, although without pay, can give them the experiences that money cannot buy.As for the companies, the unpaid interns can no doubt save some money. In addition, the younger generations can help them generate new ideas as the students are not bound to restricted workload and they tend to have greater imagination, which can be essentially helpful when they are making a new advertisement or slogan. Moreover they can start looking for potential employees and begin the training. Therefore, companies save time and resources for searching new staffs and organizing an orientation.To sum up, students can learn outside the textbook and classroom with a real working experiences that can be a great opportunity for future job consideration whereas organizations earn much more as they can not only save time and money but also be enlightened by what young people have to say.;The practice of sending students to institutions or organizations for short-term unpaid work placements is increasingly becoming a component of modern educational curricula. This approach can yield significant benefits for both students and organizations, fostering practical experience and community engagement.For students, unpaid work placements offer invaluable opportunities to develop real-world skills that are often not addressed within traditional academic settings. Engaging in practical tasks helps students apply theoretical knowledge, thereby enhancing their understanding and retention of course material. Additionally, these experiences allow students to explore potential career paths, gain insight into the working environment, and develop soft skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. By interacting with professionals in their chosen fields, students can build networks that might be beneficial in their future job searches, offering them a competitive edge in the employment market.On the other hand, organizations and institutions also reap considerable rewards from welcoming students into their workforces. By providing mentorship and supervision, organizations can foster a sense of community engagement and corporate social responsibility. Students often bring fresh perspectives and innovative ideas that can contribute positively to the organization's projects and initiatives. Furthermore, they can help alleviate workloads for full-time staff, allowing existing employees to focus on more complex tasks while simultaneously enriching the workplace culture with their enthusiasm and eagerness to learn.However, it is essential for both students and organizations to realize that such placements should be structured and mutually beneficial. Ensuring that students receive adequate guidance and that organizations clearly define the scope of work can lead to more productive experiences. In conclusion, when implemented effectively, short-term unpaid work placements can be immensely beneficial, preparing students for their future careers while also enriching organizations with valuable contributions and innovative ideas.
41;Paying more money is the only possible motivation to make employees work harder and to increase their productivity. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The purpose of this essay is to discuss whether or not the only way to motivate employees to be more hard-working and productive is by raising their salaries. In this essay, I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this.A raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places. Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile. For instance, junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want. If the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan.Nevertheless, I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances. Take Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce. By doing this, the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured.To sum up, I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees. Alternatively, providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses.;The assertion that paying more money is the only possible motivation for employees to work harder and increase their productivity is a contentious one. While higher wages can undoubtedly act as a significant catalyst for enhanced work performance, it is overly simplistic to deem financial compensation as the sole motivator.Firstly, it is essential to recognize that intrinsic motivations play a crucial role in driving employee performance. Factors such as job satisfaction, personal growth, and a sense of accomplishment can significantly influence how hard individuals work. Employees often seek meaning in their roles, and when they find a connection between their work and their values or aspirations, their productivity can increase without any financial incentives. For instance, research has shown that employees who feel appreciated by their peers and employers tend to perform better, irrespective of their salary.Moreover, workplace culture and environment have a profound impact on motivation. A supportive atmosphere, marked by recognition of efforts, opportunities for collaboration, and effective leadership, can lead to high levels of employee engagement. Organizations that foster a sense of belonging and teamwork tend to inspire their employees to invest more effort into their work, indicating that the dynamics within a workplace can be as crucial as salary.In addition to intrinsic motivations and workplace culture, non-monetary incentives such as professional development opportunities, flexible working arrangements, and health benefits can also enhance employee productivity. Employees appreciate the opportunity to learn new skills, balance their work-life commitments, and feel secure in their roles, which can lead to higher performance levels.In conclusion, while increased financial compensation can motivate employees, it is not the only factor that drives hard work and productivity. A multifaceted approach that includes intrinsic motivation, workplace culture, and non-monetary incentives is essential for fostering a committed and productive workforce.
42;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. Do you agree or disagree?;For most folks on Earth, the need to gather in one place, and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation. This trend is so deeply engraved in people's mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned, even when some participants are facing grievous social problems. It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation. This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace, and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols.Firstly, during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event. For example, when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers. This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality. Thus, world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace.Secondly, these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country. For instance, when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field. South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night. This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team. As a result, it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events.In conclusion, after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries, it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness. This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future.;The assertion that popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions play a crucial role in easing international tensions and providing a safe outlet for patriotic emotions is certainly valid. These events serve as a unique platform where individuals and nations approach competition in a spirit of camaraderie and shared enjoyment, which can ultimately foster peace and understanding.Firstly, international sporting events bring together diverse populations, promoting cross-cultural interactions that can lead to improved diplomatic relationships. For example, during the World Cup, fans from various nations congregate, sharing in the celebration of sport. This exchange often transcends the political boundaries and animosities that may exist between countries. The universal language of sport allows for connection and mutual respect, encouraging a sense of unity rather than division. Moreover, these events provide an outlet for the often intense national pride that citizens feel. Sports act as a safe and regulated environment for expressing patriotism without the associated risks of conflict. Fans can rally behind their teams and celebrate their victories, which can boost national morale and create a sense of belonging among citizens, allowing them to focus on common identities rather than differences.However, it is crucial to address that international sporting events can also lead to heightened tensions, particularly when political agendas are involved or when there is a history of rivalry between nations. Instances of aggressive nationalism or hostility can mar the spirit of these occasions. Therefore, while these events have the potential to soothe international tensions and channel patriotic feelings positively, they can also evoke negative emotions if not managed appropriately.In conclusion, while international sporting occasions like the World Cup are not a panacea for global tensions, they undeniably provide a constructive outlet for patriotic fervor and foster a spirit of unity among people of diverse backgrounds. When embraced with the right attitude, they can promote peace, understanding, and shared joy on a global scale.
43;Government should make more effort to promote alternative sources of energy. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion.;The increasing population and the technological advancements demand more energy than in the past. It is believed that there are various other resources such as the nuclear and solar which are abundant and eco-friendly. I will analyze these areas in the essay.Firstly, the major source of energy today is water. Although there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source. To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short. Thus, during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India. If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity. Therefore, it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources.Secondly, the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming. For example, the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming. In the same way, the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution.To conclude, it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy. This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming. Further, government should motivate and encourage the people to use alternative sources such as the solar and the nuclear energy.;The debate surrounding energy sources is more pertinent than ever as countries grapple with the challenges of climate change, energy security, and sustainable development. I firmly agree that governments should make concerted efforts to promote alternative sources of energy, as the benefits extend beyond environmental protection to encompass economic stability and public health.Firstly, the environmental imperative for transitioning to alternative energy sources is compelling. Traditional fossil fuels are significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, which have detrimental effects on climate and public health. Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower, offer cleaner alternatives that substantially reduce carbon footprints. Promoting alternative energy aligns with global commitments, like the Paris Agreement, to limit global warming and mitigate climate-related disasters.Secondly, investing in alternative energy technologies fosters economic resilience. The renewable energy sector has shown remarkable growth, creating jobs in various fields, from manufacturing to installation and maintenance. Governments that prioritize the development of these industries not only stimulate job creation but also enhance energy independence, reducing reliance on imported fuels. This shift can result in more stable energy prices and local economic development.Moreover, promoting alternative energy contributes to public health improvements. Reduction in air pollution due to fossil fuel combustion can lead to fewer health-related issues, significantly lowering healthcare costs and improving quality of life. Clean energy sources can enhance energy access in underserved communities, providing them with reliable power while safeguarding their health.In conclusion, I strongly advocate that governments should intensify their efforts in promoting alternative sources of energy. The transition not only addresses urgent environmental challenges but also leads to economic and health benefits. Collective action towards cleaner energy is essential for a sustainable future, making it imperative for policymakers to prioritize this critical initiative.
44;The government should aid unemployed people by direct financial help. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Unemployment is clearly a global problem, be it in developed countries or developing ones. However, I tend to believe it is the responsibility of these disadvantaged citizens, rather than the government, to help them out.Government money should be spent on publicly beneficial programs only. Tax revenue is collected from those who works. Spending them on helping those not make contribution to society would not sound fair to tax payers. Besides, there are other pressing demands on the government expenditure, such as health care service and education, so addressing unemployment should have low priority.Also, it is obvious that, to survive in this competitive world, one has to work hard and equip themselves well. If they could get free financial help from the government, they might end up with out any motivation to work at all.Of course, this does not mean we should leave alone those who do need assistance. They are already in reverse circumstances and it would be rather difficult for them to overcome the difficulties without external support. In this case, the government ought to set up free vocational trainings or to provide interest-free bank loans for them, so that they can have the chance to get back to work. After all, it is beneficial to the society as a whole when the jobless can make contribution again.In conclusion, my point of view is that, although the government should provide help for the disadvantaged people, direct financial support may not be a wise option and people should rely on themselves to get out of the adversity.;The question of whether the government should provide direct financial aid to unemployed individuals is a pertinent topic in contemporary society. I firmly agree with the statement that direct financial support is essential for unemployed people. Firstly, unemployment can lead to significant financial distress, affecting individuals and families. When people lose their jobs, they often struggle to meet basic needs such as food, housing, and healthcare. Direct financial aid acts as a safety net, ensuring that these fundamental needs are met during periods of economic instability. Without this support, many individuals may be pushed further into poverty, leading to detrimental effects on their physical and mental health.Secondly, direct financial assistance can stimulate the economy. When unemployed people receive financial aid, they are more likely to spend that money on essential goods and services, which in turn bolsters local businesses. This increased consumer spending can help mitigate the negative effects of a recession and can even facilitate economic recovery. By supporting unemployed individuals, the government fosters a more resilient economy for everyone.Moreover, providing direct financial help can encourage individuals to seek new employment opportunities. Financial stability can allow unemployed individuals to invest in further education or training, thus improving their skills and increasing their employability. This proactive approach not only aids the individuals affected but also contributes to a more skilled workforce, benefiting the economy in the long run.In conclusion, I believe that the government should provide direct financial assistance to unemployed individuals. This support not only alleviates immediate financial burdens but also promotes economic stability and encourages personal development. In such uncertain times, it is crucial that we create systems that ensure every individual has the opportunity to regain their footing and contribute positively to society.
45;Some people think that universities should provide graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace. Others think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer. What, in your opinion, should be the main function of a university;Universities have quickly become the places to go when people seek to further develop their expertise. Whether this really suits the needs of their potential employers is highly unlikely as universities nowadays have evolved as a domain of experts: where more and more is known about less and less. Nevertheless, among the vast range of choices offered there are often some training courses that have direct implications on job-seeking and other aspects in everyday life. However, although I respect the universities' aim of providing such courses to develop skills required for work and support their cause, I do not believe it is the main or best function of a university.A university, in common sense, is a medium for conveying or providing access to knowledge. What is meant by this is that students are the ones universities should really cater for, not the employers, as students are the ones here to seek knowledge. High school graduates choose to further educate themselves in universities because of all different reasons: a degree that's more widely accepted, gain knowledge and insight into an industry, or simply deepen their research interests in a certain field.On the other hand, universities are regarded as institutions where abundant educational resources gather. It is, therefore, not necessary for a certain course or type of training to be offered to the students by a university, but instead, these must be made available when needed. So the truth lies somewhere closer to the fact that a university should provide access to information, rather than offer selected courses that are suitable for employers' taste.In conclusion, the main function of a university remains as the provision of knowledge and access to resources. It would be helpful, however, if certain courses concerning workplace skills can also be made available to students to help shape their futures.;"The debate surrounding the primary function of universities—whether to equip graduates with workplace-ready skills or to impart knowledge for its own sake—presents a multifaceted challenge. In my opinion, universities should aim to strike a balance between these two perspectives to fulfill their role effectively in an ever-changing world.On one hand, the argument for equipping students with practical skills is grounded in the current global job market, which increasingly favors candidates who can demonstrate relevant competencies. With rising tuition fees and burgeoning student debt, prospective students are keenly aware of the return on investment associated with their education. Universities that emphasize vocational training and skill development typically enhance their graduates' employability, aligning academic programs with industry demands. This pragmatic approach allows students to transition seamlessly from academia to the workforce, fostering economic growth and societal advancement.Conversely, the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake should not be marginalized. Education is not solely about preparing for a job; it is a transformative journey that encourages critical thinking, creativity, and intellectual exploration. Many fields, such as philosophy, history, and the arts, inherently promote these values, contributing to a well-rounded education. A curriculum that fosters a love for learning cultivates insightful citizens who contribute to society in diverse ways, from cultural enrichment to social innovation.Ideally, universities should provide a hybrid model that incorporates both aspects. By offering courses that impart practical skills while also nurturing intellectual curiosity, universities can produce graduates who are not only capable professionals but also informed, responsible citizens. This dual approach prepares students for the complexities of modern life, empowering them to adapt to the evolving demands of the workforce and engage meaningfully in wider societal conversations. Thus, the primary function of a university should be to weave together the practical and the philosophical, ensuring that education remains relevant and enriching."
46;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Preserving wild animals in zoos is an issue which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supporters maintaining that wild life would be taken good care from professionals, while opponents claim that the animals are deprived of freedom as a result of staying in zoos. From my perspective, animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.To begin with, it is the right of wild species to live in a environment away from human beings. Given the fact that human beings are responsible for the heavy pollution and severe damage to the natural habitats of many wild animals, it is our responsibility to create a natural and safe environment for animals to live in. Apparently, the limited space and the artificial trees and lakes can not fully compensate the animals for their loss. Moreover, if rural animals are captured in the zoo for a long period, it would have negative influences on both the physical and psychological status of the creatures. As a result, the wild species would suffer from isolation and depression. It seems that zoos are more likely to be a killer rather than a protector in protecting wild lives.Nevertheless, supporters would argue that zoos, which are equipped with modern facilities and professionals, would provide better care for the animals inside. They further point out that the endangered species preserved in zoos would never die of illegal hunting. However, I would contend that the strict laws prohibiting poaching would provide a shelter for various kinds of animals in natural habitat. It seems that the growing number of natural habitat would be the ultimate solution of saving wild animals worldwide.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that wild animals should be set free from zoos not only because they have the right to enjoy freedom but they also escape from isolation and depression.;The debate surrounding the relevance and utility of zoos is a complex one, eliciting strong opinions on both sides. I firmly disagree with the assertion that zoos have no useful purpose. Zoos play a vital role in education, conservation, and research, making them essential institutions in our society.Firstly, zoos serve as educational hubs for people of all ages. By providing close encounters with animals, they foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of wildlife. Educational programs and exhibits help visitors learn about animal behavior, habitats, and the challenges faced by various species. For example, children who visit a zoo are often inspired to develop a passion for wildlife conservation, which can lead to proactive efforts to protect endangered species in their natural environments.Secondly, zoos contribute significantly to conservation efforts. Many zoos participate in breeding programs for endangered species, thus ensuring the survival of species that might otherwise face extinction. The successful breeding of the Arabian oryx and the California condor in captivity illustrates how zoos can directly impact species recovery. They also engage in habitat preservation projects, often working in tandem with global conservation initiatives to protect wildlife and their ecosystems.Finally, zoos serve as research institutions, advancing our understanding of animal health, behavior, and ecology. Researchers can study animals' natural behaviors in a controlled environment, leading to breakthroughs in various fields, including veterinary medicine and ethology. This research not only benefits zoo animals but also enhances conservation strategies in the wild.In conclusion, while zoos are often critiqued for animal welfare concerns, their contributions to education, conservation, and research cannot be overlooked. Zoos play a crucial role in bridging the gap between humans and wildlife, promoting a more harmonious relationship with nature and fostering a future where both can thrive. Therefore, I strongly believe that zoos serve a meaningful purpose in today’s world.
47;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;A matter of considerable controversy at present is the issue of whether distance-learning should be promoted as much as possible, or rather attending lectures in person should be allowed to take a predominant place in universities because this way of learning is superior than online degrees. From my perspective, online-teaching should be widely used among colleges and universities in terms of convenience and optimizing cost for educational institutions.To begin with, distance-learning brings significant convenience for students in every corner of the world. In earlier times, students who were tired of commuting had to attend schools nearby, regardless of any differences in teaching facilities, teacher's qualifications or the school reputation. Now, however, students are able to apply for online-courses provided by top-of-the-range universities and colleges worldwide. Furthermore, the presence of video conferencing allows a teacher to teach a greater number of students. Consequently, educational institutions are able to optimize costs by increasing teacher-student ratios. Thanks to the economical online-teaching, universities and colleges are able to offer grants for students who have outstanding academic achievements but are unable to attend schools because of financial constrains.Nevertheless, opponents of online-degrees would argue that attending lectures in person provides students an opportunity to communicate with teachers and other classmates. They further point out that traditional teaching approaches involving discussion and cooperation among students play a significant role in campus life. It is the real interactions and communications in class make education much more attractive.By way of conclusion, it is my belief that distance-learning will become increasingly important in the future as the pace of life increases. However, discussions and interactions should be held via video conferencing frequently so that the joy of learning would not be diminished.;In recent years, distance-learning programs have gained immense popularity, providing flexibility and accessibility to learners worldwide. However, the debate about their efficacy compared to traditional in-person education continues to be a contentious issue. While I recognize the merits of both approaches, I tend to agree that distance-learning programs can be as effective as traditional ones, though they come with distinct challenges.Firstly, distance-learning offers unparalleled flexibility that appeals to diverse learners. Individuals with work, family commitments, or geographical constraints can pursue their education without the need for a rigid schedule. Online courses often allow students to learn at their own pace, enabling them to balance multiple responsibilities while still achieving their academic goals. This accessibility can lead to increased enrollment and participation from individuals who might otherwise be excluded from the traditional education system.However, it is crucial to address the limitations of distance-learning, particularly regarding the interpersonal aspects of education. Traditional classrooms foster face-to-face interaction, which can enhance communication skills, foster collaborative learning, and form deep connections among peers and instructors. The socialization that occurs in a physical setting can be vital for personal development and networking opportunities, which may be less prevalent in an online environment.Furthermore, distance learning requires a high level of personal discipline and motivation. Without the structured environment of a classroom, students may struggle with time management and self-directed learning. Some individuals thrive in a traditional setting where they can receive immediate feedback and support from their instructors.In conclusion, while distance-learning programs have transformed the educational landscape, making it more accessible and flexible, they also present challenges that may affect the learning experience. I believe that the effectiveness of either approach largely depends on the individual learner’s personality, goals, and circumstances. Therefore, rather than viewing one method as superior, it is essential to recognize the strengths and limitations inherent in both.
48;Some people have benefited from modern communication technology, but some people have not benefited from it at all. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Modern communication technologies such as mobile phones, e-mails and internet chat programs like the MSN Messenger have brought significant changes to our lives in recent years. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the overall effect of this innovation has been positive or negative. Although there are valid arguments to the contrary, it is my belief that the majority of people in the globe have benefited greatly from these powerful and effective means of modern communication.To begin with, mobile phones and other tools of modern communication facilitate not only contact with friends and relatives in faraway places but also global business. With the click of a button, the vast amount of information can be transmitted from America to China in just a few seconds. Furthermore, it is generally felt that the access to these tools of communication is available in every corner of the world. With a mobile phone or a laptop, a person can talk or send messages online at a bus stop, in a corner shop or anywhere they could imagine. Therefore, it seems that these new forms of communication do bring a great deal of convenience to humankind.Nevertheless, opponents of modern communications claim that only the more privileged are able to enjoy the benefits. They further point out that the wide spread use of these efficient and effective ways of communication costs a considerable amount of money. Anyone who aims to use these innovations have to not only pay for the appliances such as a mobile phone or a computer but also cover up costs for communication services. Consequently, people who live in poverty are less likely to be benefited from modern communication technologies.By way of conclusion, I believe that modern communication technologies will benefit more people in the future as the pace of life increases; however, the have-nots cannot be ignored simply because they couldn't afford it.";The advent of modern communication technology has revolutionized the way we interact, access information, and conduct business. However, the benefits of these advancements are not uniformly experienced. I agree that while many individuals and sectors have reaped considerable benefits from these technologies, a significant portion of the population remains disadvantaged.On one hand, modern communication technologies, such as smartphones, social media, and video conferencing tools, have greatly enhanced connectivity and efficiency. For businesses, these tools have facilitated global interactions, enabling companies to reach wider markets and collaborate across borders with ease. For individuals, the ability to connect instantly with friends and family—regardless of geographical distance—has transformed social dynamics and fostered a sense of community among even the most dispersed populations. Moreover, access to a wealth of information online has empowered individuals to learn and develop skills at an unprecedented rate, bridging educational gaps that previously existed.Conversely, there are numerous groups and individuals who have not benefited from these advancements. In many developing regions, limited access to reliable internet and devices makes it difficult for individuals to leverage modern communication technologies effectively. This digital divide exacerbates existing inequalities, where those already disadvantaged in terms of education and economic opportunities are further marginalized. Additionally, older generations may struggle to adapt to rapidly changing technologies, leading to social isolation rather than enhanced connectivity. Furthermore, the pervasive nature of these technologies can also lead to negative consequences, such as cyberbullying, misinformation, and a general decline in face-to-face interactions.In conclusion, while modern communication technologies have undoubtedly transformed lives for many, it is essential to acknowledge that their benefits are not universally experienced. Efforts should be made to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to harness the power of these tools, thereby fostering a more inclusive digital landscape.
49;Some people argue that musical lessons should be made mendatory in high school sducation while others argue that it's a wast of time for students. What is your opinion?;Most people claim that in high school music must be taught as a main subject, while others say that this is an unnecessary subject and should at least be optional. In this essay I will give my opinion for both sides.It is obvious that music has a great power which can positively influence on human being and its psychology. Therefore, many university authorities provide music lessons for their students so that they live and study in a harmony with music. I have an impression that students, who spend a great deal of their time studying different academic subjects should have an opportunity to cope with the stress gained during school time. In this case, music can be a useful and interesting solution. Moreover, if musical activity involves many participants, there will be co-operation and developed team work in the group, which is, of course, beneficial in their future life. In fact, students with a quite poor academic background can show themselves in the music. Consequently, the calm atmosphere in the class might be created.By contrast, it is clear that music can have many mentally enhancing effects on students. In our hectic life, however, demand is not for musically orientated students, but for academically developed employees. Hence, I agree with the majority, because music is the art which requires special attitude towards it. Increasingly however, students can not obtain supposed impacts, unless they get interested in it more seriously. Therefore, music and other entertaining subjects should be optional. Nowadays, time is the most valuable thing in life with increased pace. To my mind, students are to develop their professional skills by learning occupation-related subjects, rather than playing on guitar or singing a song.In conclusion, I think that in order to be a competitive worker, students must know their field in an advanced level. On the other hand, music can help an individual to shape its character. An integration of music into learning process bound to be successful when it is not compulsory.;"The debate surrounding the necessity of mandatory musical lessons in high school education raises compelling arguments on both sides. While opponents may consider these lessons a waste of valuable academic time, I contend that incorporating music into the curriculum is critical for holistic student development and should be deemed essential.First and foremost, engaging in musical education fosters creativity and self-expression among students. In a world increasingly dominated by science and technology, nurturing artistic abilities becomes paramount. Music lessons provide students with an outlet to explore their emotions and thoughts, cultivating confidence and promoting a strong sense of identity. These experiences ultimately contribute to better mental health, equipping students with coping mechanisms essential for the challenges of adolescence.Moreover, learning an instrument or engaging in musical theory has been shown to enhance cognitive skills. Research indicates that students involved in music education tend to perform better academically, particularly in subjects such as mathematics and language arts. Music requires discipline, focus, and practice, qualities that are transferable to other areas of study. By embedding musical lessons within the curriculum, schools not only enrich the students’ artistic capabilities but also bolster their overall academic performance.In addition, music education encourages teamwork and collaboration. Group performances and ensemble practices teach students the importance of working together toward a common goal. Such cooperative experiences are invaluable, as they mirror real-world scenarios, preparing students for future professional environments where collaboration is often paramount.In conclusion, while critics may view musical lessons as superfluous, the multifaceted benefits they offer to students far outweigh any perceived drawbacks. Making music education mandatory in high schools is not merely about learning notes and rhythms; it is about enhancing creativity, cognitive skills, and social collaboration. As we shape future generations, we must recognize the significance of a well-rounded education that embraces the arts."
50;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Universities should give the same amount of money to their students' sport activities as they give to their university libraries.;Libraries and sports activities play important roles in universities success. Most university rankings pay attention to quality of these two activities. In my opinion universities should invest in libraries more than anywhere else.First, I think a library is vital and strategical part of a university. All professors and students need to have a modern and well-equipped library because, after internet, library plays an important role in research. Although sport is important, it does not have the same priority of library has. In addition only small part of students attend sport activities. For example, in my university number of students who use the library is much more than students do sports activities.Second, usually libraries do not have income. Most libraries are free not for students also for public. Hence, universities support is vital for libraries. But sport activities have a good income because every sport has different matches and for each match they have a lot sponsors. Also, they have this chance to sell their important matches tickets. To conclude, there are good ways for sports activities to compensate their expenses, but it is very hard for libraries to find a good way for have an income.Last but not least, investing in libraries has a long-time result. For example, a library can buy a lot of new books or they can buy more computers. Most of the library facilities are stable and you can use them for a long time. Besides, in the far future, they become more valuable. On the other side, most sports facilities except buildings are usually can be used in short-time and they are not persistent for a long-time.In spite of the importance of sports activities, libraries are more important. They are critical part of universities and a good university has to have a modern library.;Universities play a critical role in shaping not only the academic but also the social and physical development of their students. The allocation of funds between sports activities and libraries is a topic of ongoing debate. I believe that universities should allocate equal funding to both areas, as each serves a distinct yet vital purpose in student life.Firstly, libraries are conventional bastions of knowledge, providing students with access to a wealth of resources necessary for their academic success. They support research, promote critical thinking, and foster an environment of learning. Increased funding for libraries ensures that students can utilize the latest academic materials, technology, and safe study spaces. However, it is essential to recognize that academic success is not solely determined by intellectual pursuits.On the other hand, sports activities contribute significantly to the physical and mental well-being of students. Participation in sports teaches valuable life skills such as teamwork, leadership, and time management. Moreover, physical activity is crucial for maintaining mental health, especially during periods of academic stress. By investing in sports programs, universities can promote a balanced lifestyle, encouraging students to prioritize their health alongside their studies.Funding sports programs equally acknowledges the holistic development of students. When universities invest in both libraries and sports, they send a clear message that they value the diverse needs of their student body. This approach creates well-rounded individuals who are not only academically competent but also physically fit and socially engaged.In conclusion, equal funding for students' sports activities and university libraries is essential for fostering a balanced educational environment. Each element supports different facets of student life, and a harmonious allocation of resources can enhance both academic performance and personal development, ultimately preparing students for successful futures.
51;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;"With the development of globalization, English became the dominated language in national trade, conference and many important events. This phenomenon has aroused a heated discussion in public.Some people claim that the prevalent of English brings a great number of benefits for people. First of all, it promotes the communication and interaction between different countries more conveniently and clearly. In the ancient time, the different languages and geography set barriers for people to exchange their goods and ideas. Fortunately, the innovation of plane and train solved the geographical barriers. If we can popularize the use of English, the language hinder will disappear as well. In addition, English is a beautiful language, which is more systematical and extensive than many other languages. Learning English can foster people's sentiment and nourish their literature and art.However, the opponents believe that the dominated status of English has destroyed culture diversity and many less-used languages become extinct. Even English is a sophisticated language; it does not express every detail of life especially in Asia countries, which have totally different linguistic system. It is undeniable that language contains many aspects of people's daily life, which is influenced by culture, environment as well as religious. Obviously, these languages have special significance for people who belong to them and using English to replace them is crudity.Personally, English as an elegant language should be advocated in many fields to expand the global trade and communications. But, we still need preserve other languages for sake of keeping the linguistic and cultural diversity.";The rise of English as a global lingua franca has transformed communication, commerce, and culture across the world. However, this dominance comes at a considerable cost: the gradual extinction of many lesser-known languages. While there are undeniable advantages to the widespread use of English, the disadvantages, particularly the loss of linguistic diversity, are significant and cannot be overlooked.On one hand, the proliferation of English facilitates global communication and access to information. It serves as a common ground for people from diverse backgrounds, fostering international cooperation and trade. Moreover, English is often perceived as the language of opportunity, enabling individuals to enhance their education and career prospects in a globalized world. For instance, fluency in English is a requirement for many jobs in multinational companies and is essential for academic pursuits in reputable institutions.However, this dominance poses a grave threat to the world's linguistic heritage. Many languages are at risk of disappearing as younger generations gravitate towards English for social and economic reasons. When a language dies, an entire culture, including its history, traditions, and worldviews, fades into obscurity. The loss of linguistic diversity impoverishes our collective human experience, as each language carries unique expressions of identity and understanding that cannot be effortlessly transferred to another tongue.Furthermore, the marginalization of lesser-known languages creates a power imbalance, wherein native speakers may feel pressured to abandon their linguistic heritage in favor of a dominant language. This shift not only affects individual identities but also erodes community bonds and cultural continuity.In conclusion, while the convenience and opportunities provided by the global prevalence of English are significant, the disadvantages—particularly the loss of linguistic diversity and cultural richness—are profound. It is crucial to strike a balance that allows for both the use of English as a global language and the preservation of lesser-known languages, thereby ensuring that the world remains a tapestry of vibrant cultures and histories.
52;Some people believe that humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit, while others argue that the rights of animals should be protected.;Man has dominated all his fellow beings on earth because of his superior brain. He has domesticated a large number of animals and birds and makes use of them to make life easier and convenient for himself. Many people encourage the use of animals for their personal needs, while others are concerned that animals should not be misused. This essay will discuss some arguments for and against animal domestication.Human being has driven many animals for their personal use such as, cows and other milch animals for yielding milk from them. Likewise, other animals such as, horses, cattles and donkeys for farming, agriculture and as a mode of transportation. Many people keep pets like dogs and cats, trained them as service dogs and snuffing dogs which are very helpful to police force and even to some blind peoples. They are kept for security purposes in houses.On the other hand, many farmers and owners exploit animals beyond their limits. For instance, cows are often injected by Oxytocin, a hormone which is used to forcibly increase lactation. This in turn, causes lots of discomfort and pain to the cattle. Furthermore, thousand of animals undergo painful suffering or death as a result of scientific research of drugs and various products. Another example of this is cage farming which is against animal rights. Many other practices like, equestrian sport where horses run miles and miles and beaten up by jockeys to make them run more faster. And above all pleasure hunting of defenseless animals.From my prospective, human being should behave as a guardian to animals rather than as their lord or masters. Animal rights are meant to set limits on human behavior and manipulation of them should be punished as a serious crime.;The age-old debate regarding the treatment of animals often splits opinions between those who advocate for human benefit from animal use and those who champion the rights of animals. On one hand, supporters of utilizing animals for human advantage contend that animals have historically been integral to human survival and progress. From providing food, clothing, and labor to serving as companions and support animals, the relationship between humans and animals has always been symbiotic. They argue that humans are at the top of the food chain, and leveraging animals for various needs, whether through agriculture, research, or companionship, is a natural and necessary part of life. Conversely, advocates for animal rights emphasize the ethical implications of using animals purely for human gain. They argue that animals are sentient beings capable of experiencing pain and joy, and as such, they deserve protection from exploitation and harm. Many of the practices associated with animal agriculture—such as factory farming, animal testing, and entertainment—are often criticized for their inhumane treatment of animals. Ethical considerations point to the need for compassion and respect for all forms of life, suggesting that humans must develop alternative methods that do not involve the suffering or sacrifice of animals.The crux of this debate lies in balancing utilitarian needs with moral obligations. While some animal use can be justified for human benefit—such as service animals providing support to those in need—the methods employed must be humane and ethical. It is crucial to pioneer practices that prioritize animal welfare, ensuring their rights are acknowledged and respected. In conclusion, the challenge is to strike a balance between benefiting from animals and upholding their dignity, leading to a coexistence that enriches both humans and the animal kingdom.
53;Modern technology has made it possible for people to view exhibitions at home so museums and art galleries will disappear soon. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"It is quite common that more and more people can watch exhibitions through television or internet at home due to modern technology; therefore, some people think museums and art galleries will disappear soon. Although modern technology make it possible, I still believe some museums and art galleries will not disappear.On the one hand, technology indeed simplifies people's life all the time. Obviously, people who watch exhibitions on TV or internet at home, save the time and money on the road, which is increasingly significant particularly to people in modern society. However, in accordance with recent research, experts suggest the lifestyle of individuals in modern society is unhealthy because they lack of physical exercise and face-to-face communication.On the other hand, the importance of museums and art galleries is plain in terms of education and culture. First of all, authentic exhibits cannot be completely displayed only by images and videos. It is like travelling to a place is much better than viewing the landscape of that place on TV or photos, so the best method to learn one thing is to experience it. Furthermore, museums and art galleries preserve some culture heritages; therefore, these buildings will not disappear unless people abandon their culture.In conclusion, I admit that modern technology has provided a more convenient and comfortable manner for people to watch exhibitions, but museums and art galleries are necessary to be preserved for its importance of education and culture.";"The advent of modern technology has indeed transformed the way we experience art and culture, making it possible for individuals to view exhibitions from the comfort of their homes. While this shift has raised concerns about the future of traditional museums and art galleries, I argue that these institutions are unlikely to disappear; rather, they will adapt and evolve alongside technological advancements.Firstly, the immersive experience offered by physical spaces cannot be easily replicated. When visiting a museum or gallery, one can engage with the artwork on a sensory level that digital platforms cannot match. The scale, texture, and nuances of physical artwork resonate differently in person, fostering a deeper emotional connection. Furthermore, the atmosphere of a museum—encompassing the architecture, lighting, and quiet reverence—contributes significantly to the art appreciation experience. This unique environment cannot be replicated through screens or virtual reality.Secondly, museums and galleries serve as communal spaces that encourage social interaction and discourse. They bring together diverse groups of people who share a common interest in art and culture, fostering a sense of community. The experience of discussing a piece of art, attending events, or participating in workshops creates a dynamic that is inherently absent in virtual experiences. This social aspect is critical, particularly in an increasingly digital world that can often feel isolating.Moreover, many museums have embraced technology as a tool for enhancing the visitor experience rather than as a replacement. Innovations such as virtual reality tours and online gallery access are complementary, allowing institutions to reach a broader audience and engage with visitors who may not have the opportunity to visit in person.In conclusion, while modern technology has indeed changed how we engage with art and exhibitions, it does not herald the imminent disappearance of museums and galleries. Instead, these institutions will likely continue to thrive by integrating technological advancements that enhance, rather than replace, the irreplaceable experience of viewing art in person."
54;Some people believe that teenagers should learn all school subjects, while others claim that students should focus on the subjects that they are best at or that they are interested in. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Presently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.The benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.Those who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected. Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study. Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.It is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future. Therefore, I do support the view of learning all school subjects.;The debate over whether teenagers should learn a broad array of school subjects or concentrate solely on those they excel in or enjoy is a contentious one with valid arguments on both sides.Proponents of a well-rounded education argue that exposure to a wide range of subjects is crucial for developing versatile skills. Learning various disciplines such as mathematics, literature, science, and the arts allows students to foster critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving abilities. This diverse knowledge base can prepare them for an unpredictable future where adaptability is key. Furthermore, studying a range of subjects can help students discover hidden talents and interests that they may not have otherwise explored. A strong foundation across multiple areas can also enhance collaborative skills, as students engage with peers from different academic backgrounds.On the other hand, those in favor of specialization contend that focusing on subjects where students excel or exhibit a passion leads to a more engaged and motivated learner. Tailoring education to individual strengths can result in deeper understanding and mastery of specific areas, potentially leading to greater achievements and satisfaction in those fields. Critics of the traditional educational model argue that a one-size-fits-all approach can stifle creativity and discourage students who struggle in non-preferred subjects. By allowing students to concentrate on their interests, educators can nurture a more enthusiastic and driven generation.In my opinion, a balanced approach that incorporates elements of both viewpoints is ideal. While it is essential for students to have a well-rounded education, offering them the choice to delve deeper into subjects that ignite their passion can enhance their learning experience. Educational systems should promote interdisciplinary studies while also allowing for personalized learning paths, thus equipping students with both breadth and depth in their academic pursuits. This strategy can cultivate a generation of learners who are not only knowledgeable but also deeply invested in their education.
55;English is making many lesser-known languages die out each year. To what extent do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;In the present age, it is a matter of fact that increasing minority languages have diminished from the world due to the proliferation of English. Some people claim it's a reasonable loss in globalization while others argue the demerits exceed the merits. Personally, I agree with the former opinion.No one can deny the huge benefits of the trend that English is being accepted universally. To begin with, communication between countries and cultures become convenient. In my country, English is a required course from elementary school. Thus, studying abroad is easy and becomes hot among youngsters. For them, language obstacle is no longer a problem, which results in mutual understanding and trust between their mother land and the host country. This, in turn, enhances relationship and promotes international business. Furthermore, researchers, especially those who work on high-tech, would have wider range of references if they are good at English. Taking IT industry for an example, top technical science is published in English. It's neither to get a translated version of these articles, nor to always have a translator besides. As a result, they have no choice but choosing English as a second language.Admittedly, opponents may blame that English is making lesser-known languages disappear ever year. Hence, the culture heritage and nation identity vanish. However, this is really short-sighted, ignoring the rapid development of native economy and society.In conclusion, in spite of some negative effects, I'm totally convinced that the prevalent usage of English brings benefits to people and countries all around. I suggest all youths should learn English owing to its key role in globalization. But at the same time, actions, like recording, can be taken to protect native languages and cultures.;"The spread of English as a global lingua franca has undoubtedly facilitated communication and economic opportunities across diverse cultures. However, this phenomenon carries significant ramifications for lesser-known languages, many of which are disappearing at an alarming rate. The debate surrounding whether the advantages of English's dominance outweigh its disadvantages is complex and multifaceted.On one hand, the advantages of a common language like English are clear. It fosters international dialogue, enhances business prospects, and promotes access to knowledge and technology. In an increasingly interconnected world, English serves as a bridge, enabling individuals from diverse backgrounds to collaborate and innovate. For instance, international scientific communities often publish research findings in English, ensuring wider dissemination and impact. This facilitates not only academic progress but also socio-economic growth in nations engaged in the global market.Conversely, the decline of lesser-known languages is a profound loss, not only for the speakers of those languages but for humanity as a whole. Each language embodies unique cultural identities, histories, and worldviews. As these languages fade, so too do the traditions, knowledge systems, and perspectives they carry. The extinction of a language can be likened to the loss of a biodiversity-rich ecosystem; it diminishes our collective cultural heritage and reduces the richness of human expression. Furthermore, linguistic diversity is crucial for fostering creativity and innovation; diverse languages offer varied ways of thinking that can inspire new approaches to problems.In conclusion, while the advantages of English as a global language offer undeniable benefits in terms of communication and economic opportunity, the disadvantages—principally the erosion of cultural diversity and the loss of unique identities—are substantial. To promote linguistic diversity, efforts must be made to encourage bilingualism and preserve less prevalent languages. Ultimately, the preservation of world languages should be prioritized alongside the benefits presented by the widespread use of English."
56;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, pictures, music or film) in whichever way they wish. there should be no government restrictions on what they do. to what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Creativity is the ability to think beyond the obvious. Many governments restrict the artistic works of the creative minds. Creativity originates in a free mind. Hence, creative artists must be given the freedom to express their ideas without any restrictions.Time and again, creative artists like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, Shakespeare etc. have made artistic works which gave a social message. Right from sculptures to paintings, books to drama and movies, all these artistic works have reflected the contemporary social issues of different eras. Creative works help to create social awareness by giving a social message.Nonetheless, innovative works makes people realize things in a peaceful way and peep into their own conscience. It helps to raise issues and criticize the wrong doings of the governments. For instance, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin was accused of acting against the government, just because she raised a social issue. This type of approach is a hurdle in promoting creative minds. In addition, creativity also gives aesthetic charm.Unfortunately, many governments restrict the artists. Frank Zappa once said, ""Mind is like a parachute, it doesn't work if its not open“. Restrictions would just curb the innovative ideas of the artists and would limit their brains. Like the media, artists should also be given the freedom to express their ideas freely.However, artists should also know not to hurt the sentiments of the people. Many artists have been involved in controversies because of hurting the religious or social beliefs of the common people. Artists should have self-awareness not to create vulgar, hurtful or useless works which do not serve any purpose. I firmly believe that artists should be given the freedom of expression. Mind can not work when it is chained in boundaries. Imagination is at its best when the mind is relaxed and free from the fear of government or any restrictive laws.";The creative freedom of artists is a cornerstone of cultural expression and innovation. The premise that artists should be unrestricted in their expression — through words, images, music, or film — invites examination of both the benefits and potential drawbacks of such freedom. I strongly agree that creative artists should have the liberty to express their ideas without government restrictions, as this fosters artistic innovation, diversity of thought, and social progress.First, unrestricted artistic expression catalyzes innovation. When artists are free to explore unconventional ideas, they often push boundaries that inspire new forms and genres. For instance, the emergence of avant-garde art movements and experimental music has contributed significantly to the evolution of the arts. Societies thrive when diverse creative voices mingle, as they can challenge norms and provoke fresh perspectives. Such a dynamic environment fosters creativity that might otherwise be stifled under a more restrictive regime.Moreover, creative expression is essential for reflecting societal issues and advocating for change. Artists have historically played a pivotal role in highlighting injustices and galvanizing public opinion—consider the powerful protest songs during civil rights movements or films that expose societal flaws. If artists face governmental constraints, vital conversations that could lead to societal improvements might be silenced, depriving communities of valuable insights and critiques.However, it is also important to acknowledge the potential for abuse of this freedom. Artists might propagate harmful ideologies or offend specific demographics. Nonetheless, rather than imposing restrictions, a more constructive approach could involve fostering critical discourse and education about the impact of art on society.In conclusion, while there may be concerns regarding the content of artistic expression, the benefits of granting creative artists unrestricted freedom far outweigh the risks. An environment of free expression enhances cultural richness and encourages open dialogue about critical societal issues, ultimately promoting a more vibrant and dynamic society.
57;some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;The modern society is full of cut-throat competition. Some people think that inculcating co-operative approach in a child is essential while some think that competing is the best way to succeed. However, co-operative approach always helps a child to become a responsible adult with good moral values and a friendly social circle.Co-operation is essential for teamwork. Educational systems emphasize on encouraging co-operative approach in children. We live in a social setup and mutual help and sharing only leads to success. A person can not learn or achieve everything by oneself. For instance, lions hunt in a team. It is only due to their teamwork that they are able to catch a prey and make task easy. In the same way, co-operative approach will save time, energy and will have a higher success rate.Nevertheless, co-operation helps to understand other's perspective and learn by their mistakes. It helps to identify one's strengths and weaknesses as compared to others. A co-operative approach can create inspirational and motivational feeling seeing other people's achievements. However, competition is also as important as co-operation.Unfortunately, the meaning of competiton has been modified in a wrong direction. An individual must compete with oneself only, instead of trying to beat others. Competition has helped the development of science and technology. Competition helps in improvement and evolution. For example, every other day, new cars are developed by companies which are more efficient than others. This kind of competition gives customers more options.However, blind and selfish competition is detrimental. 'Your loss, my gain' kind of competition can never be fruitful in the long run. Competition should be always based on self-improvement rule. A healthy competition which involves raising one's own level above others is the best approach.Thus, competition and co-operation go hand in hand. These are two sides of the same coin which can't be separated. I firmly believe that children should be taught co-operation complimented with a healthy competition. They must be made aware of the demerits of selfish competition. When co-operation and healthy competition is followed together, success, achievements, recognition and any goal becomes easier.;The debate surrounding whether competition or cooperation is more beneficial for children’s development has been a long-standing one. Proponents of competition argue that it fosters a sense of determination and resilience. Being challenged and striving to excel can prepare children for the realities of adult life, where competition is prevalent in job markets and various aspects of social life. Supporters believe that instilling a competitive spirit encourages children to set personal goals, work hard, and develop healthy self-esteem through achievement.On the other hand, opponents of competition highlight the importance of cooperation in nurturing strong interpersonal skills. They argue that collaboration teaches children to communicate effectively, solve problems collectively, and appreciate diverse perspectives. In an increasingly interconnected world, these attributes are crucial for success in both personal and professional relationships. Furthermore, cooperation can instill values of empathy and mutual support, promoting social harmony and the ability to work as part of a team, an essential skill in most careers today.In my opinion, a balanced approach is key to children's development. While healthy competition can motivate children and enhance individual skills, it should not overshadow the importance of cooperation. Encouraging activities that promote both competitive spirit and teamwork can lead to well-rounded individuals. Schools and parents should provide environments where children can experience the thrill of competition, coupled with opportunities to collaborate on projects and social activities.In conclusion, both competition and cooperation possess their virtues. The essential task is to integrate these elements effectively in a child’s upbringing, allowing them to develop resilience and self-discipline through competition, while simultaneously learning the value of teamwork, empathy, and collaboration. This holistic approach likely results in children who are not only driven but also capable of contributing positively to society.
58;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violent increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Crime is always punishable. Retribution is the method for countering criminals. Some countries have stringent rules, like capital punishment, while other have a lot of flexibility in the judicial system. However, strict laws, like capital punishment, are essential in a society.Capital punishment is given only in the ""rarest of the rare"" cases. Its first and foremost objective is safety of other human beings. When a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment. Thus, capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals.Moreover, capital punishment curbs the inspiration and prospects of other hateful crimes. When a criminal mind knows the quantum of punishment, they will fear and not commit such crimes. Thus, the rate of crime and violence is effectively decreased.Importantly, capital punishment saves a lot of government funding which is wasted in maintenance of these hardcore criminals. Criminals who don't have any chance of improvement or who have a past record of such crimes are, therefore, given capital punishment.However, the jury giving the verdict are also humans. They have the life of a person at their discretion. They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. For example, if an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous. Only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment.Capital punishment is essential to control violence in the society. I firmly believe that psychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment. Capital punishment helps to safeguard human rights in a strict and effective manner. However, it should be considered as the last option by the jury and all circumstances must be taken into account before pronouncing the final verdict.";The debate surrounding capital punishment, often referred to as the death penalty, is complex and multifaceted. Proponents argue that it serves as a deterrent to violent crime, while opponents raise ethical concerns regarding its application. While some may contend that abolishing the death penalty leads to increased insecurity and violent crimes, I contend that the relationship is not as straightforward and that there are more effective means to enhance public safety.Advocates for capital punishment assert that the fear of execution prevents potential criminals from engaging in violent behaviors. They argue that certainty in severe punishment could dissuade individuals from committing heinous acts such as murder, thereby contributing to a more secure society. However, empirical evidence on the deterrent effect of the death penalty is mixed. Several studies demonstrate that regions without capital punishment do not necessarily experience higher rates of violent crime compared to those with it. In fact, factors such as socio-economic conditions, access to education, effective law enforcement, and community engagement play a more vital role in influencing crime rates.Furthermore, the ethical implications of capital punishment cannot be overlooked. The irreversible nature of the death penalty raises concerns about wrongful convictions, potential biases in its application, and the moral ramifications of state-sanctioned killing. Moreover, capital punishment does not address the root causes of violence, such as poverty, mental health issues, and substance abuse, which, if prioritized, could lead to a more profound reduction in crime.In conclusion, while some may believe that capital punishment is essential for maintaining social order, I argue that it is not the most effective means of preventing violent crime. Instead, enhancing the justice system, focusing on rehabilitation, and addressing the underlying social issues are more reliable paths towards a safer society.
59;In some countries, young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Studies are an essential part of life. Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies, while in some countries, it is considered as waste of time. However, a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school.In most education systems, a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age. A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change. A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions. Personally, a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by traveling or following their hobbies. Importantly, when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge.Nevertheless, during high school, many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in. Working or traveling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest. It will also help them to learn professional setup by working. Financially, students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job. Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course.However, there are also disadvantages. A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental. When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia. For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably. Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time. But, the break should be an optional thing. It varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period. A break gives students more benefits than harms.Importantly, the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them. Thus, a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies. Countries, like India, where such a break is considered a blot, should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition. One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life.;In recent years, the trend of young people taking a gap year—be it through work or travel—between the completion of high school and the commencement of university studies has gained considerable popularity in various countries. This decision carries both a multitude of advantages and a few potential disadvantages that merit careful consideration.One of the primary advantages of taking a gap year is the opportunity for personal growth. Young adults often emerge from high school with a limited understanding of the world and little practical experience. Traveling or working provides them with exposure to diverse cultures, ideas, and perspectives, fostering independence and enhancing life skills such as communication, problem-solving, and adaptability. These experiences can significantly contribute to personal development and maturity, enabling students to approach their university studies with a more informed mindset.Moreover, engaging in work during a gap year can also provide financial benefits. Many young individuals can earn money to offset the costs of higher education, alleviating some of the burden student loans may impose. This practical aspect encourages responsibility and prepares them for financial independence in adulthood.However, while the advantages are compelling, there are notable disadvantages to consider. One significant concern is the potential loss of academic momentum. After a year away from formal education, some students may struggle to transition back into the rigorous demands of university courses. Familiarity with academic habits can wane, making it challenging for them to reintegrate into scholarly routines.Additionally, not all young people have the means or opportunities to travel or work effectively during a gap year. Economic factors can limit options, leading to disparities between students and possibly reinforcing social inequalities. In conclusion, while taking a gap year presents opportunities for growth, exploration, and financial gain, it also carries risks related to academic continuity and accessibility. Ultimately, the decision should be made after careful reflection on individual goals, circumstances, and readiness for such an experience.
60;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;"Computer-a device which has given a whole new dimension to the human life. Ever since Charles Babbage (know as ""Father of computers"") invented computers, its development never had a pause. The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years.In the modern world, computers are used everywhere. Right from flying planes to sending a small document, computers are needed. They are used in space programs, wars, hospitals, schools and so on. Computers have made human life more easy, convenient and lightning fast. For example, in earlier days, if one had to send a message to someone in other country, it used to take months. But today, it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks. Computers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it.Moreover, future prospects of computers are very bright. From a computer as big as a room, it has now been minimized to the size of a palm. Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels. Research on making computerized drone soldiers (unmanned computer controlled) is going on. There is no end to the evolution of computers.However, everything has pros and cons. Computers have made humans over-dependent. Virus programs, privacy breach, leak of confidential documents, cyber attacks, identity theft, frauds etc. are some of its demerits, from a countless list. Computers expose children to vulgar materials. They have even invaded mental health of humans, for example, FAD (Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook). Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives. The recent case of Wikileaks, leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful.Nevertheless, with all the mentioned demerits, computers have provided security and sophistication too. Thus, dependence on computers is not a bad thing. However, one needs to be aware of all the pros and cons and beware of malicious things. Computer was invented for the benefit of mankind and it has fulfilled its objective. Human life today can't be imagined without computers, so not depending on them is out of question.";"In contemporary society, computers have become indelibly woven into the fabric of daily life, facilitating activities ranging from commerce to healthcare and even air travel. As we look toward the future, it is clear that our reliance on computers will only deepen. One prospective area of expansion is in artificial intelligence (AI), which could revolutionize industries such as education, where personalized learning programs could adapt to individual students’ needs. Furthermore, autonomous vehicles are set to redefine transportation, potentially reducing traffic accidents and improving mobility for the elderly and disabled.Another promising avenue is the integration of computers in environmental monitoring. Advanced algorithms and data analytics could enhance our understanding of climate change, enabling more proactive approaches to conservation and resource management. In healthcare, we may see a heightened role for computers in predictive analytics, where data mining could foresee outbreaks or patient deterioration, allowing timely interventions.However, this increasing dependence on computers raises significant concerns. While the efficiencies and innovations fostered by technology are undeniable, the risks of over-reliance cannot be ignored. Issues such as privacy and data security are paramount; as we entrust more personal information to computers, the risks of breaches and misuse escalate. Additionally, societal inequalities may deepen if access to these technologies remains uneven.Moreover, a dependency on computers raises existential questions regarding human skills. As tasks become automated, essential human capabilities such as critical thinking and problem-solving may languish. Should the computational systems fail, we could find ourselves ill-prepared to navigate the world without their aid.In conclusion, while the promise of an increasingly computer-dependent future holds remarkable potential, it is vital to approach it with a balanced perspective. Embracing technological advancements while remaining vigilant about their impacts is crucial for ensuring that society benefits as a whole without sacrificing essential human attributes and values."
61;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Education is important for the development of the world. Its a debatable issue whether universities should accept equal number of males and females in a course or not. However, since both genders are equally important, both must be given equal opportunities. Universities must admit both in equal numbers, depending on their choices.Right to education is a basic human right of both, males and females. The whole world aims for women empowerment, and to achieve this, females should be given equal opportunities as males. When universities will accept them in equal number, both genders will be able to nurture their talent and a healthy competitive environment will develop.Co-education helps both genders to gel well with each other. It helps them how to behave and cooperate and work together. For example, students studying in boy's colleges do not generally know how to talk to a female or behave in front of them. On the other hand, females studying in girl's colleges are too shy to face boys. Co-education will help to eradicate this kind of demerit in both. Universities giving both genders equal opportunities, will prepare them for future challenges and will help in the long run.Unfortunately, some male chauvinists think that women are incapable in particular fields, like maths, mechanical engineering, defense etc. This kind of gender biased approach is detrimental for the development of the society. Time and again, women have proved their mettle in every field. Women like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Mari Curie etc., are symbols of women's intelligence and skills.Thus, I firmly believe that both genders have equal rights and universities should accept them in equal numbers. Equality in education will help in development of the society. Both genders are the fulcrum of the society and none of them is superior or inferior. Choice of course should be the discretion of the student and their merit, irrespective of the gender. Educational rights must be given to both genders.;"The debate surrounding gender parity in university admissions has gained momentum in recent years, propelling discussions on whether institutions should maintain equal numbers of male and female students across all subjects. While the pursuit of gender equality is laudable, the proposal to enforce a rigid quota system may not be the most effective approach.On one hand, advocating for equal representation in traditionally male-dominated fields, such as engineering or computer science, addresses long-standing imbalances that can lead to systemic inequalities in the workforce. Gender diversity in academic settings fosters a more inclusive environment, promotes collaboration, and encourages a broad spectrum of perspectives in research and innovation. Imposing quotas could motivate educational institutions to employ specific strategies to attract and retain female students in these disciplines, ultimately contributing to a more balanced workforce.However, enforcing equal numbers of male and female admissions in every subject raises concerns about meritocracy. Admissions should ideally be based on individual talent, interest, and potential rather than a numerical quota. Such a policy could lead to the dilution of academic standards and undermine the achievements of students who may not meet the threshold solely due to artificially imposed gender balances.Additionally, it is essential to recognize that gender preferences vary across different fields; some subjects naturally attract more male students while others may inherently draw a higher number of females. Instead of enforcing a blanket policy for equal numbers, universities should focus on creating supportive environments and providing mentorship programs that encourage underrepresented genders to pursue various disciplines.In conclusion, while the aim of achieving gender equality in university admissions is vital, imposing rigid quotas may not serve the best interests of students or educational integrity. A more nuanced approach that fosters inclusivity while respecting individual capabilities seems more appropriate for addressing the challenges of gender imbalance in academia."
62;Do you agree or disagree with the statement: people will spend less time on cooking food;Perhaps, no issue in this world is as significant to people as cooking food, because it affects everybody in their daily lives. Some people hold the opinion that people should spend much time on food. However, I do think that people are likely to spend less time in cooking food. There are various reasons why I maintain this viewpoint, and among those reasons are two important ones.The first and foremost reason is that with the development of science and technology, more advanced kitchen facilities, such as the modern microwaves or the advanced pressure cookers, have been created and invented to help people prepare and cook food in a very short time. As a result, people nowadays just spend one hour to prepare a meal instead of two, even three hours like in the last 10 years. Actually, in recent years, there was a significant increase in the number of people from all walks of life realizing this valuable benefit of those technologies in doing their housework. And this figure still continuously go up along with the improvement of science and technology. Thus, it is certain that spending less time on cooking will be the main trend in near future.Another reason is that most of young people prefer to have meals at restaurants because they want to invest more time in their work or study to improve themselves. According to a recent survey, 89% of people have come to think that, since they have been put in the situation which is filled with competitions and pressures, they have to use a lot of time to work hard, to update themselves, to acquire all kinds of skills and so on. Thus, they find hard to have time to prepare and cook a meal. Even they have some spare time, they prefer to go out with friends to relax and relieve the pressure from work and study.Some people may argue that investing much time in cooking food will guarantee nutrition as well as quality of food for their family. To some extent, it is true. However, as a matter of fact, using technology or advanced facilities do not make food lose its nutrition and quality. Even, with the help of ozone machines, bacterias, mold spores, or pesticide in vegetables, fruits and foods will be killed and removed, thus health and life of eaters is assured. Besides, along with the high living standard, requirements of quality products in almost restaurants, nowadays, are under severe control and supervision by appropriate authorities. Consequently, it is quite easy to have a nutritious meal with guaranteed quality, but do not waste a lot of time.To sum up, if all those factors are contemplated, it is obviously found that there are many solid reasons to support my viewpoint. So, from what have been discussed above, I strongly affirm the conclusion that people will spend less time in cooking food.;In recent years, there has been a noticeable shift in how individuals approach cooking and meal preparation. I agree with the statement that people will spend less time on cooking food, and several factors contribute to this trend.First and foremost, busy lifestyles play a significant role in diminishing the time allocated for cooking. As societies advance, the demands of work and personal commitments often lead to longer working hours and packed schedules. With limited time, many individuals opt for convenience, resorting to takeout meals, pre-packaged foods, or quick microwave options instead of dedicating hours to preparing a wholesome meal from scratch.Moreover, the rapid advancement of technology has transformed the culinary landscape. The rise of kitchen gadgets and appliances like instant pots, air fryers, and meal kits, which promise quick and easy cooking solutions, encourages people to spend less time in the kitchen. These innovations reduce preparation and cooking times, allowing individuals to achieve satisfactory results without the traditional lengthy process. Additionally, the advent of food delivery services has further reduced the necessity of cooking at home as people can now enjoy a variety of cuisines with just a few taps on their smartphones.Lastly, changing cultural norms also contribute to reduced cooking time. In many societies, there is an increasing acceptance of eating out or ordering food rather than cooking at home. This shift is particularly evident among younger generations, who may prioritize social experiences and convenience over the traditional practice of cooking meals.In conclusion, the combination of busy lifestyles, technological advancements, and changing cultural expectations likely leads to reduced time spent on cooking. While cooking remains a valuable skill and a source of enjoyment for some, it is clear that many individuals are opting for more efficient and convenient options.
63;Traditional games are more useful than modern games in developing children's skills. To what extent do you agree?;Games have played a key role in children's growth, especially in terms of their abilities. With technological advances, children have more access to modern games currently. In such case, the relative importance of traditional games and modern games in children's developments of skills has become a frequent topic of discussion. For me, I believe parents and educators should attach more importance to traditional games.It is true that modern games may be, to some extent, beneficial for children to foster some skills, such as computer skills or the capacity to keep up with the latest trend. This is because children have to be proficient at computers and the Internet if they want to join online games, which, in fact, helps children acquire a particularly powerful skill at work in future. At the same time, children have the chance to experience the state-of-the-art technology, raising their awareness of innovation rather than stay conservative.However, I think traditional games are still indispensible in children's learning process, even much more essential than modern games, especially in modern society. One primary merit of traditional games is that they foster children's communication skills. Unlike most modern games which focus on the interactions between children and machines, traditional games provide a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere where children can chat, laugh and cooperate face to face. As a result, communicating with a variety of people will not be an issue for these children any more.Furthermore, it is the educational functions traditional games hold that keep them alive today. In fact, these traditional games were elaborately devised by educators and have been proven effective in improving children's skills on different aspects in previous teaching practices. By contrast, modern games are developed by game companies for the purpose of profits. Therefore, there is a risk that children may be exposed to unhealthy contents, such as violence or pornography, arranged in the games by such companies to secure financial survival.Thus, I would conclude that traditional games should be, by no means, ignored by parents and teachers with the advent of modern games. Only through traditional games can children be ensured a positive and healthy skills learning process.;The debate on whether traditional games or modern games are more beneficial in developing children's skills is an ongoing discussion among educators, parents, and child development experts. While both types of games have their merits, I believe that traditional games provide more comprehensive skill development for children.Traditional games, often played in outdoor settings and involving groups, foster essential social skills such as teamwork, communication, and conflict resolution. These games encourage children to interact face-to-face with their peers, leading to the development of strong interpersonal skills. For instance, games like tag or hide-and-seek require children to strategize and cooperate with each other, building their ability to work within a team. Moreover, traditional games often emphasize physical activity, promoting not only physical health but also the ability to navigate different environments and take risks safely.On the other hand, modern games, particularly video games, can enhance certain skills like hand-eye coordination and problem-solving abilities. Many modern games require players to think critically and make quick decisions. However, these games often lack the interpersonal interactions that are vital for emotional intelligence and social development. Furthermore, excessive screen time can lead to sedentary lifestyles and potential health issues in children.Nevertheless, it’s important to recognize that modern games can be educational and have their place in children's development, especially when they are designed to be enriching. Yet, they cannot completely replace the valuable lessons learned through traditional games. In conclusion, while modern games do have certain advantages, traditional games are more effective in cultivating a well-rounded skill set in children. The emphasis on physical activity, social interaction, and the development of core life skills found in traditional games highlights their importance in a child's overall development. Balancing both types of play might be ideal, but traditional games should remain a staple in children's activities for lasting skill development.
64;Some people said the government shouldn't put money on building theaters or sports stadiums but should spend more money on medical care and education. Do you agree or disagree?;How to allocate governmental budget efficiently has always been a hot topic of discussion among the public. Recently, some people argue that government should invest more on medical care and education rather than on entertaining or sports facilities. As far as I am concerned, this proposal is beneficial more to the society.Taking care of thousands of citizens who suffer from disease or illiteracy is more urgent and pragmatic than building theaters or sports stadiums. As a matter of fact, an uneducated person may barely appreciate musicals, whereas a physical damaged person, resulting from the lack of medical treatment, may no longer participate in any sports games. Therefore, providing education and medical care is more essential and prioritized to the government.Entertaining facilities such as cinemas, theaters and sports stadiums are mostly profit-oriented. Their existences are based on their marketing strategies, the condition of facilities and the volume of audience. The competition among each of these facilities is an inevitable part of the free market, which should not be interfered by government. Instead, the establishment of medical facilities or educational institutes is aimed to improve the health or education standard rather than earning profits, which deserves more funds from government.Furthermore, putting taxpayers' money on building theaters or sports stadiums is unfair to those who cannot use them. For example, not everyone is a fan of watching musicals on the spot. Therefore, it is a bit inappropriate to use the majority of citizens' tax funds to meet a minority of people's needs. That is the reason why sectors such as medical care and education deserve more governmental support, because they are accessed by every individual in our society on a daily basis.To summarize, I strongly agree that budgets should be allocated more on medical care and education rather than on building entertaining facilities, because the former is more essential, non-profit oriented to the public and can be accessed by the majority of citizens.;The debate surrounding government spending priorities is a contentious one, particularly when it comes to the allocation of funds towards cultural institutions like theaters and sports stadiums versus essential services such as medical care and education. I firmly agree with the perspective that government funds should prioritize medical care and education over the construction of recreational facilities.Firstly, medical care is a fundamental human need. Access to quality healthcare directly impacts the wellbeing of citizens and the overall productivity of a nation. In many countries, insufficient funding has led to overcrowded hospitals, inadequate treatment options, and a lack of preventative care programs. By prioritizing medical care, governments can ensure that their citizens have access to the healthcare services they need, regardless of their socioeconomic status. Improved health outcomes can lead to a more productive workforce and, consequently, a stronger economy.Similarly, education is a cornerstone of societal progress. Investment in education systems not only elevates individual potential but also fosters critical thinking, innovation, and informed citizenship. Education empowers individuals to break the cycle of poverty and contributes to social mobility. In contrast, spending money on theaters and sports venues may offer short-term entertainment benefits, but these funds could be better utilized in creating opportunities for future generations through enhanced educational resources and training programs.While cultural initiatives play an essential role in society—from fostering community spirit to promoting the arts—they should not come at the expense of basic human rights like health and education. Governments can encourage cultural growth through community programs and grants without dedicating large sums to build new stadiums or theaters. In conclusion, allocating government funds towards medical care and education is not only a moral obligation but a strategic investment in the nation's future. By prioritizing the health and education of its citizens, a government lays the groundwork for a prosperous, informed, and healthy society.
65;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It's pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Living in the 21st century, people are firmly convinced that technology is the main driving force behind productivity. Thus, every country has been promoting technological advances in the recent years, regardless of any potential problems it may bring about. Some people are worried modern technological technology is probably a hurdle to the preservation of traditional techniques and lifestyles. However, I believe their concern is groundless. Instead, technology plays a key role in promoting traditional techniques and lifestyles.In terms of time and space, technology makes it more efficient and effective to promote the traditional skills and ways of life. In the past, only when people went to the local place could they experience the specific traditional lifestyles. This means individuals who were engaged in work and therefore could not spare time to travel or restricted by traffic conditions had to miss the chance to appreciate the traditional skills. However, with the access to the Internet, one of the greatest innovations in modern society, humankind can acquire the traditional techniques displayed online anytime, anywhere.Additionally, technology enriches the way of displaying traditional cultural heritage, making it more vivid and appealing. For example, China has successfully promoted traditional techniques in the Shanghai World Expo, using a variety of state-of-the-art technological methods, such as robots and LED screens. In fact, many tourists around the world marveled at the perfect synthesis of the modern technology and the traditional culture.On the other hand, some people are concerned that technology may have a detrimental effect on the traditional lifestyles. They argue that people, especially youngsters, are crazier about fresh and advanced things, such as digital products, thus becoming indifferent to traditional techniques. But I believe this is not the issue because people tend to follow the trend back to the tradition in the recent years.Therefore, I will conclude that technology indeed supports the preservation and promotion of traditional techniques and lifestyles. Only when traditional culture is integrated with the modern technology can it be developed in the long run.;"The sentiment that the advancement of technology leads to the demise of traditional skills and ways of life is an argument that has gained traction in contemporary discourse. While it is indisputable that technological development transforms societies and can render certain traditional practices obsolete, it is overly reductive to suggest that efforts to preserve these traditions are pointless.On one hand, the rapid nature of technological progress can overshadow traditional skills, making them less relevant in a fast-paced, modern world. For instance, automation and digital tools have significantly altered industries such as agriculture and craftsmanship, where once, manual skills were paramount. This shift can lead to a decline in the transmission of knowledge from older generations to younger ones, as job opportunities become rooted in technology rather than in traditional methods.However, dismissing the value of traditional skills as obsolete overlooks their cultural significance and the lessons they hold. Many indigenous practices and artisanal skills are deeply intertwined with identity and heritage. They offer a sense of community and continuity that modern technology often fails to replicate. For example, the preservation of traditional weaving techniques not only sustains livelihoods but also fosters cultural pride and diversity. Efforts to maintain these practices can coexist with technological advancement; in fact, they can enhance it. Tourists often seek authentic experiences, sparking interest in traditional crafts that can thrive alongside modern industries.Ultimately, the debate should not be framed as a binary opposition between technology and tradition. Instead, we should recognize the potential for synergy between the two. Technologies can be harnessed to document, promote, and teach traditional skills rather than erase them. Therefore, while it is true that technology can transform ways of life, it is equally essential to advocate for the preservation and appreciation of traditional skills, ensuring they are honored and integrated into the rich tapestry of modern society."
66;Creative artists should be given freedom to express their ideas (words, pictures, music and films. However some people think government should take some restriction with them. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Innovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life; however, some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government. It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society; however, I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work. It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning. If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth? In a word, the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified.Let's then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals. It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc. I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.By way of conclusion, I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work; on the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful.";The debate over the freedom of creative artists to express their ideas is a complex and multifaceted issue. On one hand, artistic expression is crucial for the advancement of culture, the exploration of ideas, and the reflection of societal changes. From literature to visual arts, music, and film, creativity can challenge norms, provoke thought, and inspire action. The works of artists often serve as a mirror, reflecting the diverse voices within society, and allowing for a dialogue that can lead to progress.However, some argue that this freedom should come with certain restrictions imposed by governments. They contend that unregulated creative expression can result in the dissemination of harmful content, hate speech, or misinformation, which can undermine social harmony and incite violence. In this context, government intervention might be necessary to protect vulnerable communities and maintain a degree of decorum in public discourse. While it is important to acknowledge the need for some level of oversight, the challenge lies in defining where to draw the line between protection and censorship. Limiting artistic expression can create a slippery slope towards authoritarianism, where governments could potentially suppress dissenting voices under the guise of regulation. History has shown us that artistic freedom is often the first casualty in regimes that prioritize control over creativity, stifling innovation and diminishing the richness of cultural expression.In conclusion, while I understand the concerns regarding potential negative impacts of unrestricted creative expression, I strongly believe that artists should retain their freedom to express their ideas. Instead of imposing broad restrictions, governments should foster environments that encourage responsible creativity, promoting dialogue and understanding without compromising artistic integrity. It is essential to strike a delicate balance between safeguarding society and preserving the sanctity of artistic freedom, as the arts are fundamental to the human experience and cultural evolution.
67;The government should control the amount of violence in the media to reduce the number of violent crimes. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The soaring crime rate has led to the proposal that it is time for the government to take action to control the proliferation of violent scenes in media.Obviously, violence in the media is often portrayed as extreme as possible in order to attract audiences. This will definitely set a bad example for the immature audiences who, lacking correct parental guidance and abilities to differentiate the right from wrong, are prone to go astray by imitating the violent behaviors and committing real violent crimes as they regard the violence as reasonable and justifiable.On the other hand, media, such as TV or film, is considered as the correct information source regulated by the government. It should be reporting and reflecting true phenomenon in the society. Violence, as one of the facts in the real world, certainly has to be reported. However, excessive violence would offer misleading information to the public and exert detrimental influence to the society as well. It is recently reported in the news that a seventeen-year-old boy killed all his family members, one sister and two parents out of hatred and jealousy. In the real world, we are inclined to take extreme approach to tackle a small problem due to excessive violence exposure.We cannot deny that our society is occupied with the violent scenes and plots at present. What the government should do immediately is to strengthen censorship to control the amount of violence in media. Otherwise, the violent crime rate will rise continuously and out of control someday.;The debate surrounding the influence of media on violent behavior has been ongoing for decades. Some argue that government regulation of violent content in media is necessary to reduce crime rates, while others contest that such measures infringe upon freedom of expression. I contend that while media does have an impact on societal norms and behaviors, the extent to which government should control violent content is limited and should be balanced with individual rights.Research suggests that exposure to violent media can desensitize individuals or normalize aggressive behavior, particularly among impressionable youth. This raises legitimate concerns about the influence of films, video games, and television shows containing graphic violence. By implementing regulations, such as age restrictions and content ratings, the government can help shield vulnerable populations from potentially harmful material. Initiatives to promote media literacy can also empower consumers to critically assess the content they consume, enabling individuals to make informed choices about what they watch or play.However, it is crucial to acknowledge the role of personal responsibility and the multifaceted nature of violent crime. A simplistic correlation between media violence and actual violent behavior overlooks other contributing factors such as socioeconomic status, mental health issues, and family environments. Many individuals consume violent media without engaging in harmful behavior. Furthermore, excessive government intervention in media content can infringe upon artistic expression and the fundamental principle of free speech, which is essential in democratic societies.In conclusion, while there is merit in the notion that reducing violent media exposure can contribute to a decline in violent crime, the government's role should be one of guidance rather than heavy-handed control. By promoting responsible media consumption and protecting freedom of expression, society can address the complexities surrounding violence without stifling creativity and individuality.
68;Nowadays there are more opportunities for women than there were in the past. Some people think this situation has caused more problems than it has solved. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons or your answer;"The modern times have witnessed profound changes in most aspects of life, including the revolution of feminism. Women have been opened up to more chances than ever. This, contrary to some ideas, is a positive progress in human society from my point of view.To start with, the fairness between males and females is inevitable in such a developed society. Gone are the days when women could do nothing rather than stick to boring house work and take care of children. Women nowadays are much more active, they may be successful businessmen, they join the political world, they become scientists and so on. This is to say, the ""weaker"" gender as often be thought has enough right as well as ability to contribute to the development of human beings just like any other men, not to mention they even perform better in some fields.In the second place, the revolution in females' right has brought about many benefits not only to themselves but society as well. The financial burden of families, for instance, has decreased significantly with both the wives and the husbands working to earn money. What is more, women have the outstanding instinct to take up some careers like healthcare or human resource management due to their patience and elaboration.Admittedly, such changes do lead to some negative results like an upward trend in divorce rate or, under many circumstances, women find it difficult to balance their work and their traditional role as the wives. Also, children might enjoy less care from parents as they are both busy with their work. Yet everything has it upside and downside, women should find the best way to overcome such challenges.All things considered, in a society where females are given equal opportunities compared with males would obviously enjoy lots of benefits far outweighing its obstacles.";"The evolution of opportunities for women over the past few decades is a remarkable indicator of societal progress. However, the assertion that these advancements have caused more problems than they have resolved is a contentious one. I firmly disagree with this notion, as the increase in opportunities for women has significantly contributed to social, economic, and cultural development, albeit with certain challenges.Historically, women's roles were largely confined to domestic responsibilities, limiting their participation in various sectors. Today, women have greater access to education, professional careers, and leadership positions, which has resulted in a more dynamic and inclusive workforce. This empowerment is not just beneficial for women; it enriches society by utilizing a broader pool of talent and fosters innovation. A diverse workforce encourages different perspectives and ideas, leading to enhanced problem-solving and creativity in business and governance.Moreover, the increased representation of women in leadership roles has a profound impact on policy-making and community welfare. Women tend to advocate for issues such as healthcare, education, and family rights, leading to more holistic and compassionate societal structures. This shift has also encouraged a cultural transformation, whereby traditional gender roles are being questioned and redefined, paving the way for greater acceptance of diversity in all its forms.Nevertheless, the transition has not been without challenges. Women still face systemic barriers, such as wage gaps, underrepresentation in certain sectors, and societal pressures balancing career and family. However, these issues are not a result of increased opportunities but rather remnants of historical inequities. Addressing these challenges requires ongoing efforts rather than a regression of women's rights.In conclusion, the surge in opportunities for women has marked a significant advancement for society as a whole. While challenges persist, the benefits of increased female participation in all spheres of life far outweigh the problems. Rather than viewing these changes negatively, society should embrace and support the continued progression toward equality and empowerment for all."
69;Increasing the price of petrol is the best way to solve growing traffic and pollution problems. To what extent do you agree or disagree? What other measures do you think might be effective?;"As we read newspapers or watch TV, we have always been attracted by environmental problems such as traffic issues, air and water pollution questions. Initiatives should be taken to address the specific problems. As the impacts for those pollution and traffic issues are extremely far-reaching, it is insufficient to increase the petrol price only to solve problems, though it is a promising method discussed in the contemporary society.Specifically, price control institution has been used in plenty of social areas, for example, in the farming products and in the real estate area; however, whether it can work out for alleviating traffic and pollution pressure ought to be evaluated. On one hand, governments have a macro-economic perspective to control price in various areas according to social demands. Consequently, it seems not easy to increase petrol price instantly. On the other hand, pollutions are not just caused by the burning of oil, chemical pollutants, extra lights, also constitute considerable amount of pollution. In addition, the improvements of work efficiency also attribute to the speed-up of working pace, resulting in traffic jams during rush-hours.As illustrated before, several other solutions can be introduced to assist in reducing pollution and traffic problems. Primarily, authorities should spare no efforts in improving public transportation facilities, such as constructing more bus lines, in order to reducing the usage of private cars. Furthermore, temporarily targets should be set, with regard to the limitations of pollutants in a certain period of time, for example, a season. Plus with supervisory institutions built to find and address problems. Meanwhile, cultivating a sense of environmental protection would also work out, though it might not be into effect immediately, but in the long run, it would be a wise choice.In conclusion, addressing pollution and traffic issues only by increasing oil price is not adequate, while improving transportation facilities and building supervisory institution would be preferable, plus with the awareness of environmental protection being raised.";The assertion that increasing the price of petrol is the best way to address growing traffic and pollution issues raises important points of contention. While it is undeniable that higher fuel costs can discourage excessive car usage, thereby potentially alleviating congestion and reducing emissions, I believe that this approach alone is insufficient and could have adverse social effects. Raising petrol prices might effectively incentivize individuals to explore alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit, cycling, or walking. The economic principle of price elasticity suggests that as costs rise, demand tends to decrease. However, this measure disproportionately impacts lower-income individuals who rely on personal vehicles for commuting and may struggle to afford increased fuel expenses. Consequently, a simple price increase could exacerbate social inequalities, forcing disadvantaged populations into further economic hardship while failing to comprehensively tackle the underlying issues of urban mobility and air quality.To achieve a more holistic solution to traffic and pollution problems, a combination of strategies is necessary. For instance, investment in reliable and affordable public transportation infrastructure is vital. Enhanced public transport systems can provide a viable alternative to car travel, reducing reliance on private vehicles. Additionally, developing pedestrian-friendly urban designs and bike lanes can encourage non-motorized forms of transport, contributing to healthier lifestyles and cleaner air. Moreover, promoting the use of electric vehicles through subsidies and incentives could significantly diminish reliance on fossil fuels. Implementing strict emissions standards for industries and vehicles, in conjunction with public awareness campaigns about the environmental impact of car usage, could further drive behavioral change.In conclusion, while increasing petrol prices may provide temporary relief from traffic and pollution, it is crucial to adopt a multi-faceted approach that addresses economic equity and promotes sustainable transportation solutions. By implementing a comprehensive strategy, cities can more effectively tackle the pressing issues of congestion and environmental degradation.
70;Should advertisements be banned? To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Never in history was advertising industry so developed as in modern society and it has led to some adverse sentiments in public because some deliver exaggerated and fake information. Hence whether we should ban all the advertisements or not has aroused much controversy of the public. My view is that while some of them are disturbing, we can not overlook other merits the advertisements bring.First, it is unfair to restrict those public service advertisements which are creative and inspiring. In fact, they are not in the purpose of making profits but taking a role of disseminating valued culture, good moral traits and calling for helps for the disabled and the poor.Besides, it is obvious that publicizing brand image or a particular product of mass media could boost sales for companies. In a larger sense, it could simulate household spending and therefore promote the economic development of the whole country. A recent study shows that after launching an advertising campaign, the sales revenue would increase by 40%, which is the very fact to verify its positive influences on economic.That is not to say, however, that advertisements have no downsides. Of course, the advertising expenses lead to a higher product price and some of them express fake information, creating information asymmetry between consumers and companies. Yet, its merits still outweigh these downsides.Taken all together, advertisements have its social responsibility and contribute to economic growth. We can not deny all of them. However, if those with exaggerated and fake information could be banned, advertisements would be welcomed by more.;The debate over whether advertisements should be banned is multifaceted and invokes strong opinions on both sides. While some argue that advertisements play a crucial role in promoting competition and consumer knowledge, others contend that they can lead to negative societal impacts. I believe that while there are valid arguments for banning certain types of advertisements, a total prohibition is unwarranted.Proponents of banning advertisements often point to their potential for manipulation. Many advertisements are designed to exploit vulnerabilities, including youth and those with low self-esteem, encouraging unhealthy behaviors such as eating junk food or using harmful substances. For instance, tobacco and alcohol advertisements have glaring effects on public health, especially among impressionable demographics. In this light, a ban could protect consumers from making detrimental choices.Moreover, advertisements contribute to a culture of materialism, where self-worth is measured through possessions. This constant consumer pressure can lead to financial strain and even mental health issues. By removing advertisements, society can foster a healthier environment that promotes well-being over consumption.However, it is essential to recognize the benefits advertising brings. It informs consumers about new products, services, and technological advancements, thus fostering competition that can lead to better prices and innovation. Furthermore, advertisements can be a powerful tool for social change, highlighting issues such as sustainability or equality, inviting consumers to support meaningful movements.Rather than a blanket ban, a more effective approach would be to regulate advertising practices. Policies that limit misleading advertisements, target responsible advertising to vulnerable populations, and promote transparency could mitigate many concerns while retaining the advantages of advertising. In conclusion, while certain advertisements can be harmful, a nuanced approach that seeks to balance consumer protection with consumer freedom is preferable to an outright ban.
71;People have different ways of escaping the stress and difficulties of modern life. Some read, some exercise, others work in their gardens. What do you think are the best ways of reducing stress? Use specific details and examples to support your opinion.;In modern society, people often face many difficulties under great stress. Therefore, it is necessary for many to find ways to relax. Although miscellaneous people may apply diverse strategies, such as reading, watching movies, or working in their gardens, I argue that the most suitable method of reducing stress for modern people is by different kinds of exercise, which can not only improve health conditions but also bring positive emotions.It is not surprised that exercise play a crucial role in ameliorating physical health. Any kinds of sports, such as jogging, swimming, or playing basketball, can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system. Moreover, these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body. The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity. Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years, which mainly results from insufficient exercises.Sports activities can improve mental health as well. When people exercise, the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine. This hormone can delight one's mind, creating positive feelings. Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one's heavy burdens. Moreover, rigorous exercise can also hone one's will, which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks.In a nutshell, many activities can let humans relax. Nevertheless, I assert that the best way of diminishing stress is by exercises, which can benefit everyone not only physically but also mentally.;"In the fast-paced world we inhabit today, stress has become an integral part of modern life. As individuals strive to balance work, family, and personal obligations, finding effective ways to unwind is crucial. While various methods exist to alleviate stress, I believe that exercise, mindfulness practices, and engaging with nature are among the most effective.Exercise stands out as a powerful stress reliever. Physical activity triggers the release of endorphins, often referred to as “feel-good” hormones. For instance, a brisk walk or a session at the gym provides not only a distraction from everyday worries but also a sense of accomplishment and improved mood. Research supports this notion, showing that regular physical exercise can reduce anxiety and promote overall mental well-being. Personally, I've found that incorporating a daily jog into my routine helps me clear my mind and boosts my energy levels, making me more resilient to stress.Mindfulness practices, such as meditation and deep breathing exercises, are also effective in combating stress. By focusing on the present moment, these techniques enable individuals to detach from their worries about the past or future. For example, dedicating just ten minutes each day to meditation can foster a sense of calm and clarity. Many people, including myself, have experienced noticeable benefits from mindfulness, such as reduced anxiety and improved concentration.Finally, returning to nature offers a refreshing escape from daily pressures. Gardening, hiking, or simply spending time outdoors can significantly lower stress levels. Nature has an inherent calming effect; studies have shown that even short walks in green spaces can enhance mood and reduce feelings of frustration or anxiety. Personally, working in my garden allows me to connect with the earth and find joy in small accomplishments, fostering a sense of peace and contentment.In summary, while there are various ways to manage stress in modern life, I believe exercise, mindfulness, and engagement with nature are among the most effective methods. By incorporating these practices into our daily routines, we can enhance our well-being and equip ourselves to face life’s challenges with greater resilience."
72;In the modern world, the image (photograph or film) is becoming a more powerful way of communication than the written word. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""A picture is worth a thousand words"" is a popular maxim that is being used for a very long time. This strongly depicts the power of images in conveying messages, ideas, or opinions to people. Nevertheless, the importance of written word can never be denied as it is also another way of communication that is commonly used. Hence, I agree only to certain degree that in today's world, image serves as a more effective means of communication.Firstly, pictures can influence the way people think. For example, nowadays horrendous images are displayed on the cigarette boxes to illustrate the consequences of smoking. As a result, statistics show a slight reduction in the number of smokers, indicating that they realize the effects of the negative habit. Not only that, the magnificent photograph captured by Kevin Carter, which portrayed a starving Sudanese child struck by extreme poverty has successfully highlighted the plight faced by the citizens in Sudan. Apart from that, images are also widely used in newspapers, magazines and advertisements. Thus, it is undeniable that images in the absence of words can obviously claim the attraction of many.Looking from another perspective, written words are also vital in order to spread across certain messages. With only pictures, everyone is left to their own interpretation on how they perceive the images. Nonetheless, this is different when words are used to explain what the illustration is about. Furthermore, the primary way of educating students is also by this way. Academic textbooks these days are laden with words besides pictures to guide the readers to comprehend better.To conclude, both images and words go hand in hand and one cannot wholly emphasise on only one aspect, either images or words. Hence, for a more meaningful communication, these two elements have their respective roles to play: image to exemplify and words to describe a particular subject.";In the rapidly evolving landscape of communication, the image—whether in the form of photographs or films—has increasingly come to overshadow the written word as a predominant means of conveying messages. I largely agree with the assertion that visual media holds a more powerful place in modern communication, though it is important to recognize the continued value of written expression.One of the primary reasons for the rise of images as a dominant form of communication is their ability to convey complex emotions and narratives swiftly and universally. A single photograph can evoke countless feelings, encapsulating a moment in time that words often struggle to match. For instance, iconic images from historical events—such as the fall of the Berlin Wall or the civil rights movement—have had a more profound impact on public consciousness than any written account. Similarly, films can immerse viewers in stories and experiences through a combination of visuals, sound, and movement, allowing for an emotional connection that is often more compelling than text alone.Moreover, the advent of social media has exacerbated the visual-centric nature of modern communication. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok prioritize images and short video content, suggesting a cultural shift towards visual literacy as a primary mode of expression. Content shared in this format is typically more engaging and shareable, resulting in wider dissemination of ideas compared to lengthy articles or written posts.However, it is essential to acknowledge the enduring significance of the written word. Literature, scholarly articles, and even well-crafted social media posts can provide nuanced arguments and context that images may lack. Written communication fosters critical thinking and allows for deep dives into complex subjects.In conclusion, while the image has undoubtedly become a more powerful tool for communication in the modern world, the written word retains its importance. Both forms of expression complement each other, highlighting the multifaceted nature of communication in our society.
73;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.;It is certainly true that some languages are disappearing day by day over the world. Some people, therefore, harbour a view saying that governments should preserve those by spending some budgets on them. But the others do not believe it is possible. In my opinion, this viewpoint needs to be examined thoroughly and this essay will discuss this issue.First and foremost, it is easy to realize that languages, especially oral language, are a quite major part of culture of a country. It helps people distinguish between nations and even regions in a country. The clearance of minority of language means that a national traditional, customs and habitants do not exist. Governments should spend money on keeping and preserving these things for the rich diversity of cultures which make our world more interesting. What is more, it is a pride of the country with a rage of culture which is easy to educate people to love their country more.On the other hand, there are some drawbacks from saving minority languages. Although governments invest money on doing that, it is hard to gain the good results. As evidence of this, there are a few people, particularly the youngsters, do not pay attention on collecting and studying those. These kinds of languages are usually difficult and unpopular. In addition, the preservations need a long time to gather, restore all information as well as train in the educational centre. If they do not try their best, their protection can be halted and waste of money.In a nutshell, I am convinced that all languages should be preserved and developed as much as possible. All people should give a hand to do this better and governments play a vital role on encouraging and distributing those.;"The extinction of languages is a pressing issue that bears significant cultural implications. With countless languages dwindling in speaker numbers, the debate over whether governments should allocate funds to preserve these languages or not garners attention. Proponents of funding argue that each language embodies a unique cultural identity and a wealth of historical knowledge. Languages carry the traditions, stories, and values of communities, and their extinction represents the loss of diversity in human experience. Investing in these languages may not only safeguard cultural heritage but also strengthen community bonds and promote diversity.On the other hand, critics contend that allocating public funds to save languages spoken by very few individuals may not be the most prudent use of taxpayer money. They often argue that resources should be directed towards more pressing societal issues, such as education, healthcare, or infrastructure. As global communication becomes more standardized through dominant languages, such as English, the practicality of conserving ‘minority’ languages comes into question. Critics assert that language preservation can often become an ideological effort rather than a functional one, leading to its promotion at the expense of more immediate needs.In my opinion, while the arguments against funding are valid, the preservation of endangered languages is essential. It is not merely about saving words; it is about retaining the richness of human culture and ensuring that future generations have access to the worldviews held within these languages. However, a balanced approach should be taken, where funding for language preservation is accompanied by strategic initiatives that intertwine cultural education with broader social benefits. This can ensure that endangered languages are supported while also addressing the pressing needs of the communities that speak them."
74;Many people think arts and music do not improve the quality of life, and the government should spent money on other things rather than the arts such as music and painting, to what extent agree or disagree_;My view is that the government should give priorities to invest more money on the basic social welfares such as education and housing instead of subsidizing arts relative programs.Art is not the key determination of quality of life, but education is. In order to make people better off, it is more urgent for governments to commit money to some fundamental help such as setting more scholarships in education section for all citizens. This is simply because knowledge and wisdom is the guarantee of the enhancement of the quality of people's lives for a well-rounded social system.Admittedly, art, to some extent, serve a valuable function about enriching one's daily lives, for example, it could bring release one's heavy burden of study pressure and refresh human bodies through a hard day from work. However, it is unrealistic to pursuit of this high standard of life in many developing countries, in which the basic housing supply has still been a huge problem with plenty of lower income family have squeezed in a small tight room. By comparison to these issues, the pursuit of art seems unimportant at all.To conclude, art could play an active role in improving the quality of people's lives, but I think that governments should attach heavier weight to other social issues such as education and housing needs because those are the most essential ways enable to make people a decent life.;The debate over the allocation of government funds often pits the arts against other societal needs, with critics arguing that spending on music and painting fails to enhance the quality of life in tangible ways. However, I contend that arts and music play a vital role in enriching our society and should be funded accordingly.Firstly, the arts foster cultural identity and community engagement. Music and painting serve as mediums through which individuals express their emotions, beliefs, and experiences. They can unite communities, promoting social cohesion and understanding across diverse backgrounds. Public art installations and community music festivals create opportunities for residents to come together, share experiences, and cultivate a sense of belonging. Thus, investing in the arts can have profound effects on community spirit and social harmony.Moreover, participation in arts and music has been shown to have significant mental health benefits. Engaging in creative activities can reduce stress, combat anxiety, and alleviate depression. Schools that integrate music and arts into their curricula often see improvements in student well-being and academic performance. By providing funding for the arts, the government invests in the overall mental health of its citizens, resulting in a more productive and happy population.Furthermore, the economic impact of the arts should not be underestimated. Arts and culture industries generate jobs, stimulate local economies, and attract tourists. Cities known for their vibrant arts scenes often see increased economic activity, benefiting local businesses and creating employment opportunities.In conclusion, while there are many pressing needs within society that require funding, dismissing the importance of arts and music overlooks their integral role in enhancing quality of life. Investment in these areas leads to stronger communities, improved mental health, and economic benefits. Therefore, I strongly advocate for continued governmental support for the arts.
75;Some people say the government should pay for the health care and education, but others say that it is not the government's responsibility. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Despite the development of modern society, the health care and education still remain the basic rights of citizens. And a much debated issue these days is whether or not the government should be responsible for citizens' health care and education.Some people argue that it is the government that should be obligated to fund the health care and education for citizens. This is because citizens enjoy the right to live in a harmonious and stable environment, which should be enabled by the government, the leader of the society. If citizens had no access to health care and education, their physical health and psychological soundness would be at risk. As a result, such people might fail to get cured in time, thus influencing their working efficiency, which would destabilize the production of the industry. Also, without sufficient guidance of teachers, these citizens might misbehave or even commit crimes, posing a threat to other citizens' security. Therefore, the government should be accountable for citizens' health care and education to keep society safe and stable.On the other hand, some people oppose the argument, saying it is a waste of public money for the government to subsidize health care and education of each citizen in society, since a great number of people, in fact, have had the capacity to pay for the both privately. Instead, the government should give priority to more pressing problems related to social members' wellbeing, such as soaring crime rate, AIDS epidemic or the shortage of infrastructure, which are requiring financial resources from the government to address.Personally, I think the government should fund the deprived for their health care and education, who are the group in real need for the authority's help. At the same time, citizens available for the both should encourage the government to allocate money to more urgent areas. After all, the harmonious society calls for the joint efforts of the government and citizens.;"The debate over whether the government should fund healthcare and education is a contentious topic that elicits strong opinions on both sides. Advocates of government-funded healthcare and education argue that it is a fundamental right of every citizen to have access to these essential services, regardless of their economic status. They believe that when the government invests in these areas, it promotes social equity and provides a safety net for the most vulnerable populations. By guaranteeing access to healthcare and education, the government can improve overall public health, increase literacy rates, and foster an educated workforce, which ultimately benefits the economy. In this view, social welfare programs are investments in the nation’s future and contribute to a more cohesive and productive society.On the other hand, opponents of government-funded healthcare and education argue that such policies can lead to inefficiency and a drain on taxpayer resources. They contend that government involvement can create bureaucratic obstacles that hinder innovation and responsiveness in service delivery. Moreover, some believe that individuals should take personal responsibility for their own healthcare and education. By fostering competition through privatized systems, proponents of this view argue that the quality of services can improve and be more tailored to individual needs. This perspective suggests that government intervention might stifle entrepreneurship and the potential for private initiatives that could yield better outcomes in both sectors.In my opinion, while it is essential to recognize the potential drawbacks of government involvement, I believe that the government should play a significant role in funding healthcare and education. Access to quality healthcare and education should not be determined by one’s income. A citizen's health and knowledge are critical for societal progress; thus, government investment in these areas is not merely an expense but an investment in the nation’s social and economic well-being. Balancing public funding with private initiatives may yield the optimal solution, combining the benefits of both approaches."
76;Many people think zoos that keep wild animals in a man-made environment should be no longer exist in the 21st century. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Children tend to visit zoos where various kinds of wild creatures could be seen. When it comes to whether zoos should exist on contemporary society, animal-right activists strongly recommended that wildlife belong to natural environment and zoos should be banned. I would not go along with their viewpoint as zoos have irreplaceable benefits in terms of animal preservation and children education.There is no denying that our environment is damaged day by day due to the fact that excessive pursuit of economic development at expense of eco-system, which pose a great threat to the survival of wild animals. In contrast, zoo is a good alternative choice for protecting animals as various animals could be better protected by specialized staff. Once the animal got sick, professional vet will help them promptly. Thanks to the considerate care, the diversity of wild animal could be guaranteed.Additionally, zoos afford a platform to education teenagers, helping to establish eco-friendly behavior towards animals. In the zoos, even though wild animals are caged, they have capability to walk in a limited area. When children pay a visit to the zoos, they still could observe the eating behavior or leisure activities among animals, which would definitely enrich their knowledge associated with different animals. Further, children could acquire the information regarding how to protect wild animals according to guided tour or volunteers.On the other hand, complained about the drawbacks of zoos are often heard. It is true that some zoos are lack of systematic management which attributes to numerous wild animals die because of food shortage. Also, being caged in the zoos for long render wildlife lost the ability to survive in nature where is full of cruel competition among various animals.In order to protect animals, from my perspective, zoos offer a good man-made environment which could prolong the life span of wild animals and cultivate the notion of protecting animals. What the zoos should do is improvement of the management system and use the income wisely in preserving wild animals better.;The existence of zoos has sparked considerable debate, particularly in the context of the 21st century, where ethical considerations and animal welfare have become increasingly prioritized. While some argue that zoos should no longer exist due to the unnatural and often detrimental conditions they impose on wild animals, others contend that they play an essential role in conservation and education. I strongly align with the opinion that traditional zoos, which confine wild animals within artificial environments, should be reevaluated or phased out. Many zoos fail to provide habitats that cater to the complex needs of wild animals. Research has shown that confinement can lead to a range of psychological issues, such as depression and anxiety in animals, manifesting in stereotypical behaviors. In an age where wildlife conservation is possible through more humane and effective means, retaining facilities that prioritize entertainment over well-being seems increasingly unjustifiable.Additionally, advancements in technology offer alternative ways for people to experience wildlife without compromising animal welfare. Virtual reality and augmented reality technologies can simulate natural habitats and behavioral interactions, allowing people to learn about and appreciate animals without the ethical burdens that come with keeping them in captivity. Conversely, proponents of zoos argue that they serve critical functions, such as breeding endangered species and educating the public about wildlife conservation. However, reputable conservation organizations are increasingly focusing on in-situ conservation efforts—protecting animals in their natural habitats—rather than relying on ex-situ solutions like zoos. In conclusion, while there may be a role for specialized sanctuaries or rehabilitation centers that prioritize animal welfare, traditional zoos must evolve or cease to exist in the 21st century. The well-being of wild animals should take precedence in a world where compassion and ethical considerations are at the forefront of societal values.
77;Some industrialized countries have serious environmental problems. The damage to the environment is an inevitable result when a country tends to improve the standard of living. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Currently, a great number of countries have pushed forward their economies by developing national industries. However, some people are worried that the economic targets in industrialized countries may be attained at the expense of the ecosystems. From my perspective, I think flourishing economies can go hand in hand with environmental preservation.Admittedly, some countries may place economic developments ahead of environmental protection, thus ruining the local environments. As these needy countries lack adequate financial and human resources, advanced technologies and experience, they have to rely on natural resources to maintain their living standards. Besides, people in the poverty-stricken areas are not likely to be equipped with knowledge to preserve the ecosystems. As a result, unchecked and reckless uses of the local raw materials may happen, which can put a strain on the natural resources. In this view, the economic development and environmental protection can be conflicting.However, I believe the booming economy can be closely linked to the preservation of the environment. With people raising their awareness of the green economy, the products free of pollutants are increasingly prevalent among clients, which means eco-friendly businesses can make a favorable impression on customers today, triggering sales. For example, electronic bicycles powered by clean energy resources have been well received among people in recent years.Furthermore, taking environmental consequences seriously can enhance working efficiencies. If a firm is environmentally conscious, it may have to make optimal use of its resources to improve its production lines and equipment, which can boost productivity. Therefore, it may spur its economic development. On the other hand, without the requirement of environmental preservation, the firm would still consume a vast amount of energy which constitutes a large part of its operational costs, being a hurdle to the economic development.Therefore, I would conclude that thriving economies and the preservation of ecosystems can be promoted simultaneously. On the other hand, I suppose the developed countries should support the underdeveloped areas by providing financial resources, technologies and experience so that the environmental problems can be effectively alleviated in these areas.;"The relationship between industrialization and environmental degradation is a critical topic in contemporary discourse. While it is evident that industrialized countries frequently face significant environmental challenges, the assertion that damage to the environment is an inevitable consequence of striving to improve the standard of living merits careful examination.On one hand, the rapid industrialization associated with the pursuit of a better standard of living often leads to pollution, deforestation, and the depletion of natural resources. As industries expand to meet the growing demands of society, they tend to prioritize economic growth over environmental sustainability. For example, the rise of factory production has led to air and water pollution, adversely impacting public health and ecosystems. Countries like China and India have experienced dramatic industrial growth, yet they grapple with severe environmental fallout, including toxic smog and contaminated waterways.Nevertheless, it is crucial to assert that environmental damage is not an unavoidable outcome. The advancements in technology and increased awareness regarding sustainability offer avenues through which industrialized nations can achieve economic growth while protecting the environment. Sustainable development models, such as the implementation of cleaner technologies, renewable energy sources, and waste management systems, demonstrate that it is indeed possible to pursue a high standard of living without compromising the planet. Many Scandinavian countries exemplify this balance; they maintain robust economies while prioritizing environmental health through progressive policies and regulations.In conclusion, while it is true that many industrialized nations face serious environmental issues linked to their pursuit of a higher standard of living, these problems are not inevitable. With conscious efforts towards sustainability and innovation, it is possible to harmonize economic growth with environmental stewardship. Thus, the responsibility lies in the hands of policymakers and industries to embrace practices that prioritize both human prosperity and ecological integrity."
78;Some peopleÊargue that the government should spend money on public services and facilities, but not on the arts. Do you agree or disagree?;As people have raised their democratic awareness in recent years, they are caring more about how the tax expenditure is distributed by the government. As a result, some people suggest that the tax money should be allocated to publically beneficial services instead of arts. However, from my perspective, I think arts are supposed to be included in the government's investment as well.Admittedly, the government should give priority to public services and facilities. This is because the government plays the role of a leader among citizens, which should discharge the responsibility of making optimal use of the tax money to keep society safe and stable. Simultaneously, public services such as education system or medical care can meet people's basic demand of survival, security and knowledge, thus making them feel comfortable, which can lower the crime rate. Therefore, public services and facilities should be given adequate attention by the authorities to maintain social stability.On the other hand, I believe arts should by no means been disregarded by the government. Individually, arts can enrich people's cultural lives. Currently, people are increasingly occupied with their work and studies due to the stiff competition. Consequently, they require various entertainment such as music, movies or books to them ease their minds and release pressure. Without arts, people would be at risk of suffering psychological problems.From the point of the local community, funding arts is beneficial to the local cultural and economic development. Cultural heritage constitutes an essential part of arts. This means preserving local arts may promote the preservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only helps the local people have a sense of belonging but also contributes to the booming local tourism industry. In this view, arts serve cultural and economic purposes.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that public services and facilities are an integral part of the government expenditure. At the same time, the authorities should also respect the value of arts which are individually and socially advantageous.;"In contemporary discourse, a contentious debate has emerged regarding the allocation of governmental funding, specifically whether resources should be directed towards public services and facilities or the arts. While public services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure are undeniably essential for societal welfare, I contend that the government should not neglect the arts, as they play a vital role in cultural enrichment and social development.Firstly, public services are foundational to a functioning society; they provide the necessary framework for health, safety, and education. However, the arts contribute significantly to the cultural fabric of a nation, fostering a sense of identity and community. Artistic expression gives voice to diverse perspectives and experiences, creating a rich tapestry of shared narratives that is crucial for societal cohesion.Moreover, investment in the arts can have tangible economic benefits. The creative sector generates jobs, stimulates tourism, and can enhance property values. Cities known for their vibrant cultural scenes often attract investment and talent, thereby driving local economies. For instance, places like Austin, Texas, which is renowned for its music and arts festivals, benefit economically from the influx of visitors and artists, thus reinforcing the idea that supporting the arts is not just a matter of cultural importance but a pragmatic approach to economic growth.Additionally, the arts promote critical thinking and creativity, skills that are essential in an increasingly complex and technological world. Encouraging creativity in education through arts programs can prepare students for future challenges, making them more adaptable and innovative in the workforce.In conclusion, while it is imperative that government funding prioritizes essential public services, it is equally important to support the arts. The arts enrich society, bolster the economy, and cultivate a generation of creative thinkers. Balancing funding for both sectors is not just beneficial, but necessary for a well-rounded and progressive society."
79;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Since the time they were introduced zoos have both been supported and criticized. Many believe that zoos could be very entertaining and ecologically important, whereas, others think that keeping animals in captivity is totally wrong. Both sides will be discussed before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, critics of zoology argue that keeping animals in captivity is wrong because animals should be considered non-human persons and they should have the right of having freedom. This is so unfair for them to be taken out of their natural environment and to be kept in small enclosures. That is because, many zoos, especially the ones in developing countries, do not provide care and attention which their animals require. The animals are often undernourished and do not have sufficient quality and quantity of medical treatment. In addition, sometimes animals from hot countries have to survive in the cold winter of somewhere in Europe.On the other hand, the advocators believe that zoos provide the public with good entertainment and also help to ensure the balance of the ecology. Many people, especially young children enjoy going to zoos and see their favorite animals, cute baby-born animals and the animals that are from the different corners of the world. Zoos provide educational information about the lives of different animals to the public. Also, zoos play an important role in reserving many breeds of animal and preventing them from being missing from life. This is due to the fact that, in zoos, animals are kept in enclosures which simulate their own habitats and also endangered animals are being protected from their predators or hunters. Thus zoos are needed to keep the nature balanced.In conclusion, both of the arguments have strong supports, but in my own view, more good come from zoos than bad. However, it is hoped that the standards of zoos should be leveled up to ensure that the animals in zoos are provided with good care and attention.;The debate surrounding the ethics of keeping animals in zoos is complex and multifaceted, yet I firmly believe that animals should be free and not confined to zoos. While zoos argue that they play a critical role in conservation and education, the inherent rights of animals to live in their natural habitats outweigh these justifications.Firstly, animals in the wild exhibit natural behaviors that are often suppressed in captivity. In their natural environments, animals hunt, roam vast distances, form social groups, and raise their young without interference. Conversely, in zoos, animals are often kept in enclosures that are inadequate in size and stimulation. For instance, many elephants in zoos are known to display signs of stress and psychological distress due to their limited space and lack of activities that mimic their natural behaviors. This captivity leads to a life of boredom and frustration, which is detrimental to their overall well-being.Moreover, the argument that zoos contribute to conservation is often overstated. While some zoos participate in breeding programs for endangered species, these efforts rarely address the root causes of endangerment such as habitat loss and poaching. Instead of supporting zoos, we should invest in conservation initiatives that protect natural habitats and promote biodiversity in the wild. Organizations that focus on habitat preservation and wildlife sanctuaries allow animals to live freely while providing a safe environment away from human encroachment.Additionally, education can be achieved through alternative methods that do not involve captivity. Virtual reality experiences and documentaries enable people to learn about animals in their natural settings, fostering empathy and understanding without imposing confinement on these creatures. In conclusion, despite the arguments made for the conservation efforts in zoos, the ethical implications of confining animals cannot be ignored. Animals deserve the right to live freely in their native habitats, and we should pursue more humane alternatives that prioritize their welfare.
80;Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, picture, music or film) in whichever way they wish. There should be no government restrictions on what they do. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?;Artists in most countries are given the freedom to express their thoughts in whatever they do. Nevertheless, some argue that there should be government restrictions in order to limit their opinions. I however, agree to this only to a certain extent and believe that the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece.First and foremost, if there is control over artists' ideas, they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run. It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies. For example, paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times. In short, without any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists.Furthermore, it is every human's right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation. Today, many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries. Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country. To illustrate this further, the famous movie '3 Idiots' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn. Thus, human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely.Looking from another perspective, there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted. They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country. To cite an example, Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace. In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society. Nonetheless, I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts.To conclude, it is now evident that there should not be any restrictions on artists' work. Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves as ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations. Hence, even though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects, I certainly believe that there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas and thus, I strongly believe there should be no restrictions on them.;"The debate surrounding the freedom of creative artists to express their ideas without government restrictions is a complex one, raising questions about individual liberties, societal norms, and the potential impacts of art on culture. I tend to agree that artists should generally be allowed the freedom to express their ideas as they wish; however, I do acknowledge that some boundaries must exist to uphold societal values and protect individuals.Creative expression is a cornerstone of human communication and innovation. Art serves as a reflection of society, often challenging norms and inspiring change. Historical movements in art and literature have catalyzed social progress, pushing society to rethink established paradigms. For instance, works by artists like Picasso or filmmakers such as Stanley Kubrick transcended their time by critiquing socio-political issues. Without the freedom to explore controversial themes, art risks becoming complacent and unrepresentative of the diverse human experience.Nevertheless, absolute freedom can lead to potential harm. For instance, art that spreads hate or promotes violence can negatively influence vulnerable audiences. In such cases, some government regulation may be necessary to ensure that the rights and safety of individuals are protected. The challenge lies in striking a balance: while creative expression should not be stifled, there must be a framework to prevent the exploitation of that freedom to promote harmful ideologies.In conclusion, I advocate for a significant degree of freedom in artistic expression, recognizing its vital role in cultural discourse and innovation. However, responsible oversight should exist to guard against potential abuses of this freedom. A society benefits from diverse voices, but it must also prioritize the health and safety of its members, ensuring that artistic expression does not come at the expense of others' rights and dignity."
81;Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone's life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is negative. Discuss both views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.Ê;Nowadays, the use of advertisement through different forms of media such as newspapers, radio and television has become very prevalent, so it is thought to be a necessary part of today's society. Many believe that advertising has brought great benefits to lives therefore it should be considered a positive activity while others have held a complete different idea about this. Both views will be critiqued before a reasonable conclusion is drawn.First, it is generally understood that advertising is carried out with the main purpose of promoting different products and services or encouraging people to consume more. Advertisements are, therefore, very important for many businesses to increase sales and hence profits. Also, to consumers, advertising can bring them many benefits. For example, customers of telecommunication services will have an idea about the current offers of different companies and hence they can compare them and then have a better decision in choosing their internet or mobile phone plans. From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.However, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results. Therefore, advertising is believed by many, a financial burden to businesses.In conclusion, after analyzing the pros and cons of advertising, both of the views have strong support, but it is felt that more good comes from advertising than bad. Thus, the idea that advertising is a positive part of life can be more supported.;Advertising is an omnipresent element of modern society, shaping our perceptions and consumer behaviors. Opinions vary on whether its influence is largely beneficial or detrimental, and exploring both perspectives reveals a complex landscape.Proponents of advertising argue that it serves essential functions in the economy and society. Firstly, advertising provides essential information about products and services, enabling consumers to make informed choices. For instance, a well-designed advertisement can highlight a new, eco-friendly product that consumers might not have been aware of otherwise. Moreover, advertising fosters competition among businesses, which can lead to improved quality and innovation. When companies strive to attract customers, they may invest in better product development and overall customer service, benefitting consumers.Conversely, critics of advertising assert that it often promotes materialism and unrealistic expectations. Many advertisements bombard consumers with images of idealized lifestyles that are unattainable, leading to feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction. For example, beauty product ads frequently showcase models with flawless skin, which can contribute to negative body image among viewers. Additionally, some advertisements employ manipulative techniques, targeting vulnerable populations, such as children, who may not have the critical skills to discern between necessity and desire. This can lead to unhealthy spending habits and a culture of overconsumption.In my opinion, advertising is a double-edged sword. While it has the potential to inform and enhance competition, the negative impacts on consumer psychology and societal values cannot be overlooked. It is crucial for consumers to cultivate discernment and critical thinking in response to advertising messages, while regulatory bodies should ensure ethical advertising practices are maintained.Ultimately, a balanced approach—leveraging the benefits of advertising while safeguarding against its pitfalls—will serve society best. This way, we can harness its power for good while minimizing its potential harms.
82;The nuclear power provide clean and cheap energy.ÊThe advantages of nuclear technology outweigh the disadvantages. Do you agree or disagree ?;The topic of nuclear technology frequently generates a heated debate with proponents maintaining that nuclear power provides a source of efficient and economical energy while opponents argue that atomic technology is uncontrollable and very dangerous to handle. As far as my opinion is concerned, I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power. I have several reasons to believe its disadvantages outnumber the few advantages.First and foremost reason is that pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons. Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons. If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage.Another reason to fortify my opinion is that even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity. For example recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area. This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable.Last but not least, while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power. Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it. This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material.To sum it up, from above mentioned facts it can easily be deduced that nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages. Thus I suggest that use of nuclear technology should be discouraged even for civil purposes.;The debate over nuclear power has intensified as the world grapples with climate change and the urgent need for clean energy sources. Proponents argue that nuclear energy provides a reliable, low-emission alternative to fossil fuels, while critics often point out the potential dangers associated with nuclear technology. However, I contend that the advantages of nuclear power outweigh its disadvantages, particularly in the contexts of energy security, environmental impact, and economic viability.Firstly, nuclear power is one of the most effective means of producing large amounts of energy with minimal greenhouse gas emissions. Unlike coal or natural gas, which release significant CO2 when burned, nuclear reactors generate electricity through fission, a process that emits no direct carbon emissions. This characteristic positions nuclear energy as a crucial player in the global efforts to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate the effects of climate change.Moreover, nuclear power is incredibly efficient and can operate continuously for long periods, providing a stable energy supply. Unlike renewable sources such as wind and solar, which can be intermittent, nuclear power plants can produce energy reliably, thus ensuring a consistent flow to meet consumer demand. This reliability enhances energy security, minimizing the risk of blackouts and safeguarding economies from fluctuations in energy prices.Critics often cite the catastrophic risks associated with nuclear technology, such as the potential for accidents and the challenges of radioactive waste management. While these concerns warrant serious consideration, advancements in technology have significantly improved the safety of modern reactors. Additionally, many countries have implemented stringent regulations to manage waste disposal effectively.In conclusion, the benefits of nuclear power—its low emissions, reliability, and efficiency—significantly outweigh the disadvantages. As nations strive for cleaner energy alternatives, investing in nuclear technology can play a pivotal role in achieving a sustainable energy future, ultimately contributing to the fight against climate change.
83;Some people argue that the government should give every unemployed person a mobile phone and should make sure they have access to the Internet. They believe this is the best way of using the public money to reduce the problem of unemployment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Today, the rate of unemployment is on the rise and is seriously being debated by many. Some opine that the best method to minimize this problem is by providing the unemployed with hand phones that have access to the Internet. They also believe that this solution is the most appropriate way to utilize the public money. Nevertheless, I agree to this solution only to a certain degree because I feel that giving those with no work a mobile phone each is a total waste of money.In a positive point of view, when people without jobs have hand phones that have access to the Internet, they will be able to browse the net for more job opportunities. For example, they can surf the The Star Onlines' work section to find a job that is suitable for them. With the help of the net, they can also do more research on the work that they have found apart from looking up on how they can prepare themselves for the job. Not only that, the mobile phones can also be used to make calls with the companies in which they would like to work with. In short, if the government provides those without work with a mobile phone, they will be able to find themselves an occupation in order to live and survive.Nonetheless, looking from another perspective, supplying hand phones to the unemployed is a waste of the taxpayers' money. This is because the money instead of being used to supply the electronic gadget can be used for other useful purposes for the country. To illustrate this further, the money can be used to build more amenities for the public or given to the poor so that they can use it to help them earn a living. To conclude, the money can be used for other intentions rather than giving hand phones to the unemployed.Furthermore, when hand phones are provided for free, many would want to take advantage of this opportunity. It will not be surprising that in order to obtain a mobile phone, they make themselves jobless. Some might even go to the extent of lying that they are on unemployment to make them eligible to get the phones. In this context, the public's money is spent worthlessly. On top of that, till now, there are no surveys or evidences that prove this method in effective in reducing the rate of unemployment.To put it in a nutshell, the suggestion of providing those who are jobless with mobile phones that are accessible to internet is not a proper and the best way to trim down the rate of unemployment. I suggest the government look into the background of the people in depth before giving out hand phones to them. I strongly believe that the public money should be utilized for the benefit of the society and not just for some of them who are not willing to put in more effort to find them a proper work.;The proposal to provide every unemployed person with a mobile phone and ensure their access to the Internet has garnered significant attention. While the intent behind this idea is commendable—aiming to assist individuals in their job search and enhance their employability—I remain skeptical about its effectiveness as a stand-alone solution to the multifaceted issue of unemployment.One may argue that access to mobile phones and the Internet can empower the unemployed. In today's digital age, many job applications and communications occur online. Therefore, equipping unemployed individuals with technology could ostensibly facilitate their job-seeking efforts. Furthermore, mobile devices can provide access to online courses, job training programs, and networking platforms, which could help individuals improve their skills and connect with potential employers.However, the core reasons behind unemployment often extend beyond mere access to technology. Factors such as economic conditions, industry shifts, lack of relevant skills, and geographical constraints play a significant role in determining an individual's employability. Thus, while providing mobile phones and Internet access could be a part of a broader strategy to combat unemployment, it would be ineffective without addressing these deeper, underlying issues.Moreover, the financial burden on the government should be carefully considered. Public funds could be used more effectively to support targeted training programs, mental health resources, or financial literacy initiatives that address the varied needs of the unemployed population. By investing in comprehensive programs that enhance skills and address systemic barriers, we could tackle unemployment more holistically.In conclusion, while providing mobile phones and Internet access to unemployed individuals might offer some short-term benefits, it should not be viewed as a panacea for a complex issue. A multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of unemployment is essential for sustainable solutions.
84;The use of close circuit television (CCTV) cameras in streets, stations, shops and other public places has increased rapidly in recent years. Although we are told that these cameras help in the fight against crime, some people are opposed to their use. They believe that everyone has a right to privacy. What are your views?;Today, close circuit television (CCTV) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances. They are used in schools, businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place. It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer, especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise. Nevertheless, some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored. Even so, I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace.Firstly, by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down. This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced. To illustrate this further, in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight. Not only that, as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops. Thus, it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized.Furthermore, at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers. At times, face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger. Hence, the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded. In the event of an argument, the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken. In short, these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers.Looking from another perspective, the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy. Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras. However, one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences. Ergo, opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime.To conclude, CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise. This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers. Admittedly, privacies are lost with the use of these cameras. Nonetheless, safety should be put first in order to be safe.;The surge in the installation of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras across various public venues, including streets, stations, and shops, mirrors a growing societal emphasis on safety and security. Advocates for this technology argue that the presence of CCTV significantly deters criminal activity, assists law enforcement in solving crimes, and enhances overall public safety. Statistical evidence often links increased CCTV usage to reductions in certain crime rates, indicating that surveillance can create a safer environment, especially in urban areas where risk factors are more pronounced.However, this rapid proliferation of cameras raises important concerns regarding privacy rights. Opponents argue that constant surveillance of individuals in public spaces infringes upon personal freedoms and rights to privacy. The fear of being monitored can alter behavior, leading to an atmosphere of mistrust among citizens. Moreover, there are worries regarding the misuse of footage and the potential for unauthorized access to personal data collected by these cameras. Instances of governmental overreach and surveillance abuse, as highlighted by various privacy advocates, underline the delicate balance between security and individual rights.In my view, while the benefits of CCTV in crime deterrence and investigation are substantial, they should not supersede the fundamental rights to privacy that individuals typically expect in a democratic society. A middle ground can be reached by implementing stringent regulations that govern the use of CCTV. This includes clear guidelines about data storage, access controls, and transparency regarding where cameras are installed. Additionally, periodic audits can help ensure that these systems are utilized for their intended purpose – enhancing safety – while still respecting citizens' rights. Ultimately, a thoughtful, balanced approach is essential to reconcile the need for security with the values of privacy and freedom.
85;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city? Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays living is possible on every place of the world, but still there are some differences among them. From my point of view big cities can be a good place for bringing up children.To begin with, it is undeniable that education is better in big cities in comparison with countrysides. For instance, in my country the best schools, universities and institutes are located in cities, and todays education is one of the most important parts of our children's life. Therefore, it is a good idea for children to past their first earlier life in the cities.What is more, it is acknowledged that a large number of creational facilities are built in cities. Children who live in cities have a lot of entertainment. For example playgrounds, parks, science museums, cinemas etc. However, in countrysides we hardly ever see creational facilities. Children who live in countrysides most of the time pass their free time in farms.Finally, in big cities children access to media easily, so they can learn a lot of things by watching television and surfing through the net. Via internet they can have connection with the other children all around the world, therefor they can exchange their knowledge, they can learn different cultures.To sum up, although countrysides have some advantages such as fresh air, peace, and etc. Today's children needs somethings to entertain them, and occupy their leisure time in the best way.;The question of whether it is better for children to grow up in the countryside or in a big city is a topic that elicits diverse opinions. While both environments offer unique advantages, I firmly believe that growing up in the countryside provides children with a more enriching and balanced experience.Firstly, the countryside presents a safer and healthier environment for children. Rural areas typically have lower crime rates and less pollution, allowing children to explore outdoors without the constant worry of urban dangers. The abundance of fresh air and natural surroundings promotes physical activity and encourages children to engage in outdoor play, which is vital for their health and development. Studies have shown that children who spend time in nature exhibit improved mental health and well-being, as well as stronger immune systems.Moreover, growing up in the countryside can foster a stronger connection to nature. Children raised in rural areas often develop an appreciation for the environment and learn the importance of sustainability and conservation. They are more likely to engage with animals and plant life, which can cultivate empathy and responsibility. This connection can instill lifelong values of environmental stewardship, something that is increasingly crucial in today’s context of climate change and ecological degradation.In contrast, while cities may offer greater access to resources such as educational institutions, cultural diversity, and social opportunities, they can also present challenges, such as higher living costs, dense populations, and distractions from academic and personal growth. The constant stimulation of city life can be overwhelming for children, hindering their ability to focus and develop meaningful relationships.In conclusion, while both countryside and urban environments have their merits, I believe that the benefits of growing up in the countryside—such as safety, health, and a connection to nature—far outweigh those found in big cities. By fostering a nurturing and tranquil environment, rural living can contribute significantly to a child's overall development and well-being.
86;Some people prefer to take a position in a company and work for the company. Other people think is better to go into business for themselves. Which do you think is better?;"There are many kinds of jobs in society. Some of them are done by companies that related to government, and some of them are done by privat companies. Although both companies have their advantages and disadvantages, I would prefer to work for myself, and have my own business. There are many benefits when people work for themselves rather than work for the others. In the first place, there are a large number of opportunities in privat works that you cannot find them when you work for the others. In your job you can be boss of yourself; however, in the other jobs someone else are your boss. You always have to be responsible for your task, and it make a stressful situation that I never like it.What is more, when people work for themselves they make more profit for themselves, but in the other jobs you make profits for the other such as your manager. Unfortunately nowadays most of them pick up this profit without sharing a small sum of it with their workers, and from my point of view it is unfair.Finally, there are some authorities in privat jobs that workers are always looking for them while they are working for the others. When you work for yourself you can punch in and punch out whenever you want. Sometimes some occasions happen to people for example a disease, sticking in a traffic jam and sometime going on a vacation. For all of them we have to ask for a permission, and most of the time we are not allowed.There is no doubt that working for the other have some advantages, too, but I imagine people that have their own business are more comfortable. They have more opportunities, profits, and authorities.";The choice between securing a position within a company and pursuing entrepreneurship is a fundamental decision that varies from person to person, shaped by individual preferences, risk tolerance, and career aspirations. Both paths have their merits, but I believe that for most people, taking a position in a company offers a more stable and rewarding career trajectory.Working for a company provides a sense of security that is often unattainable in entrepreneurship. Employees benefit from a steady paycheck, health insurance, retirement plans, and other perks that come with corporate employment. This financial stability allows individuals to plan for the future and invest in their personal lives without the inherent uncertainty associated with running a business. For instance, start-ups often take considerable time to generate profits, leaving entrepreneurs vulnerable to financial strain.Moreover, corporate environments offer opportunities for professional development that can be more challenging to find as an entrepreneur. Companies often invest in their employees through training programs, mentorship, and networking opportunities, enabling individuals to acquire new skills and advance their careers. This collaborative atmosphere fosters strong professional relationships, which can prove valuable in the long run.On the other hand, entrepreneurship can be immensely rewarding for those who have a strong vision and the capability to execute it. The satisfaction of building something from the ground up and experiencing the fruits of one’s labor is undeniably appealing. Nevertheless, the risks are significant. Approximately 20% of small businesses fail within their first year, underscoring the reality that entrepreneurship is fraught with challenges.In conclusion, while both career paths have their own advantages, I believe that for most individuals, working for a company is a better option. The stability, professional growth, and collaborative opportunities provided by corporate employment offer a more secure and enriching experience compared to the unpredictability of running a business.
87;"The expression ""Never,never give up"" means keep trying and never stop working for your goal. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?";"Many individuals throughout their life face with at least one failure in different areas such as education, love and economy. Some believe when a person faces with a failure the best way is to forget that and releases that; however, I completely disagree with this idea. I always believe that a defeated person has to try and try until to achieve her or his goal. First of all, when people face with a failure they can learn a large number of things from that failure, therefore in the next effort they try to avoid doing and repeating that mistakes. For instance, most of inventors in the first phases of their job face with some problems and defeats, but in the next stages they learn how to deal with problems.Second of all, experience shows while people doing a job constantly, they become more experienced in that subject, so in the final effort they become successful with the high percentile. For example, scientists experiment a substance for a long time, after they gain lots of experience and knowledge about that subject they decide to make it final.To sum up, I would maintain that people should not give up when they face with a failure. In opposite, they have to learn new points from that failure, and they become more experienced.";"The expression ""Never, never give up"" embodies a powerful mantra that emphasizes perseverance and resilience in the pursuit of one's goals. I wholeheartedly agree with this statement. In a world rife with challenges and setbacks, the ability to persist in the face of adversity is not just admirable—it is essential for success.One of the quintessential examples of this tenacity can be seen in the stories of numerous innovators and leaders throughout history. Thomas Edison, for instance, famously encountered thousands of failures before successfully inventing the light bulb. His unwavering commitment to his vision illustrates the importance of grit and determination. Without the willingness to ""never give up,"" many groundbreaking inventions, literary masterpieces, and influential movements may never have come into existence. Moreover, the journey to achieving goals is rarely linear. It often involves overcoming obstacles that require adjustments in strategy and mindset. When we encounter difficulties, the most constructive response is to assess the situation critically and remain focused on our aspirations. Giving up not only stifles potential growth but can also lead to missed opportunities for learning and improvement. Each failure presents a chance to gather insights that can better equip us for future endeavors.However, it is crucial to clarify that ""never giving up"" should not equate to stubbornness. There are times when reevaluating one's goals or taking a different path is necessary for personal growth or well-being. The essence of this expression lies in the pursuit of persistence combined with adaptability. Thus, while one should continuously strive towards their goals, it is equally important to remain open to change.In conclusion, the expression ""Never, never give up"" serves as a reminder of the power of perseverance and the importance of maintaining dedication in the face of challenges. Combined with a willingness to learn and evolve, this mindset can pave the path toward success."
88;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree with this point of view?;Nowadays there are some issues which many countries and nations are concern about that. Two of the most important of them are rate of increasing population and endangered plants and animals. From my point of view although endangered animals are important, human needs should be considered more.Firstly, day by day population is increasing, so human needs for food is increasing as well. We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn, and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks. Therefore, farmlands are vital for human life.Secondly, people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals, so they need land to build their houses on it. Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable.Finally, human need some crucial things to continue their life, and most of them are industrial such as medicine. Therefore, some lands should be assigned to industry. Todays life has some difficulty which become comfortable with the help of industry. To conclude, the population of endangered animals are less than people's population, so they do not need so much land that people need. I would maintain that nowadays humans need farmland, housing and industry because of increasing population are more important than saving land for endangered animals.;"The debate between prioritizing human needs for farmland, housing, and industry over the conservation of land for endangered animals is a contentious one and requires a careful examination of both perspectives. While it is imperative to recognize the necessity of land for human development, I believe that the preservation of habitats for endangered species is equally crucial for the sustainability of our ecosystems.Human activities such as agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization have a significant impact on the environment. The demand for farmland to produce food is justified; however, this often leads to deforestation and the destruction of natural habitats, pushing many species to the brink of extinction. The loss of biodiversity can have far-reaching consequences on ecosystems, affecting food chains and the overall health of the environment. For instance, pollinators like bees, which are crucial for food production, are declining due to habitat loss. This indicates that neglecting the needs of endangered species can ultimately undermine human interests.Moreover, the interdependence between humans and wildlife should not be overlooked. Healthy ecosystems provide invaluable services, such as clean air, water purification, and climate regulation. Protecting natural habitats not only saves endangered animals but also secures these essential services for future generations. Furthermore, the preservation of biodiversity can support ecotourism and contribute to local economies, making conservation an economically viable option.In conclusion, while the demands of human development are legitimate, they should not come at the expense of our planet's biodiversity. It is possible to find a balance that allows for sustainable development while protecting endangered species. Prioritizing conservation efforts is not merely an ethical choice; it is a necessity for the health of the environment and the continued prosperity of humanity. Thus, I firmly believe that saving land for endangered animals should be a fundamental consideration in our developmental policies."
89;One should never judge a person by external appearance. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Individuals have two features, one of them is appearance and the other one is personality. From my point of view although appearance is important, personality is the most important. We can never judge about a person with his or her appearance. Some people believes, individuals who have black skin or are frown are not good person and in opposite individuals who have pale or white skin or always have smile on their face are good person. I completely disagree with these kind of judgement which someone makes.First of all, there are people who play a role and cheat the other individuals with their playing, therefore we have to be aware to never judge with their appearance. For example, some people cheat their fiance before marriage by showing a cheerful face and well spoken; however, after getting marriage they show their real personality.Second of all, there are some people who are black skin, fat and frown, nonetheless they might be a great person for leaving and colleague. For instance, I have a neighbor who are old, black skin and frown and I had always panicked of her. One day in a cold winter while I was getting back to home from school I realized that I lost my keys, so I could not do anything before my parents getting back home. She asked me to stay with her till my parents come, also she was great in hospitality and her behavior was unforgettable. After that I understood, I had to never judge with people's appearance.All in all, the best way to judge about individuals' is to be familiar with their personality not with their appearance. Unfortunately, many people play role to cheat the others, and they try to hide their real personality with their appearance.";"The age-old adage ""don’t judge a book by its cover"" resonates deeply with the notion that external appearances can often mislead our perceptions of individuals. I wholeheartedly agree with the statement that one should never judge a person by external appearance, as doing so disregards their inherent complexity and worth.External appearances, whether concerning style, attire, or physical features, often form the first impressions we make of others. However, these superficial traits do not accurately encapsulate an individual's personality, values, or capabilities. For instance, a person may dress in a manner that appears unkempt or disheveled, yet they could possess an extraordinary intellect or a kind heart. Conversely, someone who presents themselves in an impeccably polished manner might harbor prejudices or insecurities that taint their character. Our perception based on appearance can lead to hasty conclusions, resulting in missed opportunities for meaningful connections with those who may not fit societal norms of attractiveness or success.Moreover, various cultures express identity and individuality differently. Judging based on appearances overlooks the diverse backgrounds and stories each individual carries. The superficial markers we commonly associate with success or intelligence are further influenced by societal standards that change over time and often perpetuate stereotypes. This leads to a tunneled vision of humanity, hindering social growth and understanding.In contrast, engaging with individuals beyond their external appearance allows for the discovery of authentic and rich personalities. Taking the time to understand someone's thoughts, experiences, and motivations fosters deeper relationships and promotes inclusivity. It is essential to embrace the idea that everyone carries a unique narrative that deserves respect and acknowledgment.In conclusion, it is imperative to resist the temptation to judge others based on external appearances. By doing so, we open ourselves to a world of potential relationships and understanding that transcends superficial evaluations, enriching our lives and fostering a more harmonious society."
90;Some people believe that there should be a single international language. Others believe that this would make it difficult to maintain the identity of cultures. What's your opinion?;The 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization, which raises people's concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not. From my perspective, a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people.It is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation. As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation. In contrast, without the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them. Therefore, a single international language serves an economic purpose.Also, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions. If people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles. For example, when people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience.In spite of this, the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied. To be more specific, a single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation. This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong. For instance, some Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries, due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English.Therefore, I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication. On the other hand, every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage.;"The debate surrounding the establishment of a single international language presents compelling arguments on both sides, reflecting the complex interplay between communication and cultural identity. Advocates for a universal language argue that it could significantly enhance global communication, reduce misunderstandings, and foster closer international relationships. A common linguistic platform would facilitate travel, trade, and diplomacy, bridging gaps between diverse populations and promoting a sense of unity among nations. In our increasingly interconnected world, the need for an effective means of communication is more vital than ever, and a single language could simplify interactions in education, business, and technology.However, the opposition raises valid concerns about the potential erosion of cultural identity that could accompany the establishment of a dominant global language. Language is more than a communication tool; it encapsulates the history, traditions, and unique perspectives of a culture. The extinction of minority languages and dialects, often a consequence of language homogenization, can lead to the loss of cultural heritage and a diminished diversity of human experience. Languages carry within them stories, humor, values, and worldviews that are intricately tied to the identities of their speakers. Thus, enforcing a single language might risk delegating smaller cultures to the status of relics rather than living, evolving traditions.In my opinion, while the idea of a global language offers significant benefits in terms of efficiency and understanding, it is crucial to preserve linguistic diversity. Rather than enforcing one language for all, we could strive for multilingualism, encouraging individuals to embrace international languages for communication while nurturing their native tongues. This approach not only fosters a sense of global citizenship but also ensures that the rich tapestry of world cultures remains vibrant and intact. In doing so, we can create a more inclusive world where diversity in language contributes to unity rather than division."
91;Fashion trends are difficult to follow these days and it is believed that they primarily just to sell clothes. Some people believe that we should not follow them and that we should dress in what we like. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;With increasing availability to the Internet, people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world, such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year. However, some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends. From my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles.This is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations, which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today. When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world's cutting-edge fashion information, they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world, which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world. In contrast, if they stuck to their own fashion styles, disregarding the world's top fashion designers' achievements, they would stay conservative in their own worlds. As a result, they might fall behind shortly.Furthermore, people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information. Without following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles.Despite this, it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals' personalities. Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends, which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes. Consequently, the world would look monotonous.With those arguments in mind, I would conclude that people should, especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge, care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world's changes. On the other hand, creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas, developing their own fashion styles as they like.;Fashion trends, particularly in today's fast-paced digital world, often fluctuate rapidly, creating an environment where it can be challenging for individuals to keep up. Influences from social media, celebrities, and global events seem to dictate what is 'in' or 'out' on an almost weekly basis. Many people argue that these trends are primarily formulated to drive sales in the fashion industry rather than to genuinely inspire personal style. They claim that this creates a superficial culture that prioritizes consumption over individuality.I find considerable merit in the argument that individuals should dress in what they like rather than adhere blindly to fleeting fashion trends. Personal expression is a fundamental aspect of identity, and clothing serves as a powerful tool for conveying who we are. When individuals consciously choose outfits that resonate with their personal taste, they are more likely to feel confident and authentic. This authenticity often leads to a more meaningful engagement with the world around them, fostering a sense of belonging and self-acceptance. Moreover, the fast fashion model—which encourages constant consumption—raises grave environmental concerns. Many individuals may feel pressured to update their wardrobes frequently, contributing to waste and unsustainable practices in the fashion industry. By resisting the urge to conform to ephemeral trends, people can cultivate a more thoughtful and sustainable approach to fashion, opting for timeless pieces that reflect their unique style.In conclusion, while fashion trends can offer inspiration and variety, prioritizing personal preference over fleeting trends allows individuals to express their identity more genuinely. Embracing what we truly like, rather than succumbing to external pressures, enables us to foster a fashion sense that is both authentic and sustainable.
92;Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth among poorer nations by providing such things as food and education? Or is it the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens themselves?;"Whether wealthy nations should take responsibilities to help poorer ones, by means of providing infrastructures, or remain bystander of the global poverty, is an issue of controversy. Personally I think, as the privileged minority, wealthy nations have every reason to share their fortune with the poor.In terms of ethics, it is inhumane to watch one's fellowman struggle against famine and poverty without doing anything to help, especially when the onlooker takes no effort to do so. Compassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals.Economically speaking, such aid could also create a win-win situation. Underdeveloped nations no doubt receive direct benefits through such deeds. For developed nations, new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem, promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry. The potential market in those poor countries, most of which has a huge population, is also a thing worth mentioning. By building a good relationship with them, wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market, but also facilitate future international commerce. The underdeveloped nations, in return, may export local agricultural products, mineral products with discount to the former, boosting each other's economy.In summary, wealthy nations' offering in need is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways. Only those who sympathize with their fellowman can prosper in the long run.";The issue of wealth distribution between wealthy and poorer nations remains a contentious topic in global discussions on justice and equity. Advocates of the idea that affluent countries should share their wealth argue that historical injustices, economic disparities, and global interdependence necessitate a moral obligation to assist poorer nations. Wealthy nations, often benefitting from colonial histories and exploitative trade practices, hold a significant responsibility to address the resultant inequalities that plague developing countries. By providing essentials such as food and education, these nations can contribute to sustainable development, fostering not only immediate relief but also long-term growth and stability.On the other hand, the standpoint that the governments of poorer nations should be primarily responsible for their citizens raises important considerations. Sovereignty and self-determination are core principles that underpin the governance of nations. It is crucial for these governments to harness their resources and capabilities to improve the lives of their citizens rather than relying heavily on foreign aid. This approach encourages accountability and fosters a culture of resilience and innovation within poorer nations. Moreover, it is conceivable that assistance from wealthier countries can inadvertently lead to dependency, undermining local governance and diminishing the impetus for self-sufficiency.In conclusion, while it is imperative for wealthier nations to assist poorer nations in addressing critical issues like hunger and educational deprivation, the ultimate responsibility intertwines with the capability and commitment of the governments in these developing nations. A balanced approach, promoting equitable partnerships that empower local communities while recognizing the historical and ongoing impacts of wealth disparity, may serve as the most effective way to foster global progress. Only through collaboration can both wealthier and poorer nations work towards a more just and equitable world.
93;Out of our country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spend on health education and preventative measures.ÊTo what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It is a completely right and extremely wise policy to focus on health education and preventative measures rather than treatment. Once applied, it will bring many benefits to both citizens and governments.Health education causes long-term positive effects on our next generations. First of all, thank to a full health education from their childhoods, children will have good habits of taking care of their own health and these habits may be kept in their adolescences. For example, if a child is educated to have a hygienic lifestyle at a very young age, he also keeps it when older. Secondly, health education will prepare for people especially children necessary knowledge to protect themselves from risks of diseases. Instead of afraid or panic, they may be calmer if unfortunately committing some normal diseases such as allergy or illness in seasonal changes. Many diseases which may be cured easily can turn to serious ones if we do not have right treatment. Health education will help people to have right choices of treatment to recover more quickly.Preventative measures will help improve general health state of all citizens. For example, vaccines will guarantee that pregnant women and their babies are protected from serious infectious diseases such as flu, smallpox, rubella so on. When huge injection campaigns are organized throughout our country, the community's health state will be improved remarkably. As human resources play a key role in the development of a country, investing money to enhance the general health state is a totally right decision. In addition, because the cost of treatment is often much higher than that of prevention, the government can save a lot of money for our country's health budget.In conclusion, I strongly agree that we should give more priority to health education and preventative measures than to treatment. However, reasonable attentions should be paid to treatment so that our citizens are always looked after with best services.;The allocation of a country's health budget has long been a subject of debate among policymakers, health professionals, and the public. The statement suggesting that a large proportion of health funding should be diverted from treatment to focus on health education and preventative measures merits serious consideration. I largely agree with this perspective for several reasons.Firstly, investing in health education and preventative measures can significantly reduce the incidence of preventable diseases. Education plays a crucial role in informing the public about healthy lifestyle choices, such as balanced nutrition, physical activity, and the dangers of tobacco and excessive alcohol use. By raising awareness, individuals are more likely to adopt healthier behaviors, which can decrease the prevalence of chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Over time, this could lead to a notable reduction in the demand for expensive medical treatments and hospitalizations.Secondly, preventative healthcare often entails lower costs in the long run. Treating chronic illnesses can be incredibly costly, both for individuals and for the healthcare system as a whole. By reallocating funds towards preventative programs and health education initiatives, we not only empower individuals to take charge of their health but also relieve the financial burden on healthcare services. Fewer resources spent on treatment can create a more sustainable healthcare system, allowing for better funding of essential services and interventions.However, it is important to acknowledge that a balanced approach is vital. While preventative measures are essential, completely diverting funds from treatment could leave vulnerable populations without necessary care. Therefore, a careful reassessment of resource allocation is needed rather than a wholesale diversion.In conclusion, while a significant emphasis on health education and preventative measures is crucial for improving public health outcomes, it should be pursued in conjunction with maintaining adequate treatment services. By adopting a more integrated approach, we can foster a healthier population, mitigate healthcare costs, and ultimately enhance the overall well-being of society.
94;The popularity of news media often has significant influence on people' lives. Some people believe that to be a negative development. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays news media have become more and more popular. Many people consider that the drawbacks of this phenomenon outweigh its merits. However, it is possible that this idea is not completely true. It is widely seen that news media not only brings people entertainment, but also polishes up people' knowledge. Therefore, it seems not unreasonable to suggest that this is a positive development.First and foremost, today entertainment is easier for people to enjoy than ever before. The fact is that such news media as televisions, radios, or newspapers are bringing many news on entertainment sector from all over the world to everybody. People can sit in front of their televisions and watch whatever they want, from musical concerts to live football match. This is a convenient way of relaxation after hard work. Obviously, the popularity of news media is beneficial to human beings.In addition to this, news media help people broaden their knowledge. It is clearly seen that mass media provide people with a variety of global news on all fields, including political situation, economic change, global warming, and so forth. Hence, there is a strong likelihood that today people are able to know the world better. This is particularly essential when the globalization process has been permeating into all areas of society. Indeed, the fast growth of news media is helpful for people worldwide.In conclusion, the development of news media has been making great inroads into the lives of all people. It relaxes people with plentiful entertainment news. It enriches people's knowledge with worldwide information. It also positively affects the way people live in many other aspects. Therefore, the progress of news media is an advantageous development.;The popularity of news media has become a defining feature of modern society, influencing cultures, economies, and individual lives in profound ways. However, this influence is often debated, with some arguing that it constitutes a negative development due to the potential for misinformation, sensationalism, and a lack of objectivity. I tend to agree with the notion that the consequences of such popularity can be detrimental.One of the primary issues arising from the widespread consumption of news media is the prevalence of misinformation. In the race for clicks and views, various platforms prioritize sensational storytelling over fact-based reporting. This phenomenon not only distorts public perception but also fosters a climate of distrust among citizens. As a result, individuals often find themselves navigating a maze of conflicting narratives, making it increasingly difficult to discern fact from fiction. This has dangerous implications, particularly in contexts such as elections or public health crises, where informed decision-making is crucial.Moreover, the emphasis on sensationalism can lead to desensitization. Continuous exposure to alarming news can create a sense of anxiety and helplessness, prompting a disconnect from reality. People may become so overwhelmed by the barrage of negative stories that they disengage from civic duties or community involvement, believing that their actions cannot effect change. This not only impacts individual mental health but can also contribute to a wider societal apathy toward pressing issues.In conclusion, while news media serves the vital role of informing the public and acting as a check on power, its popularity often manifests in ways that can be harmful. Misinformation and sensationalism are pervasive challenges that diminish the quality of public discourse and hinder meaningful engagement. Therefore, I believe that the overall impact of the popularity of news media can be viewed as a negative development that necessitates critical examination and reform.
95;Under British and Australian laws, a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?Ê;It is a well known fact that a jury involved in a case has no information regarding the criminal's past illegal acts under the British and Australian laws. There are few of those who are concerned think the current practice should be altered and that the juries should at least know something about the criminals before coming to a conclusion. I, for one, agree to this resolution whole-heartedly as it poses advantages to various parties as I shall discuss below.First and foremost, I believe that it would be easier for the juries to make a decision if they know about the past information about the criminal. This is because, knowing their background very well will enable the juries to analyze the crime before coming up with a judgment. For instance, take a person who has not murdered anyone but is suddenly found to be guilty. The juries will be able to know weather the individual committed the crime intentionally or due to circumstances by knowing the facts about the person. Then, punishment can be given in accordance to the condition.Apart from that, a fair trial can be achieved. As all of us know, juries are a group of people who have no or less knowledge regarding law. Thus, exposing them to the past records of the criminal can give them more room to think rationally and finally put the pieces together in order to produce a more meaningful decision. By doing so, the juries will have a sense of relief that they have come up with better conclusion based on plenty of evidences. Not only that, the convicted will also receive a fair action.It is undeniable that when the background of the convicted is 'dug' deeper and is revealed to mass of anonymous people, his privacy is being jeopardized. If finally he is proven innocent, he may feel embarrassed to face the public. However, I am sure that the crimes done by criminals should be brought to light and the public should be aware of it so that they will not become a victim as well.To conclude, I definitely feel that the current way of the juries judging the case should be transformed and they should know the facts about the criminals they are dealing with. This is of paramount importance so that they will be able to give a better and reliable as well as a fair judgment to the convicted. Beneficial changes will certainly take place if changes are made because for a change to happen, changes have to be done.;"The practice of withholding an accused individual's past criminal record from a jury is a cornerstone of the justice system in both the UK and Australia. This principle is founded on the belief that every defendant is entitled to a fair trial, free from bias stemming from previous infractions. The notion of “presumption of innocence” reinforces this, meaning an individual should be considered innocent until proven guilty, based solely on the evidence presented in the current case.Proponents of allowing juries access to prior criminal records argue that such information could provide context about the defendant's character and potential propensity for the alleged crime. They contend that prior convictions might be relevant in assessing the likelihood of reoffending, particularly in cases involving repeat offenders. However, this perspective fails to recognize the inherent risks associated with introducing past records into a trial.Access to prior criminal records could significantly bias jury members, leading them to make decisions driven by preconceived notions of guilt based on past behavior rather than the merits of the current case. Human psychology plays a crucial role here; jurors might unconsciously associate previous criminality with a higher likelihood of guilt, undermining the core tenets of impartiality and fairness that a trial demands. Such bias could disproportionately damage the prospects for a fair judicial outcome, which would contravene the very ideals of justice that the legal systems strive to uphold.In conclusion, while the intention behind allowing juries access to past criminal records might stem from a desire to ensure informed decision-making, the potential for bias and unfair prejudice significantly outweighs any purported benefits. Upholding the integrity of the presumption of innocence and ensuring fair treatment for all defendants should remain a paramount objective of the justice system."
96;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Whenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place, it attracts millions of people all over the world. As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border, popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely.First and foremost, sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results, break records and bring victories to their own countries. Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events, there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures. Consequently, sport events with the spirit of healthiness, honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding, friendship and solidarity among nations. After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition, the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners, which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations.Secondly, sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators. Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete. The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country. When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness. For instance, when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets. People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President. The eager atmosphere lasted many next days. In fact, some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally. However, the hooligans only took a minority of people. Therefore, it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen.In conclusion, international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely. Hence, I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future.;"International sporting events, particularly prestigious competitions like the football World Cup, often serve as platforms for countries to come together in a spirit of camaraderie and competition. These events are not merely games; they are cultural phenomena that can ease international tensions and provide a channel for expression of patriotic emotions in a constructive manner. I largely agree with the assertion that such occasions play a significant role in promoting peace and unity.Firstly, international sporting events foster a sense of global community. People from various nations gather to celebrate their teams, creating an atmosphere of mutual respect and enthusiasm. This collective experience can often override individual nationalistic sentiments, allowing for shared joy and camaraderie among rival fans. Events like the World Cup demonstrate that, despite political differences, the love for sport can bridge gaps and foster understanding. For instance, during the 2018 World Cup, even fans from adversarial nations united in their love for the game, showcasing a rare moment of solidarity.Moreover, these events often prompt international collaborations and exchanges. Countries invest in infrastructure, tourism, and diplomacy surrounding these occasions, which can lead to improved relations. The hosting of the Olympics, for instance, is not only a showcase of athletic prowess but also an opportunity for cultural exchange and dialogue between nations.However, it is essential to recognize the limitations of sports as a tool for alleviating international tensions. While sports can unite, they can also spark rivalries that lead to unrest. Instances of violence between fans, or politically charged protests, can overshadow the spirit of competition. Thus, while sporting events have the potential to ease tensions, they can also be co-opted for less constructive purposes.In conclusion, while international sporting events like the football World Cup can indeed ease tensions and channel patriotic fervor in a positive direction, it is crucial to acknowledge that they are not a panacea for global discord. Ultimately, they provide an opportunity for nations to interact and understand one another better, but the accompanying challenges must also be addressed."
97;In many countries, children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard as completely wrong, while others consider it as some kind of work experience, important for learning and taking responsibilities.ÊWhat are your opinions on this?;In many countries, children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions. Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities. However, some people think it's not a good educational measure. From my point of view, the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks.First of all, children can learn about the hardship of earning money. When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies, doing housework and keeping shops, they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life. Therefore, they are likely to understand their parents' hardship, to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving.Secondly, when children take jobs, they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working. To keep their jobs, children will have to try their best to finish their duties. For example, if a child works as a shop assistant, he will have to keep an eye on good and products, calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost.Some people may argue that children will be more material, neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers. However, if children get good care and instructions from their parents, they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way.In conclusion, if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents' permission, they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible. I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children 's study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children's labour.;"The issue of child labor is complex and often stirs considerable debate. On one side of the argument, critics vehemently oppose any form of paid work for children, believing it infringes on their rights to childhood, education, and leisure. They argue that children should be in school, not in workplaces, where they may face exploitation and harsh conditions. The detrimental impacts on physical health, mental well-being, and academic achievement are clear and alarming. Research consistently shows that children engaged in labor often sacrifice their education, which can perpetuate cycles of poverty and limit future opportunities.Conversely, some proponents argue that working can offer children invaluable life skills, instilling a sense of responsibility, time management, and financial literacy. In many developing countries, where economic conditions are challenging, working can be a necessity for families. Participation in the workforce can provide children with a sense of contribution and purpose, fostering independence and resilience. When regulated and aligned with educational commitments, such work experiences may serve as a bridge to personal and professional development.In evaluating both perspectives, it becomes evident that while there may be benefits to work experience, the context is crucial. Any form of child labor must be closely monitored to ensure that it does not come at the expense of education or well-being. Additionally, initiatives supporting children should prioritize their rights, providing them with opportunities for safe, enriching experiences that promote growth without compromising their childhoods.In conclusion, the notion of children engaging in paid work is neither inherently right nor wrong; rather, it hinges on a delicate balance of factors including the type of work, the working conditions, and the impact on their education and overall development. Ensuring that children have access to safe, meaningful work experiences, while safeguarding their rights to education and leisure, remains the key to addressing this multifaceted issue."
98;In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.;Nowadays, it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies. It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students. Students take a break of year or two, some students travel all around the world during this time, and some choose to take up a job.Experience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people and even at job goes long way. It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent. Student's who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies. This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life. They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses.Taking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts. Once student's starts earning, they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence. They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment. There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education. Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education, which will help them to get a better job and salaries. This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs, one needs a proper and higher qualification.In my view point, I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education. Students who take break, gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working. They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature.;In recent years, an increasing number of countries have adopted the practice of encouraging young people to take a gap year—whether through work or travel—between finishing high school and beginning university studies. This trend presents both advantages and disadvantages, shaping the perspectives, skills, and futures of young individuals.One of the primary advantages of taking a gap year is the opportunity for personal growth. Young people can gain valuable life experiences, develop independence, and build resilience as they navigate new environments and challenges. Working during this time can foster essential skills, such as financial literacy and professional competencies, while travel exposes them to diverse cultures and global perspectives, promoting open-mindedness. Additionally, these experiences can enhance their resumes, making them stand out to future employers and educational institutions.Moreover, a gap year can provide young people with the time and space to reflect on their passions and academic interests. With the pressure of academic performance behind them, they can explore various fields, leading to a more informed choice of university studies. This exploration can lead to increased motivation and commitment once they begin their formal education.On the flip side, there are disadvantages associated with taking a gap year. One such concern is the potential for a lack of structure and focus, leading to a decrease in academic momentum. Students may find it challenging to transition back into the rigorous demands of university after a year of relative independence. Additionally, financial barriers can limit access to travel or work opportunities, disproportionately affecting those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. This can exacerbate inequalities rather than alleviate them.In conclusion, while the option of a gap year presents significant opportunities for personal and educational growth, it is essential to consider the potential drawbacks. Young individuals must weigh these factors carefully to make an informed decision that aligns with their long-term goals and aspirations.
99;The qualities a person needs to become successful in today's world cannot be learned at a university or similar academic institution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's modern and competitive society, it is undeniable that we must equip ourselves with plenty of knowledge and skills in order to shine and to be successful in life. Many opine that the aforementioned aspects are mostly obtained through learning in academic institutions. I do agree to that opinion to a certain degree. Nevertheless, I feel that one can also shine without even having to attend universities.First and foremost, it is certainly true that university education is of paramount importance for certain professions such as doctor, engineer and lawyer. Without proper training and knowledge, it would be impossible for them to perform their best in their careers. Not only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners. This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals.Looking from another perspective, there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university. Take for instance those who start their own business. These people depend solely on hard work and luck. Interestingly, for some of them it proved to be a profitable job. To cite an example, Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19. Initially, he started his computer company in his college dorm room. Eventually, he used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now.In addition, people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life. This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports. The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph. To illustrate this further, David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many. Hence, it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful.To wrap it all up, it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper. However, it would be wrong to say that one's success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions. Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress.;In today's rapidly evolving world, the notion of success transcends traditional academic achievement. While universities and similar academic institutions provide essential knowledge and foundational skills, the qualities that engender true success often go beyond the confines of formal education. I partially agree with the assertion that success in contemporary society cannot be solely cultivated through academia.Firstly, traits such as resilience, adaptability, and emotional intelligence are crucial for navigating the complex challenges of the modern world. These qualities often develop through real-world experiences rather than classroom lectures. For instance, the ability to adapt to new technologies and shifting job markets requires a mindset that embraces change—something that is typically honed through practical involvement in diverse situations rather than theoretical instruction.Moreover, critical thinking and interpersonal skills are integral to success in today's collaborative environments. While academic programs often promote critical analysis, the refinement of interpersonal communication and teamwork skills frequently occurs in real-life scenarios. Engaging in extracurricular activities, internships, or volunteering can nurture these essential abilities, offering lessons that traditional curricula might overlook.However, it is important not to undervalue academic institutions. They lay the groundwork for knowledge and cognitive skills critical to professional success. Fields like engineering, medicine, and law are predicated on extensive education, with universities serving as training grounds for future professionals. Thus, while certain essential qualities for success may be developed outside the classroom, a robust academic foundation remains vital in many career paths.In conclusion, I believe that while universities provide invaluable knowledge and skills, the personal qualities necessary for success in today's world are often cultivated through life experiences, practical challenges, and interpersonal interactions. Success is a multifaceted concept that benefits from both academic achievement and the intangible qualities developed beyond the classroom.
100;People should be allowed to continue to work for as long as they want to, and not forced to retire at a particular age such as 60 or 65. Do you agree or disagree?Ê;The appropriate age at which a person should stop working is now a much debated issue in the society. Some opine that people should be given the option to choose when they want to call it a day while others oppose this notion. In my personal point of view, the right age for a person to retire should be around 60 years old. I, for one, strongly agree that age should be set as a criterion for people to retire at the aforementioned age due to several reasons that I shall discuss below.First and foremost, if senior workers dominate the working sector, there will be lesser job opportunities for the fresh graduates. As a result, most of them will be forced to take up careers which are poles apart from what they had studied for. To illustrate this further, a medical graduate might find it very disheartened when he had to spend around five precious years studying medicine and at the end of the day, he will have to take up another profession rather than doctor due to the insufficient job opportunities available. On top of that, due to the lack of genuine passion on the work which was not of their option, there is a greater possibility for their performance standard to dwindle at their workplace.Apart from that, not all elderly workers are physically well. Beyond that age, a large proportion of them have an elevated chance of contracting a multitude of health problems such as stress related diseases and cardiovascular illnesses. To cite an example, the stressful life that an aged teacher goes through will definitely take a toll on him. Consequently, they will not be able to give their best in whatever they are doing. Besides, the academic institution will have to pay for his medical bills, resulting in more loss for the institution. Thus, it would indeed be better if at an older age, opportunities are given to the younger ones.Admittedly, the expertise of the senior workers who had retired should never be underestimated. Their invaluable experiences and knowledge in their respective fields such as engineering, medicine, and law can certainly be beneficial to the younger generation. Hence, it is highly recommended that the retiree come over to the companies or hospitals to have regular sessions with the present staffs to bridge the gap between them and to pass on their knowledge.In conclusion, it is indeed evident that age limit should be set for retirement. There will come a certain time when the older generation should hand over the responsibility to the fresh comers who are certainly waiting to be given a choice to prove themselves. After all, retirement not only marks the end of an individual, but also gives him a chance to make up for what he has lost throughout his working life.;The question of whether individuals should be allowed to work for as long as they desire, without being compelled to retire at a certain age, such as 60 or 65, raises important issues regarding personal freedom, the evolving nature of work, and the value of experience in the workforce. I strongly agree with the notion that individuals should have the autonomy to determine their own retirement age.Firstly, allowing people to work as long as they wish recognizes their right to choose how to spend their lives. Mandatory retirement ages can be seen as a form of age discrimination, undermining the capabilities and contributions of older workers. Many individuals find fulfillment and purpose in their careers, and forcing them to retire can lead to feelings of boredom, loss of identity, and diminished mental well-being. The right to continue working empowers individuals to maintain their relevance and to pursue their passions on their terms.Additionally, the nature of work has transformed significantly over the years. Advances in technology and changes in workplace dynamics have made it possible for older workers to remain productive and competitive well beyond traditional retirement ages. Many industries are in dire need of experienced professionals who can mentor younger employees, infuse institutional knowledge, and drive innovation. By extending their working years, older adults can enhance not only their own lives but also the organizations they serve.Moreover, as life expectancy continues to rise, the arbitrary age for retirement becomes less sensible. Many individuals in their 60s and beyond are healthy, active, and eager to contribute to society. To impose restrictions based solely on age is both unreasonable and unfair.In conclusion, people should be allowed to work for as long as they want. This policy would respect individual autonomy, leverage the valuable experience of older workers, and adapt to the realities of modern life. Embracing a flexible approach to retirement can promote a more inclusive and productive workforce for all.
101;Some people claim that public museums and art galleries will not be needed because people can see historical objects and works by using computer. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"I believe public museums and art galleries will still be necessary, even though we can see the art works and historical objects online.Most people nowadays prefer to use the Internet to search for art work because the Internet really brings them convenience. We can browse the art work from all over the world at home. However, people may not get a spiritual experience since pictures online are only limited to a screen size. By contrast, the exhibits in museums or galleries are all life size and visitors can get a more direct felling. For example, only when we see the real mummy, can we experience mystique.In order to help visitors to learn more about the exhibits, museums hold various activities which make visitors be part of what they are seeing. For example, at American Museum of Natural History, you can make a bone-by-bone reproduction of the museum's stegosaurus; at Museum of Art in New York, you can look at 17th century instruments while listening to their music. While if you ""visit"" the museum online, you may not able to get this kind of experience.Seeing an art work on computer screen is not the same as you watch it by your own eyes. For instance, you can't see the texture of the artwork which is very important to study the skills used by the artist. What's more, not all the details of the artwork can be shown on the computer screen. Some details might be dim since the resolution ratio of the screen is not high enough. These may influence the comprehension of the art work or historical objects.In conclusion, I believe we still need museums and art galleries but computers can be introduced to museums and galleries in order to help visitors to know more about the art works or historical objects.";"The debate surrounding the relevance of public museums and art galleries in an increasingly digital world raises several pertinent points. While it is true that advancements in technology allow individuals to view historical objects and artworks online, I contend that physical museums and galleries remain essential for cultural and educational experiences.Firstly, virtual exhibitions, while convenient, cannot replicate the sensory experience that comes from observing art and artifacts in person. The palpable presence of a painting, the texture of a sculpture, or the scale of an ancient artifact can only be truly appreciated when experienced firsthand. For instance, standing in front of a Van Gogh painting like ""Starry Night"" offers a profound emotional connection that a digital image cannot convey. Museums provide an environment that fosters reflection and contemplation, allowing visitors to engage with art in a meaningful way.Moreover, museums serve as communal spaces that promote social interaction and cultural discourse. They bring together diverse audiences, enabling shared experiences and discussions that enrich understanding and appreciation of art and history. Physical spaces play a crucial role in fostering a sense of community and belonging, which online platforms cannot emulate. Educational programs and guided tours further enhance visitors' learning experiences, offering insights that deepen their appreciation of the exhibits.Additionally, public museums and galleries are vital for preserving cultural heritage. Many historical artifacts are sensitive to light and environmental conditions, which can deteriorate their condition over time. They must be stored and displayed appropriately in controlled environments that digital platforms cannot provide. The role of museums as custodians of our collective history is irreplaceable, ensuring that future generations can appreciate and learn from our past.In conclusion, while digital platforms have expanded accessibility to art and history, they cannot fully replace the profound experiences garnered from visiting public museums and art galleries. These institutions remain vital for cultural preservation, community engagement, and providing rich, immersive experiences that contribute to our collective understanding of human creativity and history."
102;Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime. Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case. Do you agree or disagree?;Courts of many countries provide a jury with the history of a defendant, except those of the UK and Australia. Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries.Many people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions, which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury. We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant's personality. Furthermore, past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes, such as kidnapping or a murder.Nevertheless, in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience, the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only. For instance, a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record. Innocent suspects, eventually, can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions.In conclusion, I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant's history to the jury, with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict. Thus, I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia, and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions.;"In both British and Australian legal systems, the principle that a jury should not have access to a defendant's past criminal record is pivotal to ensuring a fair trial. This practice seeks to uphold the presumption of innocence, a fundamental tenet of justice, whereby an individual is considered innocent until proven guilty. Allowing juries to access past convictions could severely compromise this principle, leading to bias and prejudice in their deliberations.First, the introduction of prior criminal records may skew a jury's perception of the defendant, clouding their judgment with preconceived notions of guilt based on past behavior. Jurors may unconsciously associate prior offenses with the current charge, leading to an unfair trial that focuses on historical misdeeds rather than the facts of the case at hand. This situation undermines the integrity of the judicial process, as the jury's decision should rest solely on the merits of the evidence presented in the specific case.Furthermore, the justice system aims to rehabilitate offenders. By maintaining the separation of past records from current trials, there is a greater incentive for individuals to seek rehabilitation and make positive changes in their lives without the fear that their past will permanently define them. A holistic, rehabilitative approach aligns more closely with societal values of forgiveness and second chances, fostering a system that encourages transformation rather than simply punishment.In conclusion, the existing practice of excluding past criminal records from jury consideration is essential for preserving the fairness of trials. It prevents bias, upholds the presumption of innocence, and supports the rehabilitative ethos of the justice system. Any shift towards including past convictions would likely erode these principles and compromise the overall integrity of legal proceedings. Therefore, I firmly disagree with the suggestion to change this practice; it is fundamental to ensuring that justice is served accurately and equitably."
103;University lecturers are now able to put their lectures on the internet for students to read and so the importance of attending face to face lectures has been reduced. Do you believe the use of Internet in formal education is a good idea and what are the effects that the internet has on future academic study?Ê;Over the past few decades, the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization, especially in field of education. This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students. Consequently, direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized. However, the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists. Personally, I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning.First and foremost, the Internet is an adequate source of academic information, which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils. Nowadays, not only are lectures available online, it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace. As such, the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever. Moreover, with the use of the Internet, distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance. College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries. Last but not least, the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying. While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes, Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query.In the near future, the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, for the enormous benefits that it brings about. Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously? This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances.Critics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively, for instance internet abuse and black webs. However, we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself. Thus, what we are to do is a change in learners' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study.After analyzing both points of view, I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process. It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages. However, it is not just the matter of help or hindrance, it is the way you use the cyberspace. Be wise and conscious.;The advent of the Internet has transformed the landscape of formal education, particularly with the ability for university lecturers to upload their lectures online. This shift has prompted a debate about the necessity of attending face-to-face lectures, with opinions divided on its implications for students and the future of academic study.I believe that the use of the Internet in formal education is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it offers unprecedented access to educational resources, allowing students to revisit course materials at their convenience. This flexibility accommodates various learning styles and paces, benefiting those who might struggle with traditional learning environments. Furthermore, it has the potential to democratize education, enabling individuals from diverse backgrounds to gain access to the same quality of information regardless of geographical constraints.However, the decline in the importance of face-to-face lectures raises concerns. Personal interaction with lecturers and peers fosters a sense of community that is essential for holistic learning. Face-to-face engagements encourage discussions, critical thinking, and immediate feedback, which are often lacking in online formats. Additionally, attending lectures cultivates essential communication skills and networking opportunities that can be crucial in a student’s professional development.The effects of the Internet on future academic study are profound. While it streamlines the dissemination of information and resources, it also presents the challenge of maintaining student engagement and motivation. As online platforms become more prevalent, institutions will need to find innovative ways to integrate both online and in-person learning experiences to ensure that the educational process remains dynamic and effective.In conclusion, while the Internet enhances access to education, it should not replace the invaluable experiences offered by face-to-face lectures. A balanced approach that combines the benefits of online resources with the enriching environment of traditional classrooms is essential for nurturing the next generation of learners.
104;Many people in the undeveloped world die from diseases that are curable because they can't afford the medication to treat themselves. Do you believe that drug companies in the developed world should be obliged to make their products available at reduced prices in these undeveloped countries so that people do not die unnecessarily?;At present, a large number of patients in poor countries are suffering from deaths caused by lack of medication rather than dangerous diseases. It is suggested that companies in developed countries ought to reduce their price of medicines to avoid such unnecessary deaths.Admittedly, more lives will be saved by the use of effective medicines. The medical industry in developing countries is incapable of producing high-quality drugs. With advanced technology, the developed world has achieved remarkable breakthroughs in making medicines, which can cure a variety of serious illnesses. If people in poorer countries gain access to these drugs, their health situations may be better. The reduction in cost of medicines therefore shows the sign of humanity.However, the current cost of medicines is , in fact, reasonable and based on the medicines' effectiveness. Apparently, the process of researching, testing and producing drugs in masses costs a substantial amount of money. Moreover, these products prove to ensure human health completely. Suppose companies were forced to reduce the cost of drugs, they would make no profit, even running up debt because of production expenditure. Therefore, the measure cannot be adopted, otherwise those companies will go into liquidation. In short, this is not a long-term solution.Fortunately, there are other measures to improve the situation. It is advisable for the government to encourage medical production by supplying land for building factories and reducing part of the taxes. Additionally, charitable organizations can buy medicines from developed countries and distribute to the undeveloped world for free.In conclusion, I disagree with reducing the cost of medicines, which may exacerbate their qualities. Instead, the government and medical foundations should be responsible for the distribution of drugs to the undeveloped world at a more reasonable price.;The moral imperative for pharmaceutical companies in developed nations to provide affordable medication to those in undeveloped countries is an urgent and pressing issue. Every year, millions succumb to diseases that could otherwise be treated easily and effectively. The stark reality is that in many impoverished regions, a lack of access to essential medicines often results in preventable deaths, highlighting a glaring inequity in global health.Pharmaceutical companies, driven primarily by profit motives, have the capacity to develop groundbreaking drugs and life-saving therapies. However, the exorbitant prices attached to these innovations often place them beyond the reach of those who need them most, particularly in developing countries where average incomes are substantially lower. The ethical question arises: should profit take precedence over human life? I firmly believe that these companies have a moral obligation to ensure that their products are accessible to all, regardless of geographical or economic barriers.One possible solution could involve a tiered pricing system that adjusts the cost of medications based on the economic status of a country. This would not only allow drug manufacturers to sustain their profit margins but also provide affordable access to those who need it most. Additionally, creating partnerships with international organizations and NGOs could facilitate the distribution of medicines at reduced prices, ensuring that they reach the populations most affected by curable diseases.Moreover, investing in local pharmaceutical production in undeveloped countries can foster economic growth while providing essential medications. Drug companies should thus recognize their capacity for social responsibility and take active steps towards bridging the accessibility gap in global health. Failure to act is tantamount to condoning the needless loss of life, a prospect that should be wholly unacceptable in a world capable of innovation and compassion.
105;Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree?;The awareness on harmful effects from smoking among the general public has put much pressure on the government and private sectors. As a result, some businesses prohibit smoking in their premises and even some governments restrict smoking in public area. It is agreed that the move will do more good by looking at the quality of health and image of a nation in long run.Firstly, it is well known and clinically proven that smoking is extremely hazardous to the smoker and others who have been exposed to the fume over a period of time. Recent death statistic released by the Malaysian Ministry of Health shows that the top killer was lung related diseases caused by smoking. A large proportion of death involved second hand smoker particularly young children and pregnant women who were vulnerable to these lethal diseases. Therefore, the number of fatality can be significantly reduced if a total ban on public smoking is implemented.Secondly, the image of a healthy nation can be promoted when government restricts public smoking by imposing stern penalty to the offender. For instance, the Brunei government had recently enforced a law against smoking in public areas such as cafés, hospital and shopping street. This step has curbed down the numbers of smokers in the country and as a result, Brunei remains a place known for its tranquility and cleanliness. This example shows the benefit of restricting public smoking to a country as a whole.To sum up, the effort to prohibit people from smoking in public area is certainly helping in curtailing the associated health risks and to create a healthy nation. It is hoped that more businesses and governments will follow the same initiatives for the interest of the people and the country.;The issue of smoking in public and private spaces has become a pivotal topic, eliciting strong opinions from various stakeholders. In recent years, several businesses have adopted no-smoking policies in their offices, and numerous governments have enforced bans on smoking in public places. I firmly agree with these measures, as they contribute to healthier environments and foster a culture of wellness.Firstly, prohibiting smoking in offices significantly enhances the work environment. Exposure to secondhand smoke poses serious health risks, including respiratory issues, heart disease, and various types of cancer. By enforcing no-smoking policies, businesses not only protect the health of their employees but also create a more productive workplace. Studies have shown that healthier employees are typically more focused and engaged, leading to increased job satisfaction and productivity. Furthermore, modern workplaces are increasingly becoming smoke-free zones, aligning with societal shifts towards healthier lifestyles.In addition to workplace policies, government-imposed bans on smoking in public places serve a crucial role in safeguarding public health. Such policies reduce secondhand smoke exposure for non-smokers, particularly vulnerable populations such as children and those with pre-existing health conditions. Public spaces, such as parks, restaurants, and public transportation, become more welcoming and enjoyable for all individuals. As societal attitudes toward smoking continue to evolve, supporting these bans is essential for promoting a healthier community.Moreover, smoking bans encourage smokers to reconsider their habits. With limited spaces available for smoking, individuals may be prompted to quit or reduce their smoking altogether, leading to longer-term health benefits. Public health campaigns advocating against smoking have shown positive results in decreasing smoking rates—an objective that directly correlates with smoke-free policies.In conclusion, the prohibition of smoking in workplaces and public areas is a necessary step towards fostering healthier communities. By prioritizing the health of employees and the public, we not only create better environments but also pave the way for a society that values wellness and reduces the stigmas surrounding smoking.
106;Some people say we humans are harming the Earth through our activities, but other people say we are improving the quality of life on our planet. Which opinion do you agree with ?;"""Save the planet Earth"" is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world. There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments. Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable, but concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons.Firstly, rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world. The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life. As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas. Moreover, wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth.Secondly, large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer. Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays. To add to it, excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers.Lastly, either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth. For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent. Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers.To conclude, Earth is our home and it should be protected. Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage. Creative ideas should be encouraged to leave minimum environmental footprints without compromising quality of life.";The debate over whether human activities are harming or improving the Earth is complex and multifaceted. While it is undeniable that humans have made significant contributions that enhance the quality of life—such as medical advancements, technological innovations, and improvements in infrastructure—it is equally important to acknowledge the detrimental impact that many of these activities have had on the environment.On one side of the argument, proponents of human progress highlight achievements like advancements in healthcare, which have drastically reduced mortality rates and increased life expectancy. Technology has connected us in unprecedented ways, allowing for the sharing of information and ideas, fostering education and economic growth. Urban planning and agricultural practices have transformed landscapes, providing food and shelter to billions. These developments underscore humanity's ability to adapt and enhance the quality of life on Earth.However, the other side presents a compelling case for the environmental degradation caused by these very activities. Industrialization, deforestation, and pollution have led to climate change, loss of biodiversity, and irreversible damage to ecosystems. The burning of fossil fuels contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, which has resulted in global warming, while irresponsible agricultural practices have led to soil depletion and water scarcity. The Earth’s natural resources are being exploited at an alarming rate, threatening the sustainability of our planet for future generations.In conclusion, while human endeavors have undeniably improved aspects of life on Earth, the broader context reveals a critical reality: these advancements often come at a significant environmental cost. The imperative now is to strike a balance—leveraging our capabilities to enhance quality of life while simultaneously committing to sustainable practices that protect the planet. Ultimately, we must recognize that harming the Earth jeopardizes the very foundation of our existence and work collectively to foster a more harmonious relationship with our environment.
107;Some people believe that in order to give opportunities to new generations, companies should encourage high level employees who are older than 55 to retire. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy. Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young, others claim that this is not the case.Admittedly, encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits. Firstly, fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation. This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities. Secondly, having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency. Compared with aged staffs, younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline.However, sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences. From personal level, it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations. It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it, disregard the age and physical capacity. From social perspective, massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government. For example, sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently.In conclusion, even though the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits, it is convincing that it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly.;The debate surrounding the retirement of high-level employees over the age of 55 to create opportunities for younger generations is both complex and multifaceted. While some advocate for encouraging older employees to retire, arguing that this would clear a path for new talent, I believe this approach overlooks the valuable contributions and expertise that seasoned professionals bring to organizations.Firstly, the wealth of experience that older employees possess can be an immense asset to any company. Individuals in high-level positions often have a deep understanding of the industry, cultivated through years of navigating challenges and changes. Their knowledge can guide younger employees, fostering a culture of mentorship and learning that paves the way for innovation and growth within the organization. For example, senior executives can share invaluable insights on strategic decision-making and crisis management that are not easily acquired through academic or entry-level experience.Additionally, age diversity in the workplace can enhance creativity and problem-solving. Teams composed of individuals from various age groups can approach challenges from different perspectives, leading to comprehensive solutions that benefit the entire organization. In many cases, a synergy develops between younger and older employees, where the vigor of youth meets the wisdom of age, creating a dynamic work environment that thrives on collaboration.Moreover, imposing mandatory retirement or pressuring older employees to step down raises ethical concerns. Companies should value their employees' contributions and create flexible work arrangements that allow those older than 55 to continue working, perhaps in mentorship roles or part-time positions. This would benefit not only the employees, allowing them to remain active and engaged, but also the companies that can leverage their vast experience.In conclusion, instead of encouraging retirement for older employees, companies should actively promote an inclusive workplace that values the contributions of individuals regardless of age. Diversity in age can drive innovation, and the experience of senior employees can serve as a cornerstone for nurturing the next generation of leaders.
108;Some people believe that the media, such as the press, TV and internet should be more strictly controlled. Others feel that controls should be loosened to give people freer access to information. Which opinion do you agree with?;Nowadays, one of the most controversial issues related to mass media is the correct amount of control posed on newspapers, televisions and websites. It is argued that the government should exercise less restriction on sharing of media information to public. However, I strongly believe that it should increase the level of control to protect the public against inappropriate contents and unsuitable foreign cultures.One of the strong arguments in favour of tighter media control is to limit the violent and sexual content. They have a serious impact on people in their puberty. For example, an internet cartoon comedy called happy tree is extremely brutal, where the characters usually have their heads or limbs tear off. Another supporting reason is that television companies import foreign programmes from time to time and audiences might accept their ideas which maybe otherwise not welcomed to local culture. A few years ago there was a Japanese game show which involved throwing cream cakes to the loser. This is actually very environmentally unfriendly.The major opposing argument is to protect the safety of citizens. In other words, the government should disclose the information to the media in a timely manner, especially for disasters and outbreak of new diseases. Taking the SARS in 2003 as an example, the Chinese government limited the amount of information for public access which therefore causes numerous deaths. Even so, another perspective on this is to prevent the citizen from unnecessary fear and unrest.Both sides of the arguments have its merits. My personal view is that despite the emphasis of citizen safety, the government should regulate the correct amount of violent and sexual content and censor the culturally unsuitable information. Setting up a council to monitor the media information to the public could be a practical idea.;The debate over the control of media is increasingly relevant in today’s digital age, where information is readily accessible and constantly circulated. On one hand, some argue that the media should be more strictly controlled to prevent the spread of misinformation and protect national security and social cohesion. On the other hand, others advocate for loosening controls to promote freedom of expression and ensure that individuals can access diverse viewpoints. Personally, I align more with the notion that media controls should be loosened, allowing for greater access to information.Firstly, the fundamental principle of democracy hinges on the free flow of information. When media is overly regulated, it risks straying from its role as the fourth pillar of democracy, inhibiting public discourse and informed decision-making. By allowing a wider range of voices to be heard, citizens are equipped with the necessary tools to form their opinions based on an array of perspectives. This pluralism is essential in fostering a healthy society, where diverse cultural, political, and social viewpoints can coexist and contribute to national dialogue.Moreover, controlling media to the extent some advocate for can lead to censorship, breeding an environment of fear rather than one of constructive criticism. Historically, authoritarian regimes have used strict media control as a tactic to suppress dissent and manipulate public perception. In contrast, an informed populace can challenge injustices and influence governance positively.However, it is also crucial to enhance media literacy among the public to combat misinformation. Instead of imposing stringent controls, governments and educational institutions should prioritize educating individuals on critical thinking and differentiating credible sources from unreliable ones.In conclusion, while the need for accountability in media exists, a balanced approach that encourages freedom of expression alongside media literacy is vital. Loosening controls can empower individuals and foster a more informed and engaged society, ultimately benefiting democracy as a whole.
109;Some people think that paying taxes is enough to contribute to the society. Others argue that being a citizen involves more responsibilities. Discuss, what is your opinion?;There is a controversial debate around the world about the duties of citizen. Some people believe that paying tax is the only responsibility of citizens, while others disagree and think that being a person in society involves more responsibilities.Taxes are the income for every country in the world and they are extremely important for developing countries. If people are paying taxes, that means they are taking part in the development of their country as well as the country's economy. Therefore, they have fulfilled their duty as a citizen.Some people argue that individuals of a country are responsible for many other things apart from paying tax. In fact, in order to develop a country, citizens must obey laws, which were imposed by the government. In this way, the crime rate is reduced and society becomes a peaceful place, so the country will develop at a rapid pace. Furthermore, being a citizen in society should protect the country's culture and history. For instance, people should have knowledge about their own culture and history by studying at school with full concentration or reading them from books. On the other hand, a person has to unite with other people in the community so as to develop their nation. Indeed, if people in society have a strong bond with each other, society will become a peaceful place, where people are helping and sharing to each other.Taking everything into account, I strongly believe that being a citizen involves in a number of duties, other than paying taxes. People in society must do more than paying taxes to contribute to their society.;The question of whether paying taxes suffices as a contribution to society or if citizenship entails broader responsibilities is a deeply nuanced issue. On one hand, taxes can be seen as a fundamental civic duty. They fund essential services such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, and security, thereby serving the common good. From this perspective, fulfilling tax obligations can be considered a primary way citizens participate in the social contract, contributing to the welfare and progress of their communities and nation. However, some argue that citizenship encompasses more than mere financial contributions. They contend that being an active citizen involves engaging in societal matters beyond taxation. This includes participating in local governance, voting, volunteering, advocating for social issues, and fostering community ties. Such involvement helps to create a robust democracy, encouraging accountability and responsiveness from leaders, and enabling citizens to express their values and priorities. In my opinion, the responsibilities of citizenship extend significantly beyond paying taxes. While taxes are crucial, they do not fully capture the essence of what it means to be a member of a community. Civic engagement helps to build social capital, strengthens communities, and fosters a sense of belonging and collective responsibility. Engaged citizens can influence policy and advocate for necessary changes, ensuring that their needs and those of their neighbors are being addressed. Ultimately, the interplay of tax payments and broader civic involvement creates a well-rounded society. A responsible citizen should recognize that while taxes are a vital aspect of societal contribution, active engagement fosters a more vibrant, equitable, and just community. Such participation enriches democracy, ensuring that every voice is heard and valued, which is essential for a thriving society.
110;Testing on animals should be made illegal. Agree or disagree?;Perhaps the most serious problem facing the animals' rights today is animal experimentation. Many medical treatments have been discovered by animal testing, including cancer and HIV drugs While most scientists claim that this is vital for improving human health, I believe that primates should have the same rights as human beings.There are several reasons why animal testing should be banned. Firstly, the costs outweigh the benefits. Every year, cosmetic companies, farms or medical schools kill millions of animals to test their products, without any beneficial result. Animal testing costs an enormous amount of money, since they must be fed, cared for and treated with drugs or experimental substances.Secondly, animals are kept in unnatural conditions. Recent studies point out that animals are neglected and treated poorly, which influences their reactions to drugs. In March 2003, a lab technician shot a video inside a lab, which revealed primates in cages without pain medication, for instance one baboon with a metal cylinder screwed into its head. Consequently, I think that sacrificing animals is an expensive and painful activity.There is also the argument that many ethical and genetic principles are broken when testing on animals. Many people agree that it is not only inhumane and cruel to cause pain to animals, but also misleading, since animals and people's response to a drug can be different. I personally believe that human beings have no moral right to use animals in ways that do not benefit the individual.For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that testing on animals has no clear result and consequently, it should be made illegal.;Testing on animals has long been a contentious issue, stirring intense debates among scientists, ethicists, and animal rights activists. I firmly believe that testing on animals should be made illegal due to ethical considerations, the availability of alternative methods, and the questionable reliability of animal testing results.Firstly, the ethical implications of using animals for experimental purposes cannot be overstated. Animals, like humans, are sentient beings capable of experiencing pain, suffering, and distress. Subjecting them to invasive procedures, confinement, and lethal experimentation is fundamentally inhumane. The belief that animals exist solely for human use is a perspective rooted in anthropocentrism, which fails to respect the inherent value of other living beings. Laws and regulations should reflect a society’s moral values, and as we advance in our understanding of animal sentience, it becomes increasingly clear that exploiting animals for testing is morally indefensible.Secondly, the landscape of scientific research is evolving. With advancements in technology, numerous alternative methods to animal testing are becoming accessible and effective. In vitro testing, computer modeling, and organ-on-chip technology are just a few examples of innovative approaches that can replace animal experimentation. These methods not only eschew the ethical dilemmas associated with animal use but also often provide results that are more applicable to human biology, thereby increasing the relevance and success rate of medical research.Lastly, the reliability of animal testing is a significant concern. Studies have shown that a large percentage of drugs that pass animal testing fail in human trials due to safety and efficacy issues. This discrepancy suggests that relying on animal models is not only unethical but also scientifically ineffective, leading to wasted resources and potentially harmful consequences for human health.In conclusion, the practice of testing on animals should be made illegal. Ethical considerations, the emergence of alternative methodologies, and the questionable validity of animal testing results collectively underscore the need for a fundamental shift in our approach to scientific research. A humane and progressive society should prioritize ethical standards that respect all living beings while furthering scientific advancement.
111;"Many people believe that formal ""pen and paper"" examinations are not the best method of assessing educational achievement. What is your view of examinations?Ê";"Examinations are one of the most common methods of measuring learning in education systems throughout the world. At virtually every stage of the learning process, exams are used to verify that the learner is ready to move on to the next stage. However, many believe that the role of examinations should be reconsidered.There are clearly advantages to exams. They help to ensure fairness by imposing the same conditions on all exam candidates. They are also relatively versatile; different types of exam questions, for example, multiple-choice questions and essay tasks, can test different sorts of reasoning ability. However, exams also have some drawbacks. Test-wise candidates can often perform well on exams without having good underlying knowledge or skills. In contrast, some test-takers perform cannot achieve a satisfying result because of anxiety. In this case, teachers and learners focus only on theses aspects of the curriculum that are likely to be tested, thus narrowing the educational experience for all.A number of measures should be taken to address these concerns. Wherever possible, exams should match the content and activities of the learning environment. Exam task should be varied to give fair opportunities to candidates with different types of skills. Other types of assessment should also be considered, assignment writing, for example, to assess independent learning and research skills, or group projects, to measure teamwork ability.In conclusion, it is convincing that exams have a role to play in ensuring proper and objective assessment of achievement. However, exams need to be carefully designed and supplemented with other forms of evaluation if they are to be a truly useful component of the education system.";"Examinations have long served as a cornerstone of educational assessment, traditionally relying on formal ""pen and paper"" methods. However, the efficacy of this approach has been increasingly called into question. While standardized examinations can provide a measure of students' knowledge and understanding, I believe they are not the most effective means of gauging educational achievement.Firstly, formal examinations primarily assess a student’s ability to recall information under pressure, often penalizing those who may possess knowledge but struggle with test anxiety. This approach overlooks critical skills such as creativity, problem-solving, and the ability to apply knowledge in real-world contexts—skills that are increasingly valued in today's job market. For instance, a student may excel in practical collaboration and innovative thinking, yet fail to perform well on a traditional exam due to the stress associated with timed assessments.Additionally, the reliance on ""pen and paper"" exams can inadvertently encourage rote memorization rather than deep understanding. Students may focus on memorizing facts to pass tests, rather than engaging critically with material. This can lead to gaps in knowledge once the exam is completed, which undermines authentic learning.Furthermore, diverse learning styles must be considered. Not all students learn effectively through written examinations. Incorporating alternative assessment methods, such as project-based evaluations, presentations, and group work, allows for a broader demonstration of a student's abilities and fosters a more inclusive learning environment. These methods can capture collaborative skills and promote genuine interest in the subject matter.In conclusion, while formal examinations may provide a standardized means of assessment, they do not adequately reflect the full spectrum of a student's learning or capabilities. A multi-faceted approach to assessment that includes varied methods would better gauge educational achievement and prepare students for the complexities of the modern world."
112;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. However, the governments of richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in such areas.;Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. Poorer nations need help from richer nations in these areas to develop their countries.Firstly, in the area of health, poorer nations normally have less quantity of doctors and nurses compared to richer nations. High population in poorer countries due to lack of family planning caused the proportion of doctors unbalance to the quantity of resident. On top of that, poorer nations are lack of hospitals to fulfill the demand of the patients. To solve these issues, richer nations can contribute by delegating doctors and nurses to these power nations as well as donate money to build hospitals.Secondly, in the area of education, it is generally agreed that poorer countries often lack of teachers in schools as well as lecturers in higher education institutions. Besides that, education for these countries normally is not free so only certain group of students can afford it. In order to solve the education manpower problem, richer countries can allocate experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in poorer countries. Meanwhile, for the issue of education fee, richer countries should offer scholarships and loan to the qualified students.Lastly, in the area of trade, no one can deny that poorer countries are lagging behind richer countries due to shortage of money. Trading are less active in poorer countries may also be caused by incomplete transportation infrastructure. For example, residents in rural areas still depend on their own farm for food production. As a token of goodwill, richer nations can provide financial service to poorer countries to encourage trading. The former can also give consultation on setting up a complete and efficient transportation infrastructure to support trading.In conclusion, richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in all health, education and trade. Improvements in these areas will create a better life for residents in poorer nations which they can use to grow their homeland.;The barriers to development in poorer nations often stem from historical injustices, economic disparities, and systemic inequalities. While it is crucial for these nations to make strides in health, education, and trade, it is equally important for richer nations to shoulder their share of responsibility in assisting these efforts. The interconnectedness of the global economy and the moral obligation of wealthier countries necessitate a more proactive approach to aiding their less affluent counterparts.Improving health outcomes is essential for sustainable development. Poor health undermines productivity and exacerbates poverty cycles. Richer nations can contribute by investing in healthcare infrastructures, providing medical expertise, and supplying essential resources such as vaccines and medicines. Such initiatives not only improve the health of citizens in poorer countries but also foster a global sense of solidarity and cooperation.Similarly, education is pivotal for empowering individuals and transforming societies. Governments of wealthier countries can play a vital role in supporting educational initiatives. This can include funding scholarships for students from poorer nations, facilitating teacher training programs, and sharing educational resources and technologies. An educated population is more capable of tackling economic challenges and leads to a more prosperous global community.Trade presents another avenue for progress. Wealthier nations should work towards fair trade policies that prioritize the needs of poorer countries, allowing them to access markets and compete fairly. This could involve reducing tariffs, eliminating burdensome regulations, and supporting local industries of developing nations.Ultimately, the responsibility for aiding development should not rest solely on the shoulders of poorer nations. Richer countries must recognize the importance of collaborative efforts in improving health, education, and trade. By taking active steps to support these areas, they not only fulfill a moral obligation but also contribute to the creation of a more equitable and prosperous global society.
113;As computers are being used more and more in education, there will be soon no role for teachers in the classroom. Agree or disagree.;In recent years it has become more common for teachers to use technological tools in the learning process. However, I do not agree that this explosion in technology will 'innovate' the education system, by replacing teachers with computers.There are several reasons why teachers will never be replaced by computers. Firstly, computers need to be operated by people. No one can argue that technological tools are must-haves for the classroom of today. For example, lessons are more attractive and easier to understand when they are put on a Power Point presentation and then presented with a LCD Projector. However, scientists prove that every classroom needs trained staff to use these interactive and innovative ways of teaching. I agree that nowadays the learning process benefits greatly from computers, but they are just tools for teachers and they cannot work properly without human's touch.Secondly, children need human interactions. No matter how advanced technology will be, it is clear that a computer will never be able to communicate with its pupils. As a recent interview with Josh Trumm – the founder of the 'Teachers Global Group'- reveals, human interactions will never be imitated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and children is the first step towards a proper education. Without someone who can explain and understand their problems, pupils cannot actually learn'. I am inclined to agree with this scientific view, because only a teacher can feel and connect with pupils, be a friend and a model.In conclusion, there can be no school without a teacher. I think that computers will continue to be used by teachers in the learning process, but they will never take their place. Teachers are not just teachers, they are also friends and conseilieurs.;"The assertion that the increasing integration of computers in education will render teachers obsolete in the classroom is a contentious one. While technology undeniably plays an essential role in modern education, I strongly disagree with the notion that it can fully replace teachers.Firstly, teachers provide a unique human element that technology cannot replicate. They are not merely facilitators of information; they embody mentorship, emotional support, and inspiration. A teacher’s ability to gauge a student's understanding, adapt lessons to their needs, and promote critical thinking is essential for fostering a conducive learning environment. For instance, a computer program may deliver information, but it lacks the capacity to empathize with a student's struggles or celebrate their achievements, both of which are crucial aspects of the educational experience.Moreover, education encompasses more than the mere transmission of knowledge; it involves social and emotional development. Teachers play a pivotal role in creating a sense of community within the classroom. They facilitate discussions, encourage teamwork, and help students navigate interpersonal relationships. These social skills are vital for future success and cannot be cultivated through computer-based learning alone.While technology can enhance the educational experience—offering personalized learning, immediate feedback, and access to a vast array of resources—it should be viewed as a complementary tool rather than a substitute for teachers. Tools like virtual simulations, online assessments, and educational software have the potential to enrich the curriculum, but they are most effective when guided by adept educators who can contextualize and humanize the content.In summary, as computers become an integral part of education, the role of teachers should evolve rather than diminish. They will remain indispensable in guiding, mentoring, and inspiring future generations, proving that technology and human interaction can coexist harmoniously in the classroom."
114;Food can be produced cheaper if we use improved fertilisers and better machinery. However some of methods may be dangerous for human health, and have negative effects for local communities. What is your opinion?;In recent years, the discussion about the agriculture development has become a controversy. While some appear to believe that advanced plant foods incorporate with newly developed devices significantly reduce the cost of producing farm products, others argue that this collaboration exerts a series of negative effects to people's health condition and the society.Admittedly, applying the advanced fertilizers in combine with the automatic reaping resources increase farmers' economic profit. This is because artificial fertilizers catalyze the capacity of each inch of farmland in order to churn out the crops, and automatic machinery enhances the work efficiency of the harvest. Consequently, the production and labour cost of each kilogram of the agriculture products dramatically decreased.However, high-tech fertilizers pose a potential threat to individuals' health well-being. Unlike the organic plant foods, industrialized fertilizers are made of unusual chemicals, which are not only varying the gene of crops into those unknown substances but also remaining inside of plants permanently. In this case, consumers who intake those fertilized products on a regular base tend to suffer a series of disease in the future.Moreover, excessively relying on the electronic equipment for harvest causes several impacts to the society. One is that it worsens the air pollution by releasing the excessive exhaust emission. In contrast, manual harvest prevents severe environmental damages. For another, mechanical reaper causes the rise of the unemployment rate in the farming industry, possibly because high-end reaping plants replace a large number of workers in the fields.In conclusion, even though newly developed plant foods and machinery make significant financial success for the farmers, it is convincing that the demerits of applying these new developments in the agriculture industry cannot be overlooked.;The modernization of agriculture through the use of improved fertilizers and advanced machinery has significantly increased food production and reduced costs. However, the benefits of these advancements are counterbalanced by concerns regarding human health and the negative externalities they impose on local communities.Improved fertilizers, particularly synthetic ones, have revolutionized the way food is grown. They enable crops to receive essential nutrients more efficiently, resulting in higher yields and lower prices for consumers. Similarly, the introduction of better machinery has streamlined farming processes, minimizing labor costs and enhancing productivity. On the surface, these developments appear to create a win-win situation for both food producers and consumers.Nonetheless, the reliance on chemical fertilizers poses a substantial threat to human health. These substances can leach into groundwater, contaminating drinking supplies and leading to various health issues, including respiratory problems and cancers. Furthermore, the excessive use of fertilizers often results in nutrient runoff into local water bodies, leading to detrimental ecological imbalances such as algal blooms. These blooms not only disrupt aquatic ecosystems but can also produce toxins harmful to humans and wildlife alike.Additionally, the mechanization of farming can have socio-economic repercussions for local communities. As advanced machinery replaces manual labor, many small-scale farmers may find themselves unable to compete, leading to job losses and a decline in rural livelihoods. This often results in increased economic disparity, as wealth becomes concentrated among those who can afford the technology. In conclusion, while improved fertilizers and better machinery can enhance food production and affordability, they come with significant risks to human health and local communities. A balanced approach that prioritizes sustainable agricultural practices and safeguards the well-being of all stakeholders is essential to ensure that the advancements in farming benefit society as a whole without compromising health and environmental integrity.
115;Some people think that government should spend money on other important subjects rather helping artists. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, in order to save as much budget as possible and improve the economy of the country, every government around the world is seeking for some ways to spend wisely. Therefore, there is a suggestion that governments should not continue to fund the artists, but they ought to spend money on other necessary subjects such as medical research and space. In my view, I firmly disagree with this recommendation due to several reasons.The main reason why I believe artists should be funded is because art helps to improve the quality of our lives as well as attracting tourists. For example, monuments that represent each city do not only illustrate the city's history and culture, but also make the city more beautiful and an attractive place for tourists. In fact, some countries depend on tourism as their main source of revenue, thus, the governments should help arts because their work crafts are very necessary to boost the tourist industry.In addition, sculptures and paintings in the museums and art galleries generally reflect the culture and civilization of every generation. Therefore, culture and history of a country can be reserved and assured by art. Young people are also able to get more knowledge about their country's history and culture by observing various work crafts.Another reason why artists should be helped is because talent in art is extremely precious and should not be wasted. Indeed, not many people are blessed in the talent of paintings and work crafts. Hence, this type of talent has to be valued as other types of talents such as talent in science or literature.To sum up, art is a very valuable object for every country and the talent in this area cannot be discovered everywhere, so I think governments should help and encourage artists to continue their work.;The debate over whether government funding should prioritize artists or other essential areas has sparked considerable discussion in contemporary society. While it is undeniable that issues such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure deserve substantial financial support, I firmly believe that investing in the arts is equally vital to a well-rounded society.Firstly, art plays a crucial role in cultural identity and expression. It not only reflects the values and experiences of a community but also fosters unity and understanding among diverse populations. Governments that support artists enable the development of a vibrant cultural landscape, which enhances civic pride and promotes tourism. For example, cities renowned for their art scenes, such as Florence or Paris, attract millions of visitors annually, providing significant economic benefits to their regions.Moreover, art is instrumental in driving innovation and creativity in various sectors, including technology and education. Artistic thinking encourages out-of-the-box solutions and the development of new ideas. By prioritizing support for artists, governments can cultivate creative industries that contribute to job creation and economic growth. For instance, the video game industry, which is deeply rooted in artistic talent, has emerged as one of the fastest-growing sectors worldwide.On the other hand, some argue that limited government resources should be allocated to pressing societal issues, such as poverty or health crises. While these concerns are indeed urgent, it should be noted that a flourishing artistic culture can address social issues effectively. Artists often raise awareness about social injustices through their work, stimulating dialogue and promoting change.In conclusion, I contend that government funding for the arts is not a luxury but a necessity. By investing in artists, governments can nurture cultural identity, inspire innovation, and address social issues. A balanced approach that values both the arts and essential services is crucial for a thriving society.
116;Development in technology causes environmental problems. Some people believe the solution in these problems is everyone accepts a simpler way of life, while others say that technology can solve these problems. Discuss both view and give your own opinion.Ê;It is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems. Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems. In the following paragraphs, I intend to discuss both viewpoints.Some people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment. They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment. If people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment.On the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment. They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back. We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart.There are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot. One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa. By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030. By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions. If successful, the impact on the world would be monumental. It would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes. It would mean another industrial revolution.To put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, technology alone can solve the world's environmental problems. We are finally entering an era where engineering and technology are making the world a better place. It would be highly unpractical to ask people to adopt a simpler way of life.;The rapid development of technology has significantly transformed our lives, leading to both advancements and environmental challenges. This has sparked a debate about the best approach to mitigate environmental issues: whether to adopt a simpler way of life or to innovate further using technology.Proponents of a simpler lifestyle argue that modern conveniences have led to increased consumption of resources and heightened pollution. They maintain that by embracing simplicity, individuals can reduce their carbon footprint. Advocates suggest actions such as reducing waste, relying on local produce, and minimizing energy usage. This perspective emphasizes a return to nature and traditional practices, which can foster a more sustainable relationship with the environment. They argue that less reliance on technology can lead to lower emissions and conservation of resources.On the other hand, many believe that technology itself holds the key to solving environmental problems. Innovations such as renewable energy sources, electric vehicles, and sustainable agricultural practices demonstrate potential solutions to reduce our environmental impact. These technological advancements can help us optimize resource usage and create cleaner alternatives to traditional systems. Moreover, advancements in recycling technologies and carbon capture can help address and reverse some of the damage already incurred.In my opinion, a balanced approach is essential. While simplifying our lifestyles can greatly contribute to environmental sustainability, technology also has an indispensable role in addressing the urgent environmental crises we face. Implementing greener technologies while also promoting conscious consumption can create a synergistic effect that maximizes our efforts to safeguard the planet. Ultimately, it is not a matter of choosing one path over the other but rather integrating both strategies to foster a sustainable future. By harmonizing technological innovation with a commitment to simplicity, we can pave the way for a healthier environment.
117;Professional athletes (such as football stars) and entertainers (such as singers and actors) are paid too much money for the work they do. Use specific details and examples to support your answer. ;Some people believe that professional athletes and entertainers are paid reasonable salaries, which can be up to millions of dollars each year. However, that is not equal to their actual contributions to the society. I believe that their salary at a lower level would be more appropriate compared with other peoples in scientific or social, economic fields.First of all, some people claim that athletes and singers deserve their current salary because they have an exceptional ability that other people do not own. For example, hardly anyone could play basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan - a legendary former American player who won several times in the NBA championship. They also point out that these people have to undergo painstaking and industrious training, let alone participate in a great number of contests to be recognized and prove themselves. In addition, although there are many singers and athletes, few of whom could rise to fame and victory ultimately. Overcoming all these obstacles, they should be paid a great deal of money for their extraordinary efforts. However, their talents should not be overrated. Other people say that singers and athletes, in fact, contribute insignificantly to the development of the society. It is assumed the amazing performances they give to the audiences are only valuable in aesthetic and entertaining terms. While scientists invent machines serving daily lives, doctors take care of patients and cure their diseases and policemen help to ensure the safety and stability of the nation, singers and athletes do not play a helpful part in improving the material life. They commit themselves to promoting relaxation and enjoyment for the audience. Indeed, their contribution is less important than those from doctors or scientists, albeit necessary. Hence, their privilege of salary seems groundless, while the main work forces receive modest salaries which only enable them to afford bare necessities.From all analysis suggested above, professional athletes and singers are overpaid in terms of their contributions. I think that there should be a modification in the salary of professional singers and athletes to balance with those of people in other fields, namely science and society, who are the driving forces for the prosperity of the nation.;The salaries of professional athletes and entertainers often spark intense debate over the value of their contributions compared to those in essential professions. Many argue that the millions earned by football stars, singers, and actors are exorbitant, particularly when juxtaposed with the compensation received by teachers, nurses, and other critical service providers.One of the primary reasons for this disparity in pay is the nature of the entertainment industry and professional sports, which thrive on consumer demand and commercial sponsorships. For instance, popular athletes can secure contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars not merely for their performance but because they significantly boost the revenue of leagues and franchises. The National Football League (NFL) generates billions in annual revenue, with star players attracting substantial viewership and sponsorship, making them valuable assets to their teams. However, this raises the question: should entertainment take precedence over essential services?Consider educators, who play a vital role in shaping the future by nurturing young minds. A dedicated teacher in the United States may earn around $50,000 annually, which starkly contrasts with the staggering paychecks of athletes like Patrick Mahomes, who signed a 10-year, $450 million contract. This disparity highlights a societal imbalance in how we value different professions. Moreover, critical workers such as healthcare professionals often work under immense pressure and long hours, especially evident during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, yet their compensation remains relatively modest.Furthermore, the glorification of celebrity culture exacerbates these financial inequalities. As society places a premium on entertainment, the compensation for athletic and entertainment figures continues to escalate. While they undeniably contribute to cultural experiences and joy, the inflated salaries provoke concerns about misplaced priorities and the potential neglect of more impactful professions. Ultimately, while talent and charisma deserve recognition, the argument persists that the earnings of professional athletes and entertainers are out of proportion, particularly when weighed against the essential work of those in the public service field.
118;Some people think that computers and the Internet are more important for a child's education than going to school. But others believe that schools and teachers are essential for children to learn effectively. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;With the number of technological advances growing apace, it is generally believed that Internet and computers will supplant the traditional role of teachers in a not too distant future. This idea may point out to two main directions, both of which present different arguments.Central to the supporting arguments of this issue is the idea that the global online network is the inexhaustible source of information, which definitely exceeds the fund of knowledge that any veteran teacher can accumulate. Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge, ranging from visual to aural stimuli, which make learning an ever enjoyable experience, especially for children.On the other hand, critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable, there still remain certain shortcomings. Much information as the Internet may provide, most of the sources are unjustified by experts. As a result, information from those sources is subject to question. Admittedly, the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can. Through face-to-face communication, teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore, adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students. This is where the computer proves to be incompetent.In short, although both sides have their equally valid arguments, I am inclined to think that although Internet can be a useful tool for education, at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced.;The debate over the importance of computers and the Internet compared to traditional schooling for a child's education is a topic of considerable relevance in today's technology-driven society. Proponents of digital learning argue that the vast resources available online offer unparalleled opportunities for self-directed learning. With the Internet, children can access a plethora of information, educational videos, and interactive tutorials that may not be available in a conventional classroom setting. This flexibility allows them to learn at their own pace and explore areas of interest in depth. Moreover, technological proficiency is increasingly viewed as essential for navigating the modern world, positioning online resources as indispensable tools for education.Conversely, advocates for traditional schooling emphasize the critical role that teachers and structured learning environments play in a child's development. Schools provide not only academic knowledge but also essential social skills, emotional support, and the ability to work collaboratively. Teachers are trained to identify students' strengths and weaknesses, tailoring instruction to meet diverse needs in ways that AI or automated systems cannot replicate as effectively. Furthermore, schools foster a sense of community and belonging, helping children to develop interpersonal skills crucial for future success.In my opinion, a harmonious integration of both perspectives is necessary for effective education. While the Internet serves as a valuable supplement to the traditional curriculum, it cannot replace the comprehensive developmental benefits provided by teachers and schools. A blended approach, incorporating both digital resources and classroom learning, allows for a well-rounded education that prepares children not only academically but also socially and emotionally for the complexities of life. Ultimately, striking a balance between these two methods will equip students with the skills and knowledge they need to thrive in an increasingly digital world while maintaining essential human connections.
119;Capital punishment (the death penalty) is necessary in order to control the amount of violent crimes in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Capital punishment is a controversial debate in many countries. In a world where brutal crimes need to be deterred, it may be true that the death penalty is an efficient retribution to admonish the violence. However, as the society grows, human rights become more highly respected, ""murdering"" criminals is therefore immoral and hard to accept.First of all, it is recognized that every human being has the right to live and no authority is empowered to deprive one of life. Although what criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, they are humans and their lives need to be valued. In addition, execution does not resolve the consequences of crime, not to mention it could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled.Secondly, capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives. Moreover, in terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away.The third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted. Juries are also humans, they may lack of discretion. Thus, many people are executed for the crime they did not commit, which leads to a question of fairness in judicial system.In conclusion, although capital punishment presents an extreme warning to the community, I firmly object to it because it is absurd and inhumane. Furthermore, it can be replaced by a life sentence.";Capital punishment, often regarded as a controversial form of justice, sparks intense debate regarding its necessity in controlling violent crime. Advocates argue that the death penalty serves as a deterrent, instilling fear in potential offenders, while opponents contend it is inhumane and ineffective.Supporters of capital punishment assert that the existence of the death penalty can significantly reduce serious crimes, particularly murder. The theory of deterrence posits that the fear of facing the ultimate consequence—execution—may dissuade individuals from committing egregious acts. Historical statistics often showcase a correlation between the implementation of death penalty laws and a subsequent decline in homicide rates, although causation remains a complex issue. Moreover, the severity of punishment conveys societal condemnation of heinous acts, reinforcing the idea that certain crimes are intolerable.Conversely, numerous studies indicate that the death penalty does not reliably deter crime more effectively than life imprisonment without parole. Factors such as socio-economic conditions, mental health issues, and a lack of education often play pivotal roles in criminal behavior—factors that the threat of capital punishment may not address. Additionally, the potential for wrongful convictions raises profound ethical concerns. The irreversible nature of the death penalty means that an innocent life could be unjustly taken, a risk that society should be unwilling to bear.Furthermore, the focus on capital punishment may detract from investing in preventive measures that address the root causes of violent crime. Initiatives in education, mental health support, and community development could lead to meaningful reductions in crime rates, fostering a safer society without resorting to state-sanctioned death.In conclusion, while capital punishment may have its proponents who believe in its deterrent effect on violent crime, the evidence suggests that it is not a panacea. Therefore, I maintain that rather than relying on the death penalty, society should prioritize comprehensive strategies that tackle the underlying issues contributing to violence.
120;Businesses should do anything they can to make a profit. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;There is no doubt that companies, factories and businesses establish to provide products which are people's need and make a profit for their managers. However, I completely disagree with the idea that businesses should be allowed to do anything they want to make a profit. With this permission they are allowed to hit and damage everything for just making a profit.Firstly, if there is not any control on the businesses and they are permitted to do everything they want, they will threaten the beings' life such as human, animals and plants. As every day we read and hear in televisions and newspapers that some factories hit the environment by their toxic substances.Moreover, if we let them do anything they can to just make a profit, they will produce products with low qualities and high prices, therefore they might hit consumer's life. For instance, a few months ago it was broadcast from TV that a company which produced baby milk, sold milk which did not have quality and it caused a few babies die.In conclusion, all companies, factories and businesses should be monitored by governments and executive, and they do not have to let do anything they want just due to making profit. They can hit both the environment and human's life easily.;The assertion that businesses should do anything they can to make a profit is a contentious one and invites a range of perspectives. While profitability is indeed a primary goal for any business, the approach taken to achieve this goal is crucial and should be weighed against ethical considerations, social responsibilities, and long-term sustainability.On one hand, proponents of relentless profit-making argue that in a capitalist society, businesses operate within a competitive landscape where financial success is essential for survival. Without profits, a company cannot sustain operations, pay its employees, or innovate. This perspective holds that businesses owe it to their stakeholders, including shareholders and employees, to maximize profit. Additionally, successful businesses often contribute to economic growth, job creation, and technological advancement by reinvesting their profits.Conversely, the idea of prioritizing profit at any cost can lead to unethical practices and disregard for critical social and environmental responsibilities. Companies that focus solely on enriching themselves may engage in exploitative labor practices, environmental degradation, or misleading marketing strategies. Such approaches can erode public trust and damage a business's reputation. In an age of heightened consumer awareness, many people are inclined to support businesses that demonstrate integrity and social consciousness. This shift toward ethical consumerism suggests that a more balanced approach—where profit is pursued alongside ethical standards—could yield better long-term results.Moreover, businesses that prioritize corporate social responsibility often enjoy better customer loyalty and employee satisfaction. Such companies create a positive cycle where ethical practices and profitability coexist, ultimately contributing to a healthier economy and society.In conclusion, while profit is undoubtedly an important objective for businesses, pursuing it should not come at the expense of ethical standards and social responsibility. A sustainable business model acknowledges that long-term success is best achieved by aligning profit motives with the broader interests of society.
121;It is recently announced that a new high school may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan?;Although some of my neighbors will oppose this idea, personally I approve it. The new high school will bring a lot of advantages to my community. The high school of my district is pretty old and lacks in necessities for students, so they can't get enough education. I really believe that new high school is a great addition to the educational system of my community.	Firstly, I think that the new high school will bring a lots of opportunities for student concerned in education. Their old high school is pretty old and need in new educational materials, repairing of the place for sport activities. Also the laboratory of physics and chemistry was in bad condition, so the students can't study well during the classes. They will study with new breath and great enthusiasm in new school. Secondly, the new high school will be a place for new connections between the student of different communities and districts of the city. After classes students and not only the students will get together in building of high school, participate in different competitions. For instance during the football match the students of different high schools will come and after the competition they will keep in touch. This will increase the social connections of the students. The only disadvantage is the noisiness of the competitions. The people living in the neighborhood will be a bit perturbed, but I think this isn't a important reason for ceasing the competitions. To sum up, this new construction has a lot of advantages like new connections between students from different communities, also the new educational equipment will increase the students' enthusiasm toward studying. The only disadvantage is the nosiness of competitions which students will participate, but I think that it isn't a big deal. So the new high school will be a great addition for my environment.;The announcement of a new high school in my neighborhood presents a range of benefits that I wholeheartedly support. Education is a cornerstone of community development, and the addition of a high school can significantly enhance the quality of educational opportunities available to local students.Firstly, the establishment of a new high school is likely to alleviate overcrowding in existing schools. In many areas, students are crammed into classrooms with limited resources, which can hinder effective learning. A new high school would provide a much-needed solution to this issue, allowing for smaller class sizes and more individualized attention from teachers. This improvement in the learning environment would be instrumental in fostering better academic outcomes for students.Additionally, a new high school can enhance community engagement and support. With more local teenagers attending school nearby, parents and residents alike are likely to become more involved in school activities, ranging from sports to academic competitions. This increased participation can help build a stronger sense of community and cultivate relationships among families, contributing to a supportive network for students.Moreover, a high school presents opportunities for partnerships with local businesses and organizations, which can lead to expanded programs, internships, and resources for students. Such collaborations not only enrich the educational experience but also prepare students for the workforce by providing them with practical skills and real-world experiences.Overall, I believe that the construction of a new high school in our neighborhood is a positive development. It promises to enhance educational quality, foster community ties, and provide students with valuable opportunities for personal and professional growth. Supporting this plan aligns with the broader goal of investing in our youth and ensuring they have access to the resources they need to succeed.
122;Parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their older (15 - 18 year old) teenaged children. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It might seem that teenaged children particularly in age of 15 - 18 are fully grown, so they do not need any help for making important decisions. However, in my opinion, teenagers need more attention and help in comparison with the higher ages. I will discuss my view in two main areas.In the first place, there is no doubt that parents and other adult relatives are more experienced towards children, therefore they are the best advisor for their children. They have experienced a large numbers of stuffs during their life, so if children listen to their advices they can prevent happening worst things. Also, they can save value things in their life such as time and money, and enjoy they life with the best way.Moreover, I have always believed that parents and adults relatives are the best friends and consular for the teenagers, because unfortunately nowadays there are some individuals who cheat the others for gaining more power and money. They cheat young ages because they believe they are immature and they can trap them easily.To sum up, it makes no difference, people from young ages to old ages are free to make a decision, nonetheless sometimes to prevent some problems coming up for young individuals , it is a good idea to ask parents and adult relatives to give a piece of advice.;The question of whether parents or adult relatives should make important decisions for their teenage children aged 15 to 18 is a complex one, filled with valid arguments on both sides. However, I largely disagree with the statement, believing that while parental guidance is crucial, teenagers should be encouraged to make their own decisions to foster independence and critical thinking.Firstly, the late teenage years are a vital period for personal development. During this time, adolescents begin to form their identities and values. If parents or adult relatives make decisions for them, it may hinder their ability to think critically and take responsibility for their choices. Allowing teenagers to make decisions, even if they lead to mistakes, contributes to personal growth and helps them learn invaluable life lessons. This stage is essential for building confidence and preparing them to handle situations in adulthood.Moreover, the world is rapidly changing, and the challenges teenagers face today are often very different from those faced by previous generations. As society evolves, teenagers must learn to navigate these changes independently. By making decisions on their own, they develop critical problem-solving skills and resilience, traits essential for success in future academic, professional, and personal endeavors.On the other hand, the role of guidance from parents cannot be overstated. Parents possess life experience and wisdom that can provide a valuable framework for decision-making. However, this support should be more of a collaborative approach rather than a directive one. By engaging in discussions and allowing teenagers to express themselves, parents can help their children weigh options without preventing them from making their own choices.In conclusion, while parental advice is essential for teenagers, allowing them to make their own important decisions is beneficial for their development. This balance can help teenagers become more responsible, confident individuals, ready to face the world as adults.
123;Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;You hardly ever can find a person who says that he or she had unpleasant childhood. When individuals reminisce their memories they absolutely infer to some of their childhood events. As much as their events might were bitter, in their adulthood they are sweet. In my opinion, childhood is definitely the happiest time of people life in two main areas.In the first place, children are free whatever they want to do, they are not restricted and their limitation are really rare. Because they are in the age of growth and they are allowed whatever they want to do to experience new stuffs. Therefore there is no argument and punishment for them.In addition, in this age they are not expected to be responsible. Also, they do not have to educate and they do not have to work, so they have a lot of time in their hand to enjoy this stage of their life. As a matter of fact, I made a large number of friends in this age, and I almost traveled to all cities of my county when I was in kindergarten. Also I got familiar with different kind of animals and plants in this age.All in all, I would maintain that the best phase of people life is their childhood. They not only free to do whatever they want without any confine or punishment, but also they are free and have a lot of time in their hands to try and experience new things and enjoy them.;Childhood is often heralded as the happiest time of a person’s life, a sentiment echoed by many who reminisce about their formative years. While there is merit to this perspective, it is crucial to consider the complexity of human experiences. I partially agree with the statement, as childhood can indeed offer unparalleled joy and innocence, but it is not universally true for everyone.One of the most appealing aspects of childhood is the inherent sense of wonder and imagination that children possess. The world is a vast playground filled with endless possibilities. Children experience joy in simple pleasures: playing outside, making new friends, and discovering the beauty of nature. This unencumbered exploration fosters creativity and curiosity, creating cherished memories that often last a lifetime. Furthermore, during childhood, responsibilities are minimal, and the pressures of adult life are nonexistent, leading many to view these years as a carefree period.However, it is essential to acknowledge that childhood is not uniformly joyful for all. Many children face hardships such as poverty, abuse, or family instability, which can overshadow their early years with trauma and emotional distress. Statistics show that adverse childhood experiences can have lasting effects on mental health, indicating that for some, childhood may be a time marked by challenges rather than happiness. Thus, while some can look back at their childhood with fondness, others bear scars that can influence their outlook on life permanently.In conclusion, while childhood can indeed be a period of innocence and joy, the reality is nuanced. It is marked by both light and shadow, shaping individuals in different ways. Ultimately, happiness is subjective, and the experiences of childhood can vary immensely from one person to another, making it difficult to universally declare this phase as the happiest time of life.
124;People attend college and university for many reasons. Why do you think people attend college and university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your idea.;From many centuries ago, universities have been playing an important role in ones' life. Different people attend university for different point of views. In my perspective, the three most reasons are increased knowledge, career preparation and new experiences.First of all, for most people, university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding. Truthfully, in this wonderful academic environment, everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers. Thus, people are able to strengthen their knowledge. Moreover, through the instructions of teachers, the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory, library, students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect. Therefore, they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying.Secondly, studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life, which included many new experiences. The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous, more than any school one person have studied. Thus, students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation, even from the whole world. For instance, my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, etc. And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment, which is one of his main purposes when attending university. Last but not least, preparing for career is an essential function of university. Students not only do homework, assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work, internship and part time job. Thus, they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are. After all, they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives.In summation, people may attend university for various reasons. Some want to enjoy new experiences, some are going to prepare for their future career, while others are eager to develop their understanding. Even though the purposes could be various, everybody who is studying in university should concentrate on the objectives and try their best.;People attend college and university for a multitude of reasons, each reflecting individual aspirations, ambitions, and life circumstances. Three primary motivations stand out: the pursuit of knowledge, career advancement, and personal development.Firstly, the pursuit of knowledge drives many students to seek higher education. College and university environments provide access to a vast array of subjects, expert faculty, and extensive resources that foster intellectual growth. For instance, a student passionate about environmental science may choose to attend university to engage deeply with topics such as climate change, sustainability, and ecological conservation. This academic exploration not only broadens one’s understanding of the world but also fosters critical thinking and analytical skills, essential for any professional field.Secondly, career advancement remains a significant motivator for enrollment in higher education institutions. Many professions require not only specialized knowledge but also credentials that can only be attained through formal education. For example, aspiring healthcare professionals, engineers, and teachers typically need to complete specific degree programs to qualify for licensure or gain employment. Furthermore, in today’s competitive job market, a college degree often serves as a minimum requirement, making it crucial for individuals aiming to secure stable, well-paying jobs.Lastly, college and university also serve as spaces for personal development. These institutions provide students with opportunities to grow socially and emotionally. By participating in extracurricular activities, students learn teamwork, leadership, and time management. Moreover, the diverse environments of colleges and universities expose students to varied perspectives, enhancing their understanding of cultural differences and social issues. A student involved in a debate club or volunteer work not only hones their communication skills but also develops empathy and social responsibility.In conclusion, people attend college and university for deep-rooted reasons ranging from the quest for knowledge and career aspirations to personal growth. Each reason reflects the multifaceted opportunities offered by higher education, highlighting its vital role in preparing individuals for both professional success and enriched lives.
125;Do you agree or disagree? It's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.;There is no need for me to put any emphasis on the advantage of having a large number of casual acquaintance. However, I still agree that it's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.We can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant. First, it's not easy to make friend with anyone. I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other. After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities, for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways. Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances. We spend time together but we could never be friend. So, it's much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends.Second, close friends can easily understand each others feelings. Because of the similarity I talked before, acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends. Moreover, they wouldn't even spare time to consider your feelings. Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time. Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend. When my friend is sick, I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible. If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail, I will try my best to pull him back, but not stand and stare like it's not of my business. And I believe my friend will do the same to me. In conclusion, a friend is a person you care about. To me, friends are the most important people in my life second to my family. I am the kind of person who has only one or two close friends, and I am fully content that I have such nice friends. If someone exchange my friends with thousands of acquaintances, I will definitely say NO.;The value of friendship has long been a subject of discussion, with individuals often contemplating the significance of quality versus quantity in their social circles. I firmly agree that having one or two close friends is preferable to maintaining a large number of casual acquaintances. This preference stems from several factors, including emotional intimacy, support systems, and the overall quality of interpersonal relationships.Firstly, having a few close friends fosters deeper emotional connections. When friendships are meaningful, they allow individuals to share their thoughts, fears, and aspirations without the fear of judgment. This level of vulnerability creates a strong bond, enabling friends to understand each other on a profound level. In contrast, casual acquaintances may provide superficial interactions that often lack the depth necessary for real support during challenging times.Additionally, close friends tend to provide more substantial emotional support. In times of distress or hardship, it is invaluable to have someone who is not just present but genuinely invested in our well-being. Close friends are more likely to stand by us, offering comfort and guidance, as opposed to acquaintances, who may lack the commitment or understanding needed to provide meaningful assistance.Moreover, the quality of interaction with close friends is often more fulfilling than the frequent but shallow interactions that casual relationships typically involve. Engaging in deeper conversations and shared experiences with a few close friends often leads to lasting memories and a stronger sense of belonging.In conclusion, while social networks can provide diverse benefits, the emotional richness, meaningful support, and enhanced satisfaction derived from one or two close friendships greatly outweigh the advantages of maintaining a broad array of casual acquaintances. Quality friendships not only enrich our lives but also contribute positively to our mental and emotional health, making them invaluable throughout our journey.
126;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when your grandparents were children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"The life today is totally different from half centuries before. Advances in technology do help humans to solve abundant of problems; however it also deprives of some things that we had. In my opinion, life in the old days brings more happiness to people than today for several reasons.The first reason is life is simple in the past. Nowadays, all humans compete together. Since world population getting higher, competition is getting fierce. If you are not able to handle your jobs, then someone will replace you right away. People need to put much more effort to keep their living condition. Therefore, lives in the old days is easier than today.Second, the environment today is serious damaged. Looking out the windows, what I see isn't sky, trees or mountains, but is coldly high buildings. Everyday, I walk on hard roads, breath in polluted air, and live in a limited space. What's worse, it has been proved that living in this kind of condition will result in some mental diseases. Thus, the environment our grandparents live is more comfortable than today.The third reason is that the pace of life. Today, we are able to read the news all over the world, to chat with people through the Internet, or to travel around the world by planes; however, it also means that any thing happens in the world will affect our life. If we cannot react properly and immediately, then we will be in a vulnerable situation. We have no choice but have to live in a fast pace.In conclusion, while there some people live in a pretty good condition, it is only a minority. People are put too much focus on making wealth and progress in technology; nevertheless, behind the glamorous facade of it, what we loss will never be returned.";In today's fast-paced world, many would argue that life is indeed easier and more comfortable than it was for our grandparents when they were children. I wholeheartedly agree with this statement, as advancements in technology, healthcare, and societal changes have significantly transformed everyday life, making it more convenient and enjoyable.Firstly, the technological revolution has profoundly impacted the way we live and work. Today, we have access to the internet, smartphones, and a plethora of appliances that streamline daily tasks. For instance, communication is instantaneous—my grandparents relied on letters and landline phones, often waiting days or weeks for a reply. Now, we can connect with loved ones across the globe in seconds via text or video call. This ease of communication enhances relationships and nurtures connections that were once difficult to maintain.Moreover, advancements in healthcare have drastically improved our quality of life. Medical technology has evolved, allowing for faster diagnoses and effective treatments that were unavailable in the past. Vaccinations and improved public health policies have led to a significant decline in infectious diseases, which were prevalent during my grandparents' childhood. They often faced health challenges that are now preventable or treatable, thus experiencing greater overall health risks.Additionally, societal changes have contributed to a more comfortable life. The evolution of gender roles and the push for equality have led to greater access to education and employment opportunities. My grandparents may have faced limitations based on their gender or socio-economic status, but today, individuals from diverse backgrounds can pursue their aspirations more freely.In conclusion, life today, with its technological advancements, improved healthcare, and progressive societal norms, is undoubtedly easier and more comfortable than it was for our grandparents. These developments not only enhance our daily experiences but also empower us to lead healthier, more fulfilling lives.
127;High school should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Agree or disagree?;High school is the time when you decide your future career and particular field you want to concentrate and interested in. In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice, to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude.First of all, as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study. Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights. As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams.Next, students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades. Also, we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students. For example, when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other. Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit.Lastly, the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she/he has an aptitude. When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education. Furthermore, this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses.In conclusion, as a young women I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement so it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well. Having three reasons helps us to bring up students who are well-educated, with a bright and independent mind.;High school should indeed allow students the flexibility to choose the courses they wish to study. This approach recognizes the diverse interests and strengths of students, fostering a more engaging and personalized educational experience. In an era increasingly characterized by specialization, enabling students to explore subjects that resonate with their aspirations can lead to greater motivation and enthusiasm for learning.One of the primary advantages of allowing students to choose their own courses is that it encourages autonomy and responsibility. When students have the power to select their educational path, they are likely to take ownership of their learning. This shift can enhance their commitment to academic pursuits and cultivate critical thinking skills, as they make informed decisions about their futures. Furthermore, when students are passionate about the subjects they are studying, they often perform better academically, resulting in higher levels of achievement and satisfaction.Moreover, a curriculum that is tailored to student interests can help prepare them for future careers. In a world that increasingly values specialized knowledge and skills, giving students the opportunity to pursue courses relevant to their intended professions can provide a significant advantage. For instance, a student interested in environmental science could benefit from courses in biology, chemistry, and even policy-making, positioning them for success in their future studies and careers.However, it is essential to strike a balance between choice and required foundational courses to ensure that students receive a comprehensive education. While students should have the right to explore their interests, core subjects such as mathematics, science, and humanities should remain mandatory to equip them with essential skills.In conclusion, allowing high school students the freedom to choose their courses can foster a more motivated and responsible learner. Emphasizing personal interest intertwined with a solid academic foundation prepares students for success in both higher education and their eventual careers, making this approach a crucial evolution in educational practices.
128;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks, while others seem to prefer the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to live in a higher pace condition. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks, and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam. I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test. Therefore, we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy. If I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully. For instance, I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing. Hence, from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy. In contrast, it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I prefer to live in high pace. It is not to say, of course that other points of view are totally without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and plausible.";In today's fast-paced world, people often find themselves caught in a relentless rush to meet deadlines, attend meetings, and accomplish tasks. Some thrive in this environment, relishing the energy of a busy schedule. However, I firmly believe in the merits of a slower-paced lifestyle and the benefits it brings to mental health and overall well-being.Firstly, taking life at a slower pace allows for a deeper appreciation of the world around us. When we hurry, we often overlook the beauty in simple moments—a blooming flower, a child's laughter, or a breathtaking sunset. For example, during a solo walk in the park, I find that the slower I walk, the more I notice. I can observe families picnicking, artists painting landscapes, and birds chirping. These small pleasures enrich my life and bring a sense of joy that I might miss in a hurried rush.Moreover, a slower pace enables individuals to cultivate mindfulness and reduce stress. The act of savoring our experiences can lead to improved mental clarity and emotional resilience. By taking time to reflect on our daily actions or engage in relaxing activities like reading or meditating, we provide ourselves with the opportunity to recharge our mental batteries. For instance, I have adopted a practice of morning meditation before starting my day, which has made me feel more centered and capable of handling life's challenges.Furthermore, a slower life encourages deeper connections with others. In our rush, we often neglect meaningful conversations or miss opportunities to build relationships. Taking time to engage with friends and family, whether through shared meals or casual outings, fosters stronger bonds and nurtures our emotional health.In conclusion, while a fast-paced lifestyle may suit some, I advocate for a more intentional approach to living. By embracing a slower pace, we can cultivate mindfulness, appreciate the beauty around us, and foster meaningful connections, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling life.
129;Tourism is a multibillion-dollar industry that supports economic development. However, some people think that it causes too much damage to the local environment and culture. What do you think?;Tourist trade is becoming a powerful engine for the economy. Nevertheless, some individuals believe that this position ignores the ecological and environmental destruction, as a result of tourist activities, and its adverse effects on local communities and ecosystems. While both positions seem reasonable, my view is that, through proper management and regulation, a booming tourist industry is an excellent source of economic growth and wealth for rural and urban areas.The most obvious merit is that tourism can vastly boost economic development in a particular state or region. This takes place, not only through direct expenditure from tourists, but also because it provides direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, agriculture, and in the service industry. The increasing tax and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury goods amongst others are also a result of a solid, well-regulated tourism programs. Furthermore, tourism provides a considerable number of direct and indirect jobs to the community, including retail, hotels, transport, agriculture, and in the service industry. This increase of job opportunities allows more people to make significant contribution to society through the purchasing of commodities by their growing incomes. As a result, this gives energy to the economic cycle, generating local economic prosperity in return.Some people may oppose these, citing the environmental and cultural destruction caused by tourism. In fact, compared to the tourism industry, other alternatives, like resource extraction and manufacture, are far worse destroyers. For instance, paper mills pour hundreds and thousands of tons of contamination into rivers, causing severe water pollution. On the other hand, the dramatic majority of tourist, particularly those who tend to spending a wealth of time and money locating and visiting rustic villages, are well educated. It is illogical to believe that these rational folks will not conduct themselves decently if required to do so.After careful consideration of both sides of the argument, the tourism sector is desirable for its important socioeconomic advantages. In conclusion, it is evident that under suitable administration, the benefits of tourism outweigh its drawbacks.;"Tourism is undeniably a multibillion-dollar industry that plays a critical role in global economic development, providing millions of jobs and generating significant revenue for local, regional, and national economies. However, despite its financial benefits, the negative impact on local environments and cultures is a pressing concern that merits serious consideration.On one hand, the economic advantages of tourism cannot be overstated. It creates employment opportunities in various sectors, including hospitality, transportation, and entertainment, thereby reducing unemployment rates and improving living standards. Many countries heavily rely on tourism as a primary income source, utilizing funds from tourist activities to support infrastructure and public services, such as education and healthcare. Moreover, tourism promotes cultural exchange and understanding, allowing visitors to engage with local traditions and lifestyles, which can be beneficial in fostering deeper relationships between different cultures.Conversely, the environmental consequences of mass tourism are often dire. Popular destinations can suffer from overcrowding, leading to pollution, habitat destruction, and depletion of natural resources. For instance, beaches can become littered with waste, while delicate ecosystems may be disrupted by the influx of tourists. Additionally, the cultural impact cannot be overlooked; as local customs and traditions become commercialized to cater to tourists, there is a risk of cultural dilution. This can lead to a loss of authenticity and identity, where traditional practices are reshaped merely for the sake of tourism.In conclusion, while tourism serves as a vital economic engine, it is essential to strike a balance between financial gains and the preservation of local environments and cultures. Sustainable tourism practices, which prioritize ecological conservation and respect for local heritage, are crucial in ensuring that the benefits of tourism do not come at the expense of the environment or cultural integrity. By promoting responsible travel and encouraging eco-friendly practices, we can strive to support local economies without compromising their unique landscapes and traditions."
130;The government should allocate more funds to public services instead of wasting money on arts such as music, painting and so on. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion;The issue of governmental financing provision to aesthetic features in the society has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that the budget allocation to the arts is waste of national resources and the money should instead be spent on public services, I contend that this investment in field of the arts would be in the best interest of a society.First of all, there is no doubt that governments are liable for providing societies with appropriate public services and adequate facilities in an efficient way. Admittedly, no one should suffer from any sort of deficiency in field of health, education, transportation and communication. However, these could only help individuals with their physical requirements. There is also a burden on the government to highly concern about the people mental health initiatives which would be unconsciously or sensibly provided by the arts.On top of this, the arts play a pivotal role in all-round development of a society. No developed country could be named that music, painting, literature and other fields of arts are out of its government consideration. Enriching people's life and enlightening their thoughts, the arts basically affect the enhancement of societies in many positive ways.Furthermore, investing in art could bring employment opportunities and could end in return of capital occasionally. The investment could be paid back through the values of the created works of art which as a matter of fact should be considered as national possessions. To sum up, not only could investing in art be considered as wasting money at any kind, but also it would enriches the culture of the society and governments and individuals would benefit from it in multiple ways.;"The debate over the allocation of government funds between public services and the arts is a contentious one, drawing strong emotions from both sides. While proponents of prioritizing public services over the arts argue that resources should be directed towards essential services like healthcare, education, and infrastructure, I believe that a harmonious balance must be struck, and that the arts play a vital role in society that merits significant funding.Firstly, public services are undeniably crucial for maintaining the well-being of citizens. Adequate funding is essential for ensuring quality healthcare, safe transportation systems, and accessible education. However, the argument that arts funding is a ""waste"" overlooks the profound benefits that arts and culture provide to society. Engaging with the arts fosters creativity, cultural understanding, and critical thinking skills—all of which contribute to a more informed and cohesive society.Moreover, investing in the arts can have significant economic benefits. Cultural sectors often stimulate local economies, create jobs, and promote tourism. Cities with a vibrant arts scene tend to attract visitors, which can lead to increased spending in various local businesses. When the government invests in the arts, it promotes a sense of community and belonging, enhancing quality of life for all citizens.In addition, the arts serve as a mirror to society, allowing individuals to explore complex social issues and emotions. They provoke thought, inspire dialogue, and reflect diverse cultures and experiences, thus enriching our collective consciousness. It is vital to recognize that funding for the arts is not a frivolous expense but an investment in societal development.In conclusion, I strongly believe that while public services should undoubtedly remain a priority, the arts deserve a substantial portion of government funding as well. By supporting both, we nurture a well-rounded society that values creativity alongside essential services, ultimately fostering a healthier, more inclusive, and dynamic community."
131;The idea of having a single career is becoming an old fashioned one. The new fashion will be to have several careers or ways of earning money and further education will be something that continues throughout life.;"The career itself became the motto of living since the beginning of industrialization in the late 19th century. People usually tend to have a single career as a means of living. However, a modern trend reveals that new generations are more interested to perform several jobs and also would like to gain multiple higher educational certificates in order to earn more and to gain financial security.A full time job with a steady income was enough for a potential employee to support himself and his family. But with the recent recession, almost all the countries all over the world are seeing significant economic downfall. This overwhelming crisis is prompting delayering and reduction of workers. As a result, people are focusing on doing several jobs or gaining further qualification to secure their economic condition.Moreover, the arrival of technology has also been playing a major role promoting further unemployment. The official term of it is named ""Technological Unemployment"". North American economists have published reports after scrutinizing the recent American economic situation that, technology is eliminating more jobs than creating one. For example, robots, automation and softwares are taking over manual human workers professions such as clerks, interpreters, security services, retails and specially in manufacturing companies. Thus many people's jobs are now at high stake. The best way to ensure a flexible earning is getting more jobs. Last but not least, corporational policy to to pay less to inferiors is another reason that drives labours to work on different sectors.For the reasons mentioned above, I believe that people are now more conscious to gain more educational qualification and also are more interested to work on various fields simultaneously to earn more and support themselves.";The traditional concept of a single career lasting a lifetime is increasingly becoming obsolete in today’s dynamic and interconnected world. The rapid pace of technological advancement and globalization has redefined the nature of work, leading to the emergence of diverse career trajectories. Rather than adhering to a singular career path, individuals now find themselves exploring multiple avenues for earning money and personal fulfillment throughout their lives.One reason for this shift is the rapid evolution of industries, driven largely by technological innovation. Jobs that exist today may not be relevant in a few years, demanding that individuals adapt to new roles and sectors. As a result, the ability to pivot and embrace change becomes essential. Workers are increasingly expected to develop a broader skill set that can apply to various fields, leading to a more flexible approach to career development.Moreover, the gig economy has emerged as a viable alternative to traditional employment. Many individuals now engage in freelance work, side hustles, or entrepreneurial endeavors while pursuing their primary careers. This diversification of income sources not only enhances financial stability but also allows for greater exploration of personal interests. For instance, someone might work as a software developer by day while nurturing a passion for photography on the weekends. This blending of professions can lead to a richer, more fulfilling life.Lifelong learning is another significant aspect of this evolving career landscape. Continued education, whether through formal institutions or online platforms, allows individuals to acquire new skills and knowledge relevant to various fields. Such an approach fosters adaptability and encourages personal growth, which aligns with the modern workforce's demand for continuous development.In conclusion, the idea of a single career is being replaced by a multifaceted approach where individuals pursue multiple careers and embrace lifelong learning. In today’s ever-changing world, this newfound flexibility offers exciting opportunities and a path toward personal and professional fulfillment.
132;Some people think that computers are more of a hindrance than a help in today's society. Others believe that they are such indispensable tools that they would not be able to live or work without them. Discuss both opinions and give your opinion;Computer is a modern device that is useful for human life. People use computer particularly for work, study, even for communication. However, many people argue that computer more give obstacle than a help in social life. Other sides believe that it becomes prominent thing, and they cannot do anything without that device. However, I strongly believe that computer can influence society, and people's lives have already been controlled by device. I would argue that this modern device has been a major hindrance to some people. A study conducted by Mediabank shows that majority of Australian adults do not socialize with their families and friends as much as they used to, due to the fact that they spend almost nine hours a day dealing with computers as to produce efficient time in working. As it can be seen from the example, the idea that computers could be a help has been neglected.However, using computer can make people easier to complete their work. Businessmen, for example, use computer device to presentation or communication with their colleagues. Communication by feature-computer such as email and internet help busy businessmen to make deal with relation even in different country. This is due to using computer more efficient and, many workers cannot do more in work without computer.In conclusion, in era technology like this age, computer becomes important thing in human life. Every day, people cannot pass the day without stay in front of computer or using it. This situation becomes lifestyle habits, and nowadays human activities are influenced by computer use.;In contemporary society, the debate on the role of computers has become increasingly pronounced, with opinions diverging sharply. On one hand, some individuals argue that computers serve as more of a hindrance than a help. They contend that reliance on technology can lead to adverse effects, such as decreased face-to-face interactions, diminishing social skills, and an increase in distractions. For instance, students who are accustomed to multitasking on various devices may struggle to concentrate on their studies, hampering their academic performance. Furthermore, the prevalence of computers in the workplace can foster an unhealthy work-life balance, as the boundary between personal and professional spaces becomes blurred. Conversely, many believe that computers are indispensable tools that enhance productivity and improve quality of life. In the realm of work, computers streamline operations, allowing tasks to be completed more efficiently. They enable seamless communication across the globe, making remote work a viable option for many. Additionally, in education, computers provide access to a wealth of information and learning resources, empowering students to engage with material in ways that weren’t possible before. The ability to collaborate through online platforms fosters teamwork and innovation, showcasing how technology can elevate collective productivity.In my opinion, while it is essential to recognize the potential downsides of computer usage, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. Rather than viewing computers as hindrances, it is crucial to adapt our approaches to technology. This includes promoting digital literacy to ensure individuals can navigate the digital landscape healthily and productively. By harnessing the benefits while being mindful of the pitfalls, society can create a balanced relationship with computers, ultimately leading to personal and professional growth. Thus, rather than shunning technology, we should aim to integrate it thoughtfully into our daily lives.
133;Some employers are giving increased importance to social skills. However, others still believe qualifications are the most important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Ê;With the increased educational level of workforce, there are growing number of employers seeking criteria other than qualifications such as social skills in their employee selection process. However, some employers still believe that qualifications should be the most paramount criterion. The essay intends to explore both sides of arguments and also present my own opinion. Firstly, some people suggest that qualification should be the foremost measurement to determine the value of a employer. It is of importance that workers should be well educated and trained to perform duties of their job. Specifically, people who work in professional fields such as medicals are required to have a university degree and years of experience. Social skills seem to be less important as they cannot contribute to the success of a surgery. On the other hand, it is no doubt that the importance of social skills have been recognized by increasing number of employers. It is because people nowadays are required to work as a team in their jobs frequently. Interpersonal skill plays an essential role in helping colleagues to cooperate with each other, especially when conflicts arise. Better social skills allow them to resolve disagreements in a much more harmony way. Besides, organization have been transformed to customers oriented. Excellent social skills can help employees maintain strong relationship with their clients which thus lead to a better customer satisfaction.To my view, I incline to believe qualification is still the fundamental determinant of an employee's competency of their jobs. Yet, the importance of social skills should not be neglected as those skills can help one to perform their job effectiveness and efficiency by facilitating interaction and communication with others.;In the contemporary job market, the debate over the significance of social skills versus formal qualifications continues to gain prominence. On one hand, many employers emphasize social skills, recognizing that a candidate's ability to communicate effectively, work collaboratively, and adapt to various social situations is crucial in fostering a positive work environment. Social skills facilitate teamwork, enhance client relations, and contribute to a company's overall culture. In roles that require constant interaction, such as in sales or customer service, these interpersonal abilities can be as important, if not more so, than academic achievements.On the other hand, traditionalists argue that qualifications and technical skills remain the bedrock of professional success. Formal education and certifications are often seen as indicators of a candidate’s knowledge base, expertise, and ability to perform specific tasks. In fields such as engineering, medicine, and finance, advanced qualifications are essential to ensure that employees possess the necessary skills and knowledge to meet industry standards and regulations. Moreover, the increasing complexity of many jobs necessitates a solid educational foundation that can only be acquired through formal training.In my opinion, while qualifications are undoubtedly important, social skills should not be undervalued. The modern workplace is increasingly collaborative, demanding employees not only to execute their tasks proficiently but also to engage with others positively. A well-rounded employee who excels in both areas is more likely to contribute to an organization’s success. Therefore, rather than viewing qualifications and social skills as competing priorities, employers should adopt a more holistic approach when evaluating candidates. By valuing both the academic and interpersonal elements, companies can cultivate a workforce that is not only skilled but also adaptive and capable of thriving in dynamic environments.
134;Some people believe that charities should give aid to those who need the aid most, wherever they live. Some people believe that charity organisations would better concentrate on people in their own countries instead. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;The world has become more prosperous than ever yet a great number of people are still living in poverty or suffering by wars or disasters. Charity organisations have been playing an important role to provide support to those people. However, it is controversial whether the help should go to the people who need it most or the citizens of the country where the charity organisations are located. My view is that international aid should be prioritised.International aid is critical because people from other countries may be facing much more serious problems. Many people, for example in some African countries, are living below the basic standards. They lack food, water or clothes which keep them warm, not to mention the education needs. What is worse, people who live in countries that are confronted with wars or natural disasters are facing even more severe issues such as security, homelessness or the pain of losing best friends or family members. It is clear that those people are in desperate need of international support.Despite the importance of helping those beyond our national borders, it is reasonable to lend a hand to our fellow citizens. After all, charity organisations are mainly funded by the home country thus there is a high demand that the money should be spent in the place where it is collected. Another reason is that, even within the most developed countries, there are still poor people who lack their basic needs. By solving the problems in the home country, it is beneficial for social stability and steady economic growth.In conclusion, people from unfortunate countries need more international assistance while helping citizens in the home country is also necessary.;The debate surrounding the focus of charitable organizations—whether to direct aid to those in immediate proximity or to extend assistance globally—has been a contentious one. Proponents of global aid argue that the need for assistance should dictate the flow of resources, regardless of geographical boundaries. They emphasize that poverty and suffering exist in every corner of the world, and helping those who are most disadvantaged, irrespective of their location, fulfills a moral obligation. This perspective nurtures a sense of global solidarity and compassion, encouraging donors to recognize that crises, such as famine and conflict, transcend national borders. In an interconnected world, individuals are urged to see themselves as part of a global community, where help should be rendered based on need rather than nationality.Conversely, supporters of localized charity advocate for a focus on addressing issues within one's own country. This viewpoint holds that local charities are often better equipped to understand the social dynamics, cultural contexts, and specific needs of their communities. Local organizations may also foster trust and empowerment among beneficiaries, as they are inherently more familiar with the problems faced by their neighbors. Concentrating efforts on domestic needs can also stimulate local economies and drive community development, fostering a homegrown approach to solving social dilemmas.In my opinion, while both perspectives hold merit, charitable organizations should strive for a balanced approach. Global issues like climate change, pandemics, and displacement necessitate international collaboration, while local problems demand immediate attention. Charities can benefit from applying a dual strategy, wherein they raise awareness and funds for pressing international crises while simultaneously investing in their local communities. By doing so, they can ensure a more holistic approach to alleviating suffering, thereby fulfilling their mission effectively and ethically. In the end, the resolution of societal issues requires both local and global efforts, advocating for an integrated response to humanitarian needs.
135;Students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from others sources (such as the internet, television).To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The way in which children today study is radically different from any previous generations, and the increased availability and relatively low price of modern technology has been instrumental in this change. Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources, I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge.It is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students' acquisition of knowledge. Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields, and as the students answer these questions, the facts has been learned and reinforced. A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams, as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time. Moreover, when students have some academic problems, they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs. Besides, in the past, conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves, now all can be done at a click of a button. Thus, technologies are vital in students' learning.On the other hand, schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators. At schools, students' development has been orchestrated stage by stage, step by step by experienced teachers, and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way. Therefore, formal education approaches are also indispensable. To put it all in a nutshell, I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children's development. So students should learn both from their teachers as well as modern technology to gain the best learning outcome.;"The debate surrounding the effectiveness of learning from teachers compared to other sources, such as the internet and television, is significant in the realm of education. I strongly agree that students at schools and universities learn far more from lessons with teachers than from alternative resources.First and foremost, teachers provide structured learning experiences that are often tailored to the specific needs of their students. While the internet is a vast repository of information, it can be overwhelming and is often unfiltered. Teachers, on the other hand, curate content, presenting it in a coherent manner that aligns with curriculum goals. They are skilled in breaking down complex concepts, utilizing various teaching strategies that cater to diverse learning styles, ensuring that all students grasp the material effectively.Furthermore, lessons with teachers promote interactive learning, fostering engagement and critical thinking. In a classroom setting, students have the opportunity to ask questions, participate in discussions, and engage in collaborative projects. This dynamic interaction is often lacking in passive learning environments such as television or self-directed internet research, where feedback is minimal and students may not fully comprehend the material.Moreover, teachers do not merely deliver content; they also serve as role models and mentors. Their support and guidance can motivate students to pursue their interests and overcome academic challenges. The personal connection between teachers and students cultivates a supportive atmosphere that is essential for academic and emotional growth. This human element is something that digital platforms cannot replicate.In conclusion, while the internet and television can serve as supplementary resources, they lack the personalized, structured, and interactive qualities of teacher-led lessons. Therefore, I strongly believe that students benefit more from direct instruction and mentorship provided by teachers than from alternative sources. The combination of expertise, engagement, and personal connection that teachers offer is invaluable for student learning and success."
136;Popular events like the football World Cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"A world sportive competition event is watched by almost every country around the world and provide social stimulus and people gathering. However, while people view these sportive events as vital in release international problems, others think that they are just entertainment to distract people. I believe that they are important somehow, but not essential.As a matter of fact, world sport events provide positive waves for number of people. The main purpose of such competitions is to enjoy and share emotions between supporters though their favorite team. These emotions are shared locally in our village or city, nationally in our own country but even internationally too. Obviously these events gather people and their nationalist pride feeling is increased. For example, the football world cup taking place every four years is a very followed event during which everyone is having fun.Moreover, these sports events are not essential in other issues such as politics or other international affairs. Thus, if the general atmosphere during the show is peaceful and fraternal, the reality is different. In other words, this is the ""calm before the storm"". After the Olympics games are finished, everything came back to normal and all the game competition is forgotten by the majority. To picture it, recently, Putin was pleased to open the last winter Olympic games and gather international countries, but actually it has been just facade and Putin didn't listen international warning after he conquered the Crimea.Finally, an international sports event is a very good thing to gather people, let them dream, being proud of their nationality and forget problems, but just for a while. These meetings are in none case here to interact with international affairs.";International sporting events, such as the football World Cup, play a significant role in easing international tensions and allowing nations to express patriotic emotions in a constructive manner. I largely agree with this perspective for several reasons.First and foremost, these events serve as a global platform where nations come together, albeit in a competitive spirit. The football World Cup, for instance, draws viewers from around the world, creating a sense of shared experience that transcends political and cultural differences. The excitement surrounding these tournaments allows fans to channel their national pride positively, as they cheer on their teams in a festive atmosphere. This camaraderie fosters understanding and appreciation for different cultures, promoting a sense of global unity.Moreover, international sporting events often act as a temporary escape from geopolitical tensions. For example, during the Olympic Games, countries that may have contentious relations can momentarily set aside their differences and focus on the spirit of competition. The symbolism of athletes competing under the same banner can remind individuals of common goals, values, and aspirations—broadening the understanding that we are all part of a larger human endeavor.Additionally, sports provide an opportunity for dialogue through mutual interests. Fans from opposing sides often engage in friendly exchanges about the game itself, fostering a congenial atmosphere that can contribute to de-escalating misunderstandings. This kind of interaction humanizes competitors, reminding us that, at their core, individuals from different nations share similar hopes and dreams.In conclusion, while international sporting events may not resolve deep-rooted conflicts, they undeniably create an environment where international tensions can be eased, and national pride can be expressed healthily. Harnessing this energy for good can lead to positive interactions among nations, thereby contributing to a more peaceful world.
137;Many people use distance-learning programmes (study material post,TV,internet...)to study at home. But some people think that it cannot bring the benefit as much as attending college or university. Do you agree or disagree?;With the tremendous development in information technology, long-distance education enables people to study at home without going to school. Whether this teaching approach is more beneficial to pupils than the traditional way sparks off a heated debate. From my perspective, I agree with the view that students can acquire more benefits from the remote education.To begin with, studying at home save the pupils enormous time and considerable expense. Students who use distance-learning programs can cut down their commuting time, tuition fees, textbook fees and so forth just by an internet connection. This especially makes a significant difference for the children who live in the far-off countryside and the children whose families are living below the poverty-line.Besides that, long-distance education provides students the opportunity to access the immense knowledge resources and a variety of teaching approaches. Pupils can obtain materials for their curricula just by one mouse click, such as science reports, study posts, documentary records, etc. A student can even select a specific online course based on his own preference and time schedule so he can control the learning progress and make satisfactory achievement on this course.It is undeniable that traditional education has its advantages in face-to-face communication, mental inspiration and physical educations. These make remarkable contributions in providing immediate feedbacks and cultivating pupils' personalities. But with the improvements in streaming and sensor technologies, remote education can eliminate the obstacles of distance and body contacts.In conclusion, I concede that traditional education has some merits like feedbacks and inspirations that cannot be replaced in the near future. However, distance-learning outweighs the conventional way not only with its efficiency, convenience and economic value, but also with the self-regulated education that pupils can study on their own purpose.;In recent years, distance learning programs have gained immense popularity, largely due to their accessibility and flexibility. However, there remains a debate regarding their effectiveness compared to traditional college or university education. While both approaches have their merits, I contend that distance learning can provide substantial educational benefits, albeit with certain limitations.One of the primary advantages of distance learning is its accessibility. Students can learn at their own pace and schedule, which is particularly beneficial for those balancing work or family commitments. This flexibility allows individuals who may not otherwise have the opportunity to pursue higher education to do so. Moreover, with a wealth of resources available online—such as lectures, interactive materials, and discussion forums—students can tailor their learning experiences to suit their personal needs and preferences.Additionally, distance learning programs often incorporate cutting-edge technology that enhances the educational experience. With interactive platforms and multimedia content, students can enjoy a more dynamic learning environment, often leading to better retention of information. The global nature of online education also encourages diverse perspectives, allowing students to engage with peers from various backgrounds and cultures, enriching their overall learning.However, it is essential to recognize the limitations of distance learning. The lack of face-to-face interaction can hinder the development of interpersonal skills that are often cultivated in traditional settings. Moreover, students may find it challenging to stay motivated and disciplined without the structure of a physical classroom environment. Networking opportunities, mentorship, and the overall college experience are often cited as significant benefits of attending a university, which distance learning programs may not provide.In conclusion, while distance learning has its drawbacks, I believe it can offer significant educational benefits, especially for those unable to pursue traditional pathways. Ultimately, the choice between distance education and attending a university should depend on individual circumstances and learning preferences, as both avenues have unique strengths to offer.
138;There are many extinct species in the world nowadays. Some people say we should protect these animals from dying out, while others say we should concentrate more on problems of human beings. Discuss both opinions and give your personal view.;Many animals today are in danger of extinction owing to various reasons. While some people believe it is important to protect these endangered species, others argue that problems of human beings deserve more attention. In my opinion, we should give priority to our own issues.Animal protectionists may base their argument on the ground that biodiversity is essential to maintain the balance of ecosystem. If certain species are absent from this system, such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species, including human beings, will come under threat. Therefore, it is our responsibility to keep as many species on the Earth as possible.However, I think species extinction is quite natural according to the theory of evolution. The environment on the Earth has been transformed many times since the first species came into being. A great number of plants and animals died out because they were unable to fit into the new environment. On most occasions, the process of extinction of some species is irrevocable and we can do nothing about it.Furthermore, human beings nowadays are still faced with many urgent problems such as starvation, disease and wars. When these problems are taken into account, extinction of some animals recedes greatly in importance and it is not sensible to devote our limited resources to animals that have been past help. We should put our own survival and sustainment in order first before considering the conservation of other species.In conclusion, more emphasis should be laid on human beings other than animals, and it is better to let nature take its course with regard to species extinction.;"The extinction of numerous species has become a pressing issue in today’s world. The perspectives on how to address this problem vary significantly; some advocate for the protection of endangered animals, while others argue that human issues should take precedence. Both views warrant consideration, as the interplay between human existence and biodiversity is complex.Proponents of protecting endangered species argue that the loss of biodiversity poses a threat to ecological balance. Each species plays a specific role within its ecosystem, and their extinction can disrupt food chains and lead to further environmental degradation. Moreover, many endangered species provide significant benefits to humanity, including medicinal resources and ecological services, such as pollination and water purification. Protecting these species can also be seen as a moral obligation; humans have significantly contributed to their decline through habitat destruction, pollution, and climate change. Thus, safeguarding these animals is not only an ecological imperative but a matter of ethical responsibility.Conversely, those who prioritize human issues contend that resources and efforts should focus on pressing challenges such as poverty, health care, and education. They argue that addressing human needs should take precedence, as it directly impacts quality of life and societal stability. The argument often follows that while biodiversity is important, it should not overshadow the immediate concerns of human survival and development. Furthermore, some believe that as human populations continue to grow and expand, efforts to protect animal species may be seen as secondary to ensuring human well-being.In my view, both perspectives hold validity, but a balanced approach is essential. Sustainable development is key; it is possible to address human needs while protecting biodiversity. For instance, utilizing eco-friendly practices can ensure that conservation efforts benefit both people and wildlife. Ultimately, our survival is intertwined with the health of our environment, making it imperative to find a harmony between nurturing our species and preserving the ecological systems on which we all depend."
139;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;In today's context, education is the most significant factor which ultimately determines one's future. In my personal opinion, I am totally agreed with the view that there should not be any room for partiality in terms of gender while allocating seats for students in every university courses. There appear to be various reasons often strike in my mind in support of this position. To begin with, judging student's skills and abilities should only be based on their academic qualifications and talents rather than gender in particular. Nowadays, both male and female students are equally competitive to each other and deserve to produce impressive results in various field of education. In India, for example, female students are more often likely to grab more number of top scorer positions in every year higher secondary school examinations. Furthermore, female students are highly interested in learning courses such as mechanical engineering which demands physical activities in their lab workshops, unlike previous generation females. In addition, due to increasing exposure on current affairs and knowledge on cutting-edge technological developments, female graduates are more willing to take huge responsibilities in their workplace, despite its intensive stress and pressure. For example, Chanda Kochhar, who is the CEO of India's second largest bank called ICICI bank and prominently awarded as the country's most powerful female head in business sector. In conclusion, I am firmly supporting the view, that every student either male or female should be given fairly equal opportunity to purse their education in all university subjects, provided they should meet the required qualifications rather than putting limitations based on their gender. Government should take interim measures, to regulate admission process for university courses which enables every student to get benefit.;The debate over whether universities should enforce equal admission quotas for male and female students across all subjects is a complex and nuanced issue that warrants careful consideration. While the principle of gender equality is paramount, the implementation of such quotas raises a number of concerns that must be addressed.On one hand, advocating for equal representation in university admissions promotes gender equity and ensures that female students have the same opportunities as their male counterparts in fields where they have been historically underrepresented, such as engineering or computer science. This initiative could help dismantle enduring societal disparities and encourage diverse perspectives in academic and professional environments. By fostering a balanced atmosphere, universities can contribute to a society where both genders contribute equally to various disciplines, ultimately enhancing creativity and problem-solving capacities.Conversely, mandating equal numbers of male and female students in each subject may overlook the fundamental principle of meritocracy. Admissions should ideally be based on individual qualifications, interests, and capabilities rather than a strict adherence to gender parity. Imposing quotas might inadvertently dilute academic standards and undermine the achievements of students who have worked diligently to gain admission based on their merits. Moreover, certain subjects may naturally attract more one gender due to cultural, social, or individual preferences. Therefore, a rigid quota system could distort the natural distribution of interest across disciplines, perpetuating discontent among students who feel pressured to conform to arbitrary ratios rather than pursue their genuine passions.In conclusion, while striving for gender equity is essential, mandating equal numbers of male and female students in every subject may be an ineffective and counterproductive approach. A more beneficial strategy would involve fostering an inclusive environment that encourages all students to pursue their interests while simultaneously implementing supportive measures that increase participation of underrepresented genders in specific fields without compromising academic integrity.
140;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Face-to-face communication is better than other types of communication, such as letters, email, or telephone calls. Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether face-to-face communication is better than other kinds of communication, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that communication in person is the best way of expression, while others seem to stand on the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I agree that face-to-face communication is better. The first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that communicating in person can be more convincing. Sometimes, face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully, and a fitting example can be found from my uncle. He once complained a service of a restaurant. Without exaggeration, he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it. Afterward, my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication. If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone, I do not think this problem would be thought important. Therefore, we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way. Apart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally crucible aspect is that it is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication. For instance, I had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend, Eric. He said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore. I just shocked and did not know what happened. Finally, I realized that his facebook account was stolen. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face. Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that communication by letters, email, or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple, which is also one of the most important parts in communication. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. It is conceivable that before we talk, it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words. Talking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication; in contrast, it is usually detrimental to us. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I prefer to express my opinion in person because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I think the best way of communication is by means of face-to-face. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";"In the age of digital communication, the debate over whether face-to-face communication is superior to other methods, such as letters, emails, or telephone calls, is increasingly relevant. I firmly agree that face-to-face communication is better due to its immediacy, emotional depth, and ability to foster genuine connections.Firstly, face-to-face communication allows for immediate interaction and clarification. When engaging in real-time conversations, individuals can quickly address misunderstandings or questions. Non-verbal cues, such as body language and facial expressions, play integral roles in guiding the flow of conversation and ensuring that messages are conveyed accurately. For instance, a slight nod or a frown can give context to spoken words, enriching the dialogue in ways that emails or texts cannot replicate.Moreover, the emotional depth of face-to-face communication is unparalleled. Physical presence creates an atmosphere of intimacy and connection, fostering stronger relationships. When we converse in person, we share a space that transcends mere words, allowing us to experience empathy and understanding through shared humanity. Email or phone conversations can often feel impersonal; without visual or tactile elements, it’s easier to misinterpret emotions or intentions. Additionally, face-to-face interactions can lead to more fruitful brainstorming sessions and collaboration. When groups gather in person, the synergy of ideas flows more naturally. This immediacy can spark creativity and innovation that are sometimes stunted in slower, written communications.In conclusion, while digital methods of communication offer convenience, they often fall short of the richness, clarity, and emotional connection provided by face-to-face interactions. The ability to engage fully with another person in real time leads to better understanding, stronger relationships, and more effective collaboration. Thus, I advocate for greater emphasis on in-person communication in an increasingly virtual world."
141;One of the consequences of improved medical care is that people are living longer and life expectancy is increasing. Do you think the disadvantages of this development outweight the disadvantages?;Along with the development of technologies, advanced medical care has played an important role in the improvement of life expectancy. Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system, I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages.The main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health. They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity. In other words, they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost.In addition, a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society. In facts, young people will be happy as their parents, grandparents are healthy. It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people.On the other hand, some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system. Although it is real in some aspects, I believe that the capital that spend on taking care the elderly is contributed by these people during their working time, so they are worth to have good care. They have given their effort to the society so that young people, the governments have a responsibility to improve the Medicare system.By way of conclusion, it is true that the development of the health care system helps people have a better life. It helps people build a sustainable society where people can live a happy life when they are old.;The increase in life expectancy due to advancements in medical care is a noteworthy achievement, reflecting our progress in science and technology. However, it is crucial to analyze whether the disadvantages of this development outweigh the benefits. On one hand, the extension of life allows individuals to experience more of what life has to offer. With improved healthcare, many people enjoy healthier, longer lives, enabling them to pursue their passions, engage in lifelong learning, and spend more quality time with family. This not only enriches individual lives but also contributes to society by allowing older adults to share their knowledge and experience. Economically, an older and healthier workforce can bolster productivity, as seasoned employees often bring invaluable expertise.Conversely, extending life may lead to significant societal and economic challenges. The rising aging population places increasing pressure on healthcare systems and social services. As people live longer, they often face chronic health issues that require sustained medical attention, thereby straining resources. Moreover, pension systems may become unsustainable, with fewer workers supporting a growing number of retirees, leading to economic disparities and potential crisis situations in funding.Furthermore, there is a concern about the quality of extended life. Longevity does not automatically ensure a life free from suffering or disability. Many individuals may experience prolonged periods of decline, during which they require substantial care without adequate physical or mental wellbeing, raising ethical questions about end-of-life care and dignity.In conclusion, while improved medical care has undoubtedly contributed to longer lifespan opportunities, the potential disadvantages—such as economic strain on healthcare and pensions, alongside concerns for quality of life—pose significant challenges. Therefore, it is essential for society to adapt and innovate ways to ensure that longer lives are also healthier and more fulfilling, fostering a balance that acknowledges both the achievements and the challenges of increased life expectancy.
142;Successful people do something new or take risks rather than only doing something they know how to do well. AGREE OR DISAGREE.;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether successful people usually take risk or try new things, and the topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to believe that to be successful, they should do something they are unfamiliar with, while others seem to stand on the opposite place. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the latter; that is, successful people still do things they already know.The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that to be successful, we all try to reduce the risk we might encounter. The lower the factors making us fail we have, the higher probability to success we own. Consider a circumstance in which one person is rich because he knows a lot of knowledge of investment. He can focus on certain companies which he thinks is worth it to invest, and then just waits for the not so high but constant income. He does not have to invest some dangerous companies to get higher profit which might lead him to bankrupt in a short time. Therefore, we can commence to agree that successful people do not have to try new things or take risks.Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that it depends on the capability of one to decide whether he can succeed or not. At least, a successful person should be able to dismantle the hurdles prohibiting him to success. For instance, the sports stars do not have to take some drugs to win a game or show their extraordinary skills. The same reason why they succeed is that they all have the predominated abilities in sports realm. In contrast, those athletes try to have distinctive performance by taking risks of taking drugs are failed to succeed. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that it is not necessary for successful people to take risks.Admittedly, on the other hands, there might be some dissidents proclaiming that doing something new is necessary for people to success because they can become different from others, which is also a widely accepted idea for success. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. Try something new can indeed make people become special, while it does not mean successful. Based on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that doing what we already known can still leads us to succeed because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, reducing risks and enhancing individual's capability is the most important path to success. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I am firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my own sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";In today’s rapidly changing world, the notion that successful people often engage in new endeavors or take calculated risks rather than solely relying on their existing skills resonates deeply. I wholeheartedly agree with the assertion that venturing beyond familiar territories not only fosters personal growth but also paves the path to remarkable achievements.Firstly, taking risks is a fundamental aspect of innovation. Many of history’s greatest breakthroughs were the product of individuals who dared to step outside their comfort zones. For instance, Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple Inc., revolutionized technology by combining creativity with risk-taking, leading to the development of revolutionary products like the iPhone. Jobs' willingness to experiment and embrace uncertainty allowed him to create new markets and redefine consumer behaviors. Thus, it is evident that success is often the result of a willingness to explore uncharted territories.Moreover, engaging in new activities cultivates skills that are crucial in today’s competitive landscape. The ability to adapt and learn quickly is invaluable across various sectors. Individuals who limit themselves to what they already excel in may find their skills obsolete in the face of technological advancements and societal shifts. In contrast, those who take risks by trying out new roles or projects are more likely to develop a versatile skill set, making them more resilient in the workforce.Finally, stepping into the unknown fosters resilience and a growth mindset. Embracing failure as a learning opportunity encourages perseverance, a trait that successful people exemplify. Through trial and error, they gather valuable insights that can ultimately lead to greater success.In conclusion, the correlation between taking risks, exploring new avenues, and achieving success is undeniable. Embracing change and uncertainty not only drives innovation but also equips individuals with the necessary tools to thrive in an ever-evolving world. Thus, rather than simply relying on familiar skills, aspiring individuals should embrace new challenges as a pathway to success.
143;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;The purpose of education is always a controversial topic among people and society, especially in high level such as college or university. Some people think that all students should deserve to be educated at this level. However, in my opinion, it should be better to leave this type of type of training for a certain group of good, knowledgeable learners.First, focusing only on talented students is a better option because it helps academic institutions maintain their high education quality. Unlike middle school or high school, university and college require far a lot of ability and skills to keep up with an enormous amount of complex knowledge. In fact, some students may be capable in high schools, but the pressure of higher education is tough even for talented ones. That explains why it is only suitable for a limited people, and opening up for everyone will be fatal for institutions, since they need to somehow lower the materials so that it is practical for everyone.Secondly, university should only accept good students because it gives better human resources for sophisticated purposes. Some people argue that this may lead to 'social division', when someone with high education refuses to do the called 'low jobs', but actually it gives no harm to the whole community. Those standard jobs will always be available for everyone, while complex ones should be only handled by the best people, who start their career from the best institutions. I think limiting the number of people who can be admitted by universities is a good choice since it will reward the motivation of students and constantly keep them in the difficult level of learning, which makes them do the best to improve themselves. Ultimately, this improves the overall quality of education and gives the best people to serve in the most necessary needs of the society.To sum thing up, I agree that everyone should have a compulsory education level up to high school, but the above divisions should be only the realm of the best students. This will improve the quality of both universities and students, thus placing people in positions which suit them most.;The debate surrounding access to higher education has been a focal point in contemporary discourse, emphasizing the dichotomy between inclusive education and merit-based entry. On one side, proponents of universal access argue that every student, regardless of academic performance, should have the opportunity to pursue a college or university education. They contend that education is a fundamental right that can empower individuals, promote equality, and stimulate social mobility. This perspective views higher education as a tool for societal advancement and innovation, positing that diverse educational environments can lead to richer discussions and insights.In contrast, those who advocate for a meritocratic approach argue that higher education resources should be reserved for students who demonstrate academic excellence. They contend that this ensures that those who enter higher learning institutions are adequately prepared to handle the rigors of advanced study. This perspective prioritizes the quality of education, suggesting that maintaining high standards is essential for the integrity of academic institutions and the value of the degrees they confer.While both viewpoints have merit, I align more closely with the belief that higher education should be accessible to all students. Education plays a critical role in nurturing potential, and lowering barriers to entry can lead to unexpected revelations and innovations from those who may not fit traditional academic molds. Furthermore, not all students exhibit their capabilities within standard testing or grading systems. By enabling a broader range of students to access higher education, society can tap into various talents and perspectives that would otherwise remain untapped.In conclusion, the equitable availability of higher education fosters an inclusive society where individuals can contribute to the collective knowledge and progress of humanity. While academic standards are important, creating avenues for access can ultimately lead to a more informed and innovative society, benefiting all.
144;Agree or disagree? Universities spend money on improving facilities (labs and general requirements) better than hiring famous teachers.Ê;"There is a hotly debated issue over whether universities should spend money on improving facilities is more than hiring famous teachers, and this topic can be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to prefer that schools should invest in renewing facilities, while other seem to believe that famous teachers is more conducive to students. After deeply pondering over this issue, I develop my own perspective as well. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to spend money on improving facilities. The first and foremost reason lies in an inevitable fact that the more advanced facilities we have, the more chances we can increase our knowledge. For example, library is a good place for students to study or research. They can concentrate on the subjects with a tranquil ambience; also, there are a lot of references for students to utilize. With this convenient and versatile facility, students can improve their learning condition. Therefore, we can commence to agree that certain facilities are beneficial to students. Moreover, another equally crucial aspect is that students are not always staying in classrooms. They have numerous activities in school. Consider a circumstance in which a student who is a member of jazz ensemble in their school. He must need a better auditorium for him to have an extraordinary performance. With this distinguished performance, the student would acquire an unforgettable and valuable experience burring deeply in his mind. Hence, from this case, we are capable of stating that students would prefer school to spending on improving facilities.Admittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that schools should spend money on hiring prestigious teachers because they can impart their students well. However, according to my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying owing to its imprudence. A student is good or not do not depend on whether he has a good teacher but is decided by his effort on study. It is useless to hire a super famous teacher to teach those who behaviors as sluggards. Based on the reasons demonstrate above, I believe that improving facilities is the best way for school because the advantages of this are relatively greater than that of the other. In other words, students can procure more advantages from better facilities. It is not to say, of course, that other points of view are completely without merit. Still, I an firmly convinced that the reasons I have proposed in favor of my sentiment are much more tenable and cogent.";The question of whether universities should prioritize spending on improving facilities over hiring renowned teachers is a nuanced one, and my stance leans towards agreeing that better facilities can often provide a more substantial benefit to the university experience than hiring well-known faculty.Improving facilities, particularly in fields that rely heavily on practical applications, can significantly enhance the educational experience. Modern labs equipped with the latest technology allow students to engage in hands-on learning, promoting a deeper understanding of their subjects. Access to state-of-the-art resources, such as advanced software, specialized equipment, or contemporary study spaces, can create an immersive environment that fosters innovation and creativity. When students have the necessary tools at their disposal, they are more likely to succeed academically and prepare effectively for their future careers.Moreover, well-maintained and advanced facilities can attract a diverse range of students who may seek out those resources for their education. Even the best teachers may struggle to provide a top-notch educational experience without adequate resources. Investment in facilities can have a ripple effect, uplifting the overall institution's reputation and leading to improved student outcomes, thereby attracting additional talent, both in terms of students and faculty.On the other hand, while prominent faculty members can certainly enrich a university's reputation and bring valuable perspectives, their effectiveness is often contingent on the environment in which they teach. A highly regarded teacher may not perform to their fullest potential if they are limited by outdated infrastructure or poorly maintained facilities.In conclusion, while both faculty and facilities are crucial to a university's success, the enhancement of educational infrastructure can offer more significant long-term advantages. By prioritizing investments in modern facilities, universities can create enriching learning environments that ultimately benefit students, faculty, and the institution as a whole.
145;Do you agree or dis agree with the following statement? High schools should allow students to study the courses that students want to study. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Some people state that high schools should allow students to study what they want to. They believe this motivates students to study. I think, however, students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics. I believe that tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university. In addition, it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles.To begin with, students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested. They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects, otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject. For instance, a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field.Next, students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields. General education plays a significant role in specialized education. Science today, for example, is said to be more and more specialized, but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics. In addition, although textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects, in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects. For instance, you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry. Therefore, high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university.Last but not least, students have tendency to shun difficulties. They might avoid tough courses, but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much. This might result in limited choices in the future. Therefore, schools should be responsible for their future and protect them.In summary, students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education. Besides, high school must be responsible for their future with well-planned curriculum.;I strongly agree that high schools should allow students to study the courses they want to study. Empowering students to choose their education paths fosters a sense of ownership over their learning, cultivates passion, and promotes greater academic engagement.Firstly, allowing students to select their courses encourages them to take ownership of their education. When students have the freedom to choose subjects that interest them, they are more likely to feel motivated and dedicated to their studies. For instance, a student interested in the arts might thrive in an environment where they can choose classes like painting or graphic design over traditional subjects that do not resonate with their passions. This autonomy not only enhances their educational experience but also prepares them for future decision-making in higher education and careers.Moreover, choice in education allows students to cultivate their passions and develop a more profound understanding of subjects they care about. A student with a keen interest in technology could opt for coding or robotics classes, which would help them build skills that align with their career aspirations. By focusing on personalized interests, students can explore and deepen their knowledge in areas that excite them, potentially leading to innovations and advancements in those fields.Additionally, when students are given the opportunity to choose their courses, they tend to engage more actively in their studies, resulting in higher academic achievement. Research has shown that students who are invested in their coursework are more likely to put in the effort required to succeed, leading to improved grades and better overall performance.In conclusion, allowing high school students the freedom to study courses of their choice is essential for fostering a more engaging, personalized, and motivational educational environment. By empowering students to pursue their interests, we prepare them for future success and help them become passionate, lifelong learners.
146;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Games are as important for adults as they are for children. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As people grow up, the arguments about the importance of games arise. Some people think that, adults need playing games as children do. However, in my opinion, games are no longer too important for them for several reasons.The first reason is that games become unnecessary for people when their careers begin. Someone may argue that games help adults relax and become more balanced in life. But, more often, the pressure of work and family commitment force them to abandon their lifelong hobbies, and as a result, they cannot spend enough time and effort to their favorite games as they did in 15 or 20 years ago. For example, in my country, except for a minor part of professional athletes, the majority of people stop playing games seriously as soon as they find a decent job. They often feel that such games become more troublesome than enjoyable for their daily lives.Another reason should be mentioned is that adults often do not pursue games as a competitive activity, while children are always keen on competition and winning. For youngsters, maintaining their desire to win often develops many outstanding characteristics whether they participate sport events or not. For example, my younger sister likes fencing, and thanks to her desire to win, she never gives up when facing a difficult situation, or even becoming hurt. On the other hand, adults often consider such behaviors as childish and drop them immediately. In fact, a competitive person usually finds it difficult to cooperate with friends and colleagues. Because of that, they no longer play games for any moderate achievements, and gradually lose their interest in such activities.To sum up, I think adults do need to play games, but their styles are often distinct from children's, which are often less competitive and more enjoyable. Along with the high requirement for family and work, games are just some leisure activities for adults, not something necessary as they are meant to be for children.;Games are often perceived as activities reserved for children, yet I strongly agree that they hold equal importance for adults. Engaging in games offers numerous benefits that extend beyond mere entertainment, fostering mental well-being, social interactions, and cognitive skills that are essential in adulthood.Firstly, games serve as a significant outlet for stress relief, providing adults with a much-needed escape from the pressures of everyday life. In a world increasingly filled with responsibilities and challenges, adults face high levels of stress and anxiety. Participating in games—whether they be video games, board games, or sports—can facilitate relaxation and help individuals unwind. For example, studies have shown that playing video games can lead to decreased anxiety levels and enhanced mood, allowing adults to recharge mentally.Furthermore, games encourage social interaction, which is fundamental for a healthy lifestyle. In today's digital age, where many adults may feel isolated due to busy work schedules, games create opportunities for connection. Online multiplayer games allow friends and family to bond over shared interests, while traditional board games facilitate face-to-face interactions, strengthening relationships. These shared experiences promote teamwork and communication skills that are vital both in personal and professional settings.Additionally, games can enhance cognitive abilities. Many games require strategic thinking, problem-solving, and quick decision-making, skills that are highly beneficial in both career advancement and everyday life. For instance, engaging in complex strategy games helps sharpen critical thinking and analytical skills, enabling players to approach real-life challenges more effectively.In conclusion, games should not be seen as trivial pursuits exclusive to children. They offer significant benefits to adults, including stress relief, enhanced social connections, and improved cognitive skills. Thus, it is essential for adults to recognize the value of gaming as a vital component of a balanced life.
147;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Modern technology is creating a single world culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"There are many different opinions regarding world culture. Some people think that all the countries in the world cannot have a single culture. However, in my view, a single modern culture is being created by modern technology for the following reasons.Firstly, most of the countries have the same educational system based on technology. Teachers give topics to the students who should research on the internet to find data, and then students should type their research by using computer and even give a presentation by using PowerPoint. For example, students who are studying in Iran use the same software, Microsoft, to type their homework or have presentation compared to Canadian students.Secondly, new technology has created some similar jobs all around the world. Computer technology is a growing job in most of the countries, and students are being encouraged to study in this field. For example, many immigrants in Canada who have the degree in computer technology fields can easily go to Canadian universities and find jobs with good salaries. This example shows that jobs that are related to technology are in demand in most of the countries.Some people might argue that there are some cultures such as making foods which are unicq in each culture, and technology cannot affect them. This point has some merits on the surface; however, many countries such as Canada, the USA, and British have many restaurants which serve many foods form different countries and cultures. In fact, cooks can find many new food recipes easily on the Internet. For example, two days ago, I went to a Canadian restaurant, and I ate noodle, sushi, which are Chinese foods, and Greek salad.To sum up, new technology has affected cultures of the world, and we can see many similarities in many cultures. In fact, new technology has influences on educational system, jobs and foods in the world.";In today’s interconnected world, modern technology has indeed played a pivotal role in fostering a single global culture, although there are complexities that must be acknowledged. I agree with the contention that technology is creating a unified cultural landscape, primarily through the rise of the internet, social media, and global communication.Firstly, the internet serves as a powerful tool for cultural exchange, allowing individuals from diverse backgrounds to share their ideas, traditions, and lifestyles with one another. Platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram enable users to access and engage with content from around the globe. For instance, popular music genres like K-pop have transcended their local roots to gain international recognition, paving the way for a shared listening experience that defies geographical barriers. This phenomenon not only promotes a singular musical taste but also encourages the blending of cultural influences, leading to hybrid forms of artistic expression.Secondly, social media plays a crucial role in unifying cultural narratives and values. Global movements such as climate change activism and social justice campaigns often gain momentum through hashtags that resonate worldwide. This connectivity allows for a consolidated voice that can challenge local norms and inspire collective action—demonstrating how modern technology can reshape cultural paradigms.However, one must also consider that while technology may foster a global culture, it does not eliminate local cultures. Instead, it often catalyzes a dialogue between the global and the local, encouraging individuals to negotiate their identities in new ways. Traditional customs may be preserved, but they are increasingly influenced by global cultural trends.In conclusion, modern technology undeniably propels the emergence of a single world culture by facilitating cross-cultural interactions and shared experiences. While this trend may pose challenges to cultural diversity, it also provides opportunities for enriched dialogue and understanding among various cultures.
148;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Nowadays it is much easier to achieve success with the help from one's family than what is like before;There are many factors that contribute to one's success. However, which factor is the most influential one is open to debate. Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one's success. It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family. I agree with this statement. In my opinion, family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success. There are a couple of reasons.First of all, more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university. Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did, they can provide more advices and helps in our career. In the past, seldom people have the chance to attend a collage. For example, my grandparents did not get a education even in high school, so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood, he had to go to his teacher for help. Things have changed a lot. I grow up in a better condition than my father did. Whenever I have problems, I can always ask my parents for help. They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot. What is more, family members can help us in many other aspects. For example, when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university, my father told a lot about different majors. He shared his own experience with me, which helped me quite a lot. Parents are quite experienced than their child, they can guide them toward the right direction. Besides, parents can told their children as many as they can. What they want is help their child to make a progress.In a word, our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life. I believe that with the help of our family, we can achieve success quite easily.;In today’s world, the assertion that it is much easier to achieve success with the help of one's family carries significant merit. While familial support has always played a crucial role in individual achievements, the nature and scope of that support have transformed dramatically over time, making it more accessible and impactful.Firstly, modern communication technologies have revolutionized how families interact. In the past, geographical distance often separated family members, limiting the possibilities for guidance and support. Today, with instant messaging, video calls, and social media, family members can provide encouragement and advice from afar. Such accessibility enables individuals to tap into their family’s experiences and wisdom at critical junctures in their personal and professional lives.Moreover, the structure of modern families has evolved to incorporate more collaborative and supportive dynamics. Many families prioritize education and personal development, emphasizing the importance of pursuing passions and goals. Parents today often invest time and resources into their children’s skills, whether through tutoring, mentorship, or emotional encouragement, laying a strong foundation for success.Additionally, the concept of success has shifted, embracing a broader range of aspirations including mental well-being, fulfillment, and happiness. Families now recognize that success is not solely linked to financial achievement but also encompasses personal growth and life satisfaction. This more holistic understanding allows families to nurture a supportive environment that encourages pursuing diverse aspirations, thus enhancing their members' chances of success.However, it is essential to acknowledge that not all families are equipped to provide this support. Societal and economic disparities still exist, which can limit a family's ability to aid their members. Nevertheless, for those who have supportive familial networks, the resources and encouragement available today provide a significant advantage in the pursuit of success, making it arguably easier than in previous generations. In conclusion, the modern family plays a pivotal role in fostering success, advocating for and supporting individuals in ways that are more holistic and accessible than ever before.
149;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Reading fiction (such as novels and short stories) is more enjoyable than watching movies. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;"There are many different opinions regarding hobbies. Some people would rather watch TV. However, in my view, reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies for the following reasons.Firstly, fiction books pay more attention to details. In fact, we can know characters, places, and times of a novel very well during reading it. Most of the novels describe not only main characters but also other people in the novels, where each scene is happening. For example, after I read animal farms which is a story of Russian revolution, I could understand the leaders and different segments of the Russian people. However, a movie just gives us a very small review of its stories and characters.Secondly, reading a novel is more convenient. Some novels have around 100 pages and readers cannot finish them in just one hour. Yet these people can continue to read their novels wherever they find free time such as in bus or trains. For example, I have started to read a novel since last week. I do not have enough time to read a novel in one day, so I usually read it when I am coming home from English class. In contrast, I cannot watch a complete movie because I can just sit in front of TV for 15 minutes and after that, I have to study.Some people might argue that people enjoy watching TV when they know they can learn many things such as learning a language by watching movies. This point has some merits on the surface; however, movies are not a good idea to learn a language for beginners since characters in movies speak very fast and unclear for language learners. For these learners it is better to start by reading some novels which are more comprehensible and enjoyable.To sum up, reading fictions is more pleasant because these books have more depth, are much easier to use, and more useful for language learners.";"The debate between the enjoyment of reading fiction versus watching movies has long captivated audiences, and I firmly align myself with the perspective that reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching films. While both mediums offer their own unique forms of storytelling, the immersive experience provided by literature often surpasses that of cinema.One of the primary reasons I favor reading fiction is the depth and richness that literature affords. When reading a novel, readers can engage in the intricate details of a character's thoughts, emotions, and motivations. This internal dialogue allows for a more profound connection with the characters, which is often lost in movie adaptations that prioritize visual storytelling over psychological depth. For example, in novels like ""Pride and Prejudice"" by Jane Austen, readers can intimately understand Elizabeth Bennet’s evolving feelings towards Mr. Darcy, an experience that is often simplified in screen adaptations.Moreover, reading exercises the imagination in ways that watching films cannot. When engaged in a fictional narrative, readers must visualize settings, fabricate characters’ appearances, and synthesize their own interpretations of the story. This creative process fosters cognitive engagement and personal reflection. In contrast, movies provide a passive experience where visuals are dictated by the director’s vision, potentially hindering one’s imaginative participation.Additionally, the act of reading allows for unique pacing tailored by the individual reader. Whether choosing to linger on a particularly poignant passage or racing through an exciting chapter, readers have the autonomy to shape their experience. Movies, conversely, adhere to the director's pacing, which can either rush critical moments or elongate scenes unnecessarily.In conclusion, while both literature and cinema have their merits, reading fiction provides a more enriching and enjoyable experience through its depth, imaginative engagement, and personal pacing. Embracing the world of novels and short stories not only cultivates a love for storytelling but also enhances our ability to empathize and think critically, making it a more fulfilling pursuit overall."
150;Several languages die every year. Many people feel this is a positive trend and that a world with fewer language promotes harmony and understanding between people. Analyze both sides of this argument and provide your opinion.;"Today, English is commonly used language across the world. Its usage is increasing day by day. As a consequence, various local languages are becoming extinct. Some people argue that, this is a positive change and would help people to easily communicate. While there are others who disagree with this and are more concerned about dying local languages. In my opinion, I believe using single language through out the world is a positive change which is helping the world to become a better place to live.A world with fewer languages helps us interact with each other in a better way. Due to globalization, many people are traveling for professional trips. So, communicating in single language will reduce the problems of travelers in daily activities like ordering food in a restaurant or in going around places. Furthermore, students who migrate for better education would not have to go through lot of stress as they can easily make new friends and can be part of any discussions which is otherwise not possible in a world with multiple languages; this in turn makes it easy to adjust in new environment. Single language also reduces misunderstandings between people. Adding to that, exchange of knowledge in different sectors of research like electronics, medical, astronomy etc would become easier.On the other hand, few people are worried about the dying local languages. These languages are the basis for the origination and initial communication between different cultures. They represent local culture. As the usage of these languages decrease, culture also changes accordingly. Further, these languages are tightly coupled with history; all the olden day literature and scripts will be impossible to decipher if these languages are lost.To conclude, I believe change is inevitable and that usage of one language across the world is a positive one. We have to accept these changes for a world to be a better place. Communication in single language would improve the productivity of the world and brings everyone on to the same page.";The phenomenon of language extinction has garnered considerable debate in recent years, with opinions sharply divided on whether the loss of languages is ultimately beneficial or detrimental to global society. Proponents of language extinction argue that a world with fewer languages can lead to enhanced communication and understanding among people. In an increasingly interconnected world, a common language can facilitate international relations, business, and cooperation across various domains. The argument is that when individuals share a common means of communication, misunderstandings and misinterpretations may be minimized, thereby fostering a sense of global unity and harmony.Conversely, opponents of this perspective highlight the critical cultural and intellectual losses that result from the extinction of languages. Every language encapsulates a unique worldview, history, tradition, and identity that contributes to the rich tapestry of human diversity. When a language dies, an entire body of knowledge and cultural heritage is at risk of vanishing. Indigenous languages, in particular, contain invaluable wisdom about ecosystems, medicine, and social practices, which are often not documented elsewhere. Hence, language diversity enriches humanity's collective experience, offering various ways of perceiving and interacting with the world.From my point of view, while the efficiency of communication in a common language is appealing, the loss of linguistic diversity poses a more significant threat to cultural richness and human experience. The extinction of languages signifies not merely a reduction in communication methods but the erasure of invaluable cultural identities and histories. Efforts should be made to promote multilingualism and preserve endangered languages instead of embracing their extinction. Supporting linguistic diversity can lead to a deeper understanding and appreciation of different cultures, ultimately fostering true harmony that transcends mere communication. In conclusion, the preservation of languages is critical for maintaining cultural heritage and promoting a truly inclusive global society.
151;Elderly people think that the way they spent their life was simpler and better than today. Do you agree or disagree? Provide you reasons and real life example;Changes are inseparable parts of this world which normally humans are responsible for by manipulating the environment they live in. Sometimes these changes adversely affect our lives that make elderly people think they used to live in a better world than the modern world the younger generation are experiencing. I utterly disagree with this opinion due to technological and medical reasons.We live in an era that technology is developing in the speed of light, steering the world toward a much more convenient place. A clear-cut example that supports this idea is the invention of smart phones. The strong navigation system installed on the phones has been rescued lives of many who left alone in remote areas like forests or deserts. Moreover, some people criticize social networks as tools that have ruined true relationships and friendships by reducing face-to-face communication. In my opinion though, social networks such as Facebook could foster the ties between friends and family members who are obligatorily far away from each other by keeping them in touch, the thing that was impossible less than 20 years ago. The phenomenal progress in medical science in the last decade was a huge achievement for human being to make the world a healthier and, thus, a happier place to live in. Today, even some disabled people with serious vertebral injuries can start doing physical activities like walking again thanks to the continuingly efforts of biomechanical engineers and neurologists. The advancement in drug delivery systems is another example that could save lives. To be specific, scientists could invent ways to lead drugs directly to the damaged organs of the body, which is a miraculous breakthrough. In general, the increase in the average age of human from 50 to around 75 years through last decades is a strong evidence to show how successful human was in medicine.In conclusion, even though the people from older generation may claim they had better life as there were stronger bonds between family members and friends, I think they are wrong, since they judge the contemporary age through a personal prejudice. In light of the above-mentioned facts, one can easily conclude that in the current world living standards stand in a much higher level and people are in better conditions socially and physically.;The perception of simplicity in the lives of the elderly compared to the complexities of modern life is a prevalent sentiment in many societies. While there are valid points in advocating for the notion that life was simpler and arguably better in the past, I believe this perspective can be overly romanticized and does not take into account significant advancements and challenges that have occurred.One of the primary reasons elderly individuals might consider their past as better is the slower pace of life. For instance, in previous decades, communication occurred via face-to-face interactions, letters, or landline telephones, which fostered deeper connections and a greater emphasis on community. Many retirees often recall the warmth of neighborhood gatherings and less rushed lifestyles. This awareness of time spent with family and friends contrasts starkly with the fast-paced digital age that bombards us with information and distractions.However, this portrayal of the past often overlooks the various hardships that defined those times. For example, the lack of medical advancements resulted in higher mortality rates and limited access to healthcare. Diseases that are now easily preventable or treatable, like polio or tuberculosis, could devastate communities. Moreover, societal expectations and norms led to significant inequalities, particularly for marginalized groups, which many elderly individuals faced firsthand. While nostalgia can evoke positive memories of simpler times, it is crucial to recognize the progress we have made. Modern conveniences such as advanced healthcare, access to information, global connectivity, and improved living standards have significantly enhanced the quality of life for many. Thus, rather than viewing the past as unequivocally better, it can be more beneficial to appreciate both the advantages of modern life and the lessons learned from the past. This approach encourages a balanced perception, acknowledging the complexities of both eras while embracing the progress of human society.
152;Some people say that all secondary school and higher school students should be taught how to manage money as its an important life skill. Do you agree or disagree with this argument?;There is no doubt that money has become key ingredient in various walks of our life than before. Teaching financial management to juvenile students is always a topic of debate. Some people feel that teaching money management skill to teenage students will help them realise the importance of money, while few feel that exposing children to money math at this age may turn fatal. In my view, I agree to that fact that higher school students should be made aware of the money management.The reason why I think teenage students need to understand the money management basics is, primarily when secondary school students attain the age of undergoing graduation, students ought to stay in hostels or with friends and away from family, during such situations when money management is taught at an early age students will have increased sense of responsibility and confidence. For example, while I was a kid my father used to maintain expense log for the month, I was asked to do the same for my keep track of my pocket money expenses, during my future course of life this became a practice and helped me in planning my expenses.In addition, if financial management is taught at an early age, students will have better sense of understanding of their family financial background and status, students coming up with unrealistic whims and fancies are minimized. For example, buying a gaming console may not be a big deal for a student from an affluent financial background. However, for a student coming from middle class buying a gaming console may not be the need of the hour. Hence, having exposed to money management at a high school level will help them in prioritizing the financial commitments efficiently.In conclusion, I think students understanding the money management techniques will have more positive effects than negative impact. However, the teaching should be in a constructive manner and students should not feel that they are being bullied for every expense.;In today’s fast-paced and increasingly complex financial landscape, the debate over whether students in secondary and higher education should be taught money management is both relevant and significant. I firmly agree that equipping students with practical financial skills is essential for their future success and well-being.Firstly, financial literacy is an indispensable life skill that empowers individuals to make informed decisions regarding their finances. As young people transition into adulthood, they often encounter various financial responsibilities such as budgeting, saving, and investing. Without solid foundational knowledge, they may struggle with avoiding debt, managing expenses, or making wise investment choices. Teaching money management in schools can significantly reduce the risk of financial missteps that could lead to long-term consequences, such as crippling debt or poor credit ratings.Secondly, incorporating financial education into the school curriculum prepares students for real-world challenges. In an era where student loans and credit card debt are prevalent, understanding concepts like interest rates, inflation, and the importance of saving is critical. Financial literacy programs can help demystify these topics, allowing students to navigate their financial futures with confidence. Moreover, the earlier a person begins to develop good financial habits, the more likely they are to maintain them into adulthood.Finally, teaching money management can also promote social equity. Young people from diverse socio-economic backgrounds often have varying levels of access to financial knowledge. By providing all students with a standard curriculum on money management, schools can help level the playing field, ensuring that every individual has the tools to achieve financial stability and success, regardless of their background.In conclusion, integrating money management education into secondary and higher education is vital. It not only equips students with essential life skills, prepares them for the realities of adult financial responsibilities, and promotes social equity, but it also fosters a generation that is financially literate and capable of making sound economic decisions.
153;Some single people like to live with a roommate, while others prefer to live alone. Which would you prefer? Give specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many single people have difficulties deciding whether to live with a roommate or to live alone. Each makes different decisions. Some people choose to live alone for privacy, while others choose to live with a roommate for practical reasons. As far as I am concerned, I prefer to live with a roommate. This is because it saves me money, enables me to socialize, and allows me to get help.Living with a roommate saves me a lot of money. If you have roommates, you can split the rent and utilities among them. This means you can get more for less. For example, last year, I shared a room off-campus with my friend, and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half: I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating, and two hundred dollars for rent monthly. I was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills.Apart from saving a lot of money, living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily. It is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you. You can invite your roommates' friends over to your room and have fun together. For instance, one night, my roommate, Millan, brought his friends along. Even though his friends and I were total strangers to each other, we quickly got to know each other. We soon found out that everyone loved playing video games. We played a video game called 'Halo' together all night, and became good friends. Living with a roommate made socializing much easier for me.Finally, living with a roommate allows me to get help. It often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need. When you run into a problem, you can ask your roommates if they can help. Some of them may have something to offer. To illustrate, when my computer mysteriously broke down, I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help. They failed to give me any useful solutions. To my surprise, one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help. He was very good with computers, and he managed to fix the problem quickly.In conclusion, while many people decide to live alone for various reasons, I prefer to live with a roommate, and I always will. This is because it offers me many advantages, such as less spending, more socializing, and more help. I think single people should live with a roommate, if they want to enjoy their lives.;The decision to live alone or with a roommate is a significant one for many single people, each option presenting its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Personally, I would prefer to live alone, and my reasons stem from the desire for independence, personal space, and the ability to create my ideal living environment.First and foremost, living alone grants a level of independence that is hard to achieve when sharing a space. I value the autonomy to make my own decisions regarding my schedule, social life, and household routines without the need for compromise. For instance, I can choose to have friends over late at night or pursue hobbies without worrying about disturbing anyone. This sense of freedom allows me to cultivate a lifestyle that aligns with my personal priorities and preferences.Moreover, having personal space is incredibly important to me. Living alone means I have complete control over my living environment, from the organization of furniture to the choice of décor. I can create a sanctuary that reflects my individuality and values, which can be incredibly fulfilling. For example, I can maintain a quiet atmosphere ideal for study or relaxation, free from distractions that might arise from a roommate's activities or preferences.Additionally, living alone encourages self-reliance and personal growth. It forces me to manage my finances, handle chores, and solve problems independently, fostering a sense of responsibility that enhances my maturity. While socializing with roommates can be enjoyable, the solitude of living alone provides invaluable time for self-reflection and personal development.In conclusion, while sharing a living space with a roommate can foster companionship and reduce housing costs, I prefer the independence, control over my environment, and personal growth opportunities that come with living alone. This choice allows me to fully embrace my individuality and cultivate a lifestyle that resonates with me.
154;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be permitted in restaurants, and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld.;Generally speaking, smoking is never been good for human's body. There are so many researches done to prove that a cigar contains harmful ingredients for human's body. Although many smokers claim that they need to smoke in order to work more effectively or to think more creatively, those reasons never proves that smoking has any benefits for human's body. In my opinion, smoking should not be permitted, especially in public places like restaurants because it will make the non-smokers breathe uncomfortably.First of all, restaurants are places where people come and pay some money to enjoy their meals. Smoking in restaurants will absolutely disturb other people in enjoying their meals. They will not be able to enjoy their meals while breathing in smoke around them. Secondly, restaurants are places that people usually come with their families. This means, there will be children, grandparents, as well as pregnant women inside the restaurants. Smoking in restaurants can give a bad example to the children. Children have a high potential to imitate what adults do because they have really high curiosity towards something. Smoking in restaurants also can affect the elders' health, especially if they have problems with their hearts and lungs. The most dangerous people that would be affected by smoke are the pregnant women because they will breathe in the contaminated air and it will disrupt the growth of the babies.Last but not least, passive smokers will have a lot of health risks. When they are around the active smokers, they will inhale hazardous smoke. Stroke, heart disorders, hearing loss, and cancers are some diseases that can attack passive smokers. Personally speaking, it is unfair for passive smokers because they do not smoke but they have same health risks as the active one.In conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants because there will be a lot of people get disadvantaged. State laws that prohibit it should be upheld so the restaurant' management can make a clear rule in their restaurants because everyone has a right to enjoy their meals.;"The debate surrounding smoking in public places, particularly in restaurants, has become increasingly relevant in recent decades. I firmly agree that smoking should not be permitted in restaurants, and I support the enforcement of state laws that prohibit it. This stance derives from considerations of public health, environmental quality, and the fundamental rights of individuals.First and foremost, smoking poses significant health risks, not only to smokers but also to non-smokers exposed to secondhand smoke. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), secondhand smoke contains over 7,000 chemicals, many of which are toxic and can lead to serious health issues, including respiratory diseases and cancer. In a restaurant setting, where people gather to enjoy meals and socialize, the presence of smoke can create an unhealthy environment that undermines the public's well-being. Laws that prohibit smoking in these venues are essential for protecting patrons and employees from the detrimental effects of secondhand smoke.Moreover, the enforcement of such laws contributes to a more pleasant dining experience. Many diners prefer to enjoy their meals in a clean, smoke-free space. Restaurants that maintain non-smoking policies often attract more customers, as they cater to the growing demographic that values health and comfort. This creates a win-win situation; establishments can boost their revenue while prioritizing the health of their guests.Finally, supporting laws that ban smoking aligns with a broader social movement towards healthier lifestyles. As society becomes more aware of the health implications associated with smoking, it is crucial for legislation to reflect these values. Upholding state laws prohibiting smoking in restaurants is a necessary step towards promoting a culture of health awareness and responsibility.In conclusion, I strongly believe that smoking should be banned in restaurants, bolstered by state laws that protect the health and well-being of the community. We must prioritize public health and ensure that dining spaces are safe and enjoyable for everyone."
155;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Growing violence in films has affected youngsters in a negative way?;It's obvious that violent behavior is growing more in films in recent 20 years. This matter has been considered as a way to advertise a film. From my point of view, I believe that violence in movies has negative effects on youngsters mostly on their behaviors, emotions & study.In the first place, children behaviors are the most concerning matter which parents are always trying to do their best. Nowadays children are more involved in TV programs. Imagine an actor who is a child’s favorite is doing violent roles. In this case, the child would imitate the actor's behaviors in order to look like to him. Thus, unexpectedly the violent behavior has effected on child’s behaviors.Meanwhile, human beings are very sensitive, especially of youngsters. For instance, dying is always a disappointing happening. Furthermore, killing is worse. Therefore, if these scenes are in TV, they would probably have their negative effects on the viewer who could be a child.Finally, beside all above mentioned items, the study of youngsters shall always been controlled. For example, a child watches a frightening movie. On the other hand, he has to study for the exam. In this condition, because he is thinking about the movie or whatever has happened in it, it is obvious that he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on his study perfectly. Hence, the study of a youngster would affected terribly.In conclusion, I certainly can say that growing of violence in films have definitely negative effects on youngsters mostly on their study, emotions and behaviors. Therefore, I think this matter should be controlled by parents or somehow by directors.;The question of whether growing violence in films has negatively impacted youngsters is a deeply pertinent one, warranting careful consideration. I firmly agree with the assertion that the increasing portrayal of violence in cinema has detrimental effects on younger audiences, culminating in desensitization, aggressive behavior, and warped perceptions of reality.Firstly, exposure to violent imagery can lead to desensitization among young viewers. When children and adolescents are repeatedly exposed to disturbing scenes, they may become numb to the gravity of violence, viewing it as a trivial or acceptable means of resolving conflicts. Research has shown that this desensitization can result in a diminished emotional response to real-life violence, making individuals less likely to empathize with victims and reducing their capacity for compassion.Moreover, films often glamorize violence, portraying it in a seductive and thrilling manner. This can instill a misconception in young audiences that aggression and hostility are viable tools to negotiate personal conflicts or assert dominance. For instance, studies have indicated a correlation between violent film consumption and increased aggressive behavior in children. Instead of learning constructive methods of conflict resolution, youngsters may emulate the violent behaviors that they see on screen, leading to heightened incidences of bullying and other forms of aggression.Additionally, the graphic portrayal of violence can distort youngsters’ understanding of societal norms. Films often depict violence without the consequences that would typically ensue in reality, fostering an unrealistic belief that such actions can be executed without repercussions. This distorted view can shape their outlook on justice and morality, potentially leading to antisocial behavior as they navigate their own interactions.In conclusion, the growing violence in films undeniably affects youngsters negatively. The risks of desensitization, the normalization of aggressive behavior, and the warped perception of reality necessitate a critical examination of the content presented to young audiences. As stewards of media consumption, it is imperative to promote responsible viewing that prioritizes the emotional and psychological well-being of our youth.
156;Agree or disagree: In order to be well-informed, a person must get information from many different news sources.;"Nowadays information plays an important role in our world. It has become a product, which can be sold, bought, or stolen. Some people say: ""information is power"". That's why it is so important to be well-informed. I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons.The first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability. Some people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information. For example, Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia. After a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia.Secondly, it is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations, because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate. Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts, especially in the internet, that's why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts. It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong. For example, several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops. The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the ""salt-panic"" was over. To conclude, I want to say that it is very important to be confident of the information, which you use, especially when your conclusion or decision may have a great influence.";In today's information-rich world, the necessity of consuming news from multiple sources is more crucial than ever to be well-informed. I agree with this assertion, as relying on a single source can lead to a skewed perception of events and issues.To begin with, different news outlets have their own editorial policies, biases, and approaches to reporting. These variances can result in contrasting portrayals of the same news event. For example, a story covered by a conservative publication may present facts in a way that aligns with its ideological stance, while a liberal outlet might frame the same story differently. By exploring a variety of news sources—spanning the political spectrum and encompassing various formats like print, online, and broadcast—readers can gain a more nuanced understanding of the issues at hand. This broadened perspective is vital in forming well-rounded opinions and making informed decisions.Moreover, the phenomenon of selective exposure, where individuals seek out information that confirms their existing beliefs, can perpetuate misinformation and polarization. When one limits themselves to a single news source, they are likely to miss out on critical viewpoints and essential information. Engaging with diverse perspectives not only counters confirmation bias but also stimulates critical thinking, allowing individuals to analyze the credibility of the information presented.Furthermore, in an age of misinformation where fake news can spread rapidly through social media, consulting multiple news sources acts as a safeguard against deception. A well-informed individual must be able to discern credible reporting from misleading narratives, and the best way to achieve this is through comprehensive research across various outlets.In conclusion, obtaining information from numerous news sources is essential for anyone aspiring to be well-informed. It fosters a deeper understanding of complex issues, combats bias, and enhances critical analytical skills, ultimately contributing to an enlightened society.
157;Some people argue that there is no point in persevering old buildings when land is so valuable in our cities. Others believe that old buildings are important part of our heritage and should be preserved. Discuss both these views and state your opinion.;The preservation of old buildings always is a large question for governments because conflict between the issues of housing for citizens and the protection of our culture. In my opinion, all of the old building which contribute to our sense of culture should be conserved.There are different reasons which persuade that people should not restore old buildings. As a result of the rapid urbanization process, in which rural people must go to urban centers to look for job opportunities, the question of the preservation of old buildings has become more pressing. Because of that need, governments can construct more accommodation instead of preserving old buildings. Besides that, the preservation is very expensive because all components of old buildings have historical values. Old buildings are an essential part of history. Tourist often decide to discover the culture of a country when they visit through those old buildings. Therefore, managers of cities can earn more money from the attraction provided by old buildings and that amount can be spent on their conservation. Furthermore, the preservation of old buildings is also a ways to conserve our culture and everyone can learn much from them. Old buildings should be used as the culture museums and provide accommodation with more convenient for people who live there. . Many cities have development strategies as a city contains both unique and modern beauty, and that preservation help to finish half of work.	Overall, both of those view have strong arguments: the need for housing or the expense of restoration contrast with our desire to conserve culture and attract tourism. So I think we should restore those building because old buildings process the most outstanding feature of areas which contain them.;The debate surrounding the preservation of old buildings versus the need for new development in urban areas is a complex one, reflecting broader societal values regarding history, culture, and economic growth. On one hand, proponents of redevelopment argue that land in cities is a finite and valuable resource. With the ever-increasing demand for housing and commercial spaces, especially in densely populated areas, the removal of old structures may seem like a practical solution. They contend that repurposing or demolishing older buildings to make way for modern developments not only optimizes land use but also stimulates economic activity by providing more space for businesses and residences that meet the current market needs.On the other hand, advocates for the preservation of old buildings emphasize the importance of cultural heritage and historical context. Old buildings often tell the stories of a city’s past, embodying architectural styles and craftsmanship that reflect the history, values, and identity of a community. Preserving such structures can foster a sense of belonging and continuity, enriching the urban landscape and tourism industry. Historical buildings can also serve as landmarks, providing a tangible link to the past for future generations. Furthermore, many old buildings possess unique design features and materials that cannot be replicated in modern construction, thereby adding aesthetic and cultural value to urban areas.In my opinion, while the pressures of urbanization and the need for space cannot be ignored, it is essential to find a balance. Rather than viewing old buildings solely as obstacles to development, cities should embrace adaptive reuse, where these structures are repurposed for contemporary uses while retaining their historical significance. This approach not only preserves heritage but also contributes to sustainable development practices, creating urban environments that respect the past while accommodating the future.
158;Nowadays, many young people say that mobile phones are the most important thing in their life. Do you think the popularity of mobile phones to young people is a good or bad development? Give relevant examples from your own experience.;Nowadays, many young people consider mobile phone as the most important thing in their lives as it keeps them constantly organized and it provides much convenience for them to reach out their families and friends. Despite all these positive aspects, I think that the popularity of mobile phones to the young generation is a bad development.First of all, many young owners of cellular phones are struggling at school because they are distracted most of the time with their phones. Games and applications installed in phones have occupied much of their time, leaving them lesser time for their studies and other school activities. Similarly, internet capable phones help influence the young ones to become more interested in chatting and social sites rather than doing school works. In my college days, I was once addicted to a certain game on my cellular phone. I have spent most of my time trying to reach a higher level to show-off to my friends. That goal has led me to my lost in interest on doing my homework and I ended up failing one subject in that semester.Secondly, juveniles who possess mobile phones have great tendencies to become materialistic. They would not only purchase a phone because of its functionality but also for its brand. Relatively, these do not come at a significant and inexpensive cost. Furthermore, most of these juveniles are students so they would need their parents to support them financially for what they want. An illustration of this unfortunate trend can be seen almost everywhere these days, wherein most teens at an early age own phones which are worth twice the salary of their parents. This clearly shows that the negative impacts brought about by mobile phones are harmful to a person’s education and character. Therefore, I highly discourage the young ones to be overly dependent on mobile phones.;"In today's digital age, mobile phones have become an integral part of daily life, especially among young people. While some argue that this dependence is detrimental, I believe that the popularity of mobile phones among the youth serves both positive and negative purposes, ultimately reflecting the complexity of modern communication and lifestyles.On one hand, mobile phones offer unprecedented access to information and facilitate seamless communication. For instance, young people can stay informed about global events through news apps and social media platforms, allowing them to engage in discussions and be part of a more interconnected world. Moreover, educational resources are readily available at their fingertips, enabling students to study more effectively outside the classroom. Personal experiences mirror this advantage; I often utilize my phone to access online lectures and collaborate with classmates through messaging apps, which enhances my learning experience.On the other hand, the pervasive use of mobile phones can lead to a range of adverse effects. The tendency to prioritize screen time over face-to-face interactions can hamper the development of crucial social skills, leading to feelings of isolation. For example, I have noticed that friends who excessively use their phones during gatherings contribute less to conversations, which can create an awkward atmosphere. Additionally, the constant notifications from social media can also lead to anxiety and distraction, adversely impacting mental health and academic performance.In conclusion, while the popularity of mobile phones among young people has brought about significant advantages such as improved access to information and enhanced communication, it also poses challenges that cannot be overlooked. Emphasizing a balanced approach towards mobile phone usage may help mitigate its negative effects while maximizing its benefits, encouraging young individuals to thrive in both their personal and academic lives."
159;Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Others, however,argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it, should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment.;"Generally reason behind punishment is to reduce the crime from a nation and to build a fear in the mind of offenders. Some people think that it does not matter what is reason behind committing a crime therefore there should be fixed punishment for a specific crime. Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions, that forces to a person to be a criminal.First of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime. Secondly, laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance ""a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women, who steals for her drug addiction"". The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place.On the contrary, fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government. Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal. Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other.To conclude, Government should decide for punishment case by case basis. In doing so crime can be eliminated from a nation and it is a responsibility of every individual to be in the favor of truth and respect the laws of our constitution.";"The debate surrounding whether fixed punishments should be imposed for each type of crime or whether individual circumstances should guide sentencing is a complex and multifaceted issue. On one side, proponents of fixed punishments argue that having a standardized system ensures fairness and equality in the justice system. They believe that consistent penalties deter crime effectively by sending a clear message about the consequences of certain behaviors. With established penalties, individuals are less likely to feel that they can evade justice, and the system appears more streamlined and less susceptible to bias.However, the counterargument recognizes the need for a more nuanced approach that considers the specific circumstances surrounding a crime. Each offense can vary dramatically in context and motivation; for instance, a theft committed out of dire financial need may reflect significantly different moral nuances than one perpetrated for greed. By evaluating the individual context, judges can make more informed decisions that better serve justice and rehabilitation, rather than merely retribution. This perspective encourages a more humane justice system where individuals have the opportunity to learn from their mistakes, rather than being boxed into one-size-fits-all penalties that may not address the root causes of their actions.Furthermore, rigid sentencing can lead to disproportionate punishments that do not consider a person’s background, mental health, or coercive circumstances. A young person with a troubled upbringing, for instance, may react differently than an adult acting with premeditation. Thus, allowing flexibility in sentencing permits more personalized and constructive outcomes.In conclusion, while fixed punishments offer clarity and uniformity, integrating individual circumstances into sentencing processes can lead to a more equitable and effective justice system. Balancing the necessity for consistent legal standards with the acknowledgment of personal circumstances can ultimately foster a system that upholds both justice and humanity."
160;Some people prefer to spend their free time outdoors. Other people prefer to spend their leisure time indoors. Would you prefer to be outside or would you prefer to be inside for your leisure activities? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your choice.;People often relax themselves by joining leisure activities. Some people prefer to spend their free time indoors. But from my experience, I myself prefer to spend my leisure time outdoors because I strongly feel that it is good for health and keep my body fit. Also, outdoor activities enable me to socialize with other people and enjoy natural beauty.There are strong advantages to spend leisure time outdoors. One benefit is that doing outdoor activities such as soccer and baseball is good for one's health. For instance, last year, I spent my summer time playing soccer and baseball. Playing baseball provided my upper body for hitting and throwing. Soccer, on the other hand, developed my lower body for kicking and endurance for playing full 90-minute-games. I belive that practicing these sports helped me greatly. Something else that is good is that playing these sports is to keep my body fit, make me ultimately refreshed. After that summer, my body is stronger and endurance is better. Outdoor activities not only improves my health but also gives me chances to communicate with more people. When I was ten years old, I was a shy girl. My mother took me to The National Camp. At first, I just ate and played alone. But on the third day, while I was swimming, a friendly girl came and greeted me, we became friend later and she taught me how to swim effectively. On the next day, we played together and she introduced me to her friends. Thanks to her and outdoor activities such as going skiing, climbing the mountain, I had a lot of friends since The National Camp. If, for example, I hadn't participate in that camping, I wouldn't have had many friends like today. Moreover, you can also enjoy the beautiful nature when doing some outdoor activities like going hiking, sunbathing, going biking. If you spend your spare time at home or something like that, you can't enjoy beautiful nature. Spending time outdoors, people can breathe fresh air, feel the warm sun on their face and enjoy the complete peace that only nature brings.Admittedly, indoor activities are fun. There's no doubt that indoor activities like reading a book, watching TV or listening to music can bring us lots of joy. Although I can also have fun in indoor activities, this advantage cannot outweigh the attractions coming from outdoor activities. After all, people are people and we have our own propensity. Leisure activities are one of them and I myself choose outdoor activities to spend my leisure time.;When it comes to leisure activities, I personally prefer to spend my free time outdoors. The appeal of the natural world, combined with the physical and mental benefits of outdoor activities, makes being outside a more fulfilling option for me.Firstly, being outdoors allows me to immerse myself in nature, which is refreshing and invigorating. Whether it’s hiking in the mountains, cycling through local parks, or simply taking a walk along the beach, I find that time spent in nature rejuvenates my spirit. The beauty of the landscape, the sounds of the wind rustling through the trees, and the fresh air contribute to an overall sense of well-being. For instance, during a recent hiking trip, I was mesmerized by the stunning views and the serenity of my surroundings, which lifted my mood and fostered a sense of connection with the environment.Furthermore, outdoor activities promote physical health and fitness. Engaging in sports like soccer, running, or swimming naturally encourages a more active lifestyle. Personally, I enjoy jogging in the early morning when the streets are quiet, which not only enhances my physical stamina but also clears my mind for the day ahead. The endorphin rush from exercise, combined with the invigorating outdoors, leads to improved mental clarity and reduced stress levels.Lastly, spending time outdoors often fosters social connections. Group activities such as team sports or outdoor barbecues provide opportunities to bond with family and friends. This sense of community and engagement is difficult to replicate indoors, where activities often tend to be more solitary, such as watching television or reading.In conclusion, my preference for outdoor leisure activities stems from my love for nature, the physical advantages it offers, and the social connections that often accompany these experiences. Being outside provides a well-rounded approach to relaxation and fulfillment, making it a vital aspect of my leisure time.
161;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxid into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;The debate surrounding cheap air travel often revolves around two starkly contrasting perspectives. Advocates for affordable air travel emphasize its role in democratizing mobility, allowing ordinary people the opportunity to explore distant destinations. Airlines that offer low-cost fares have revolutionized travel by making it more accessible to individuals who may have previously deemed flying a luxury. This newfound freedom supports cultural exchange, boosts local economies through tourism, and can enhance personal experiences through the exploration of diverse environments.Conversely, critics argue that while cheap air travel broadens horizons, it also exacerbates environmental issues. The aviation industry is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and the increase in flights due to lower prices can lead to a rise in pollution and the depletion of natural resources. As more people fly, the environmental repercussions intensify, posing a threat not only to our climate but also to biodiversity. Consequently, some believe that raising ticket prices could deter unnecessary travel and encourage more sustainable behaviors, such as using trains or choosing local destinations that require less carbon-intensive modes of transport.In my opinion, a balanced approach is essential. Encouraging alternative forms of travel, such as high-speed rail, alongside affordable air travel could mitigate some environmental impacts. Implementing carbon offset programs and promoting sustainable aviation technologies may also help reduce the carbon footprint of air travel without completely stifling accessibility. Education on the environmental effects of air travel can cultivate a more conscientious travel culture, where people consider their choices more carefully.In conclusion, while cheap air travel fosters personal freedom and economic opportunity, it is imperative that we address its adverse environmental effects. Striking a balance that allows for exploration without compromising our planet's health is crucial for future generations.
162;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;There are undeniable advantages to both life in a big city and in a small town. The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner, quieter and often friendlier place to live. However, despite the advantages of small town life, I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons.On the one hand, I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area. To make it convenient, I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace. What's more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city.On the other hand, life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town. You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities. For instance, you can visit museums to learn history, and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading, or you can go to a sports center for exercising. But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs.Furthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information. If one can efficiently acquire the information, then, there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals. For example, there are various advertisements here an there, whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones. If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel, or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store, he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice. There is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring. Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government, which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers. Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development. In conclusion, if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities, and have my children receive a better education, a big city is the place to live in.;The choice between living in a small town and a big city often hinges on personal values and lifestyle preferences. While both options have their merits, I prefer the charm and tranquility of a small town. One of the primary advantages of living in a small town is the sense of community and security it offers. In smaller communities, relationships tend to be more personal and meaningful. Neighbors are more likely to know each other, engage in conversations, and help one another in times of need. For instance, in my hometown, local events such as farmers’ markets and festivals foster a strong sense of belonging, where people come together to celebrate their culture and heritage. This community spirit often leads to deeper connections and a feeling of safety and support that is more challenging to find in the bustling atmosphere of a big city.Moreover, small towns typically provide a slower pace of life, allowing for a more relaxed and fulfilling lifestyle. Streets are less congested, and the daily hustle is replaced with an abundance of nature and open spaces. Growing up, I loved spending time outdoors in the nearby parks, where I could hike, bike, or simply enjoy the serenity that nature offered. This access to natural beauty is often diminished in urban settings, overshadowed by concrete and the constant traffic.Lastly, the cost of living in small towns tends to be significantly lower than in big cities. Housing is often more affordable, which allows for a better quality of life for individuals and families alike. With less financial strain, residents can enjoy a more balanced lifestyle, dedicating time to hobbies and personal pursuits rather than stressing over inflated housing costs and expenses.In conclusion, while big cities offer certain conveniences and opportunities, I find the tranquility, community spirit, and affordability of small towns far more appealing. The idyllic life they offer serves as a refuge from the demands and chaos of urban environments, making it a perfect choice for me.
163;Salary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways to reward employees for good work. What other rewards for good work can be effective in encouraging further good work? Use specific examples to support your response.;It is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work. Besides the methods, from my point of view, providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work. My arguments for this point are listed follows.Firstly, training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind. Clearly, in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer, complaining from boss, etc. Therefore, we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends, joking in class, enjoying new knowledge.Secondly, employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained. In this case, the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company. So obviously, they will think about develop long term career with their company. For another thing, employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don't have this opportunity. Thirdly, providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge. Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business, so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result. Of course, excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss.In conclusion, providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages. Training can help employees refresh their mind as well as make them happy, focus on work. Taking into account of all these factors, we may reach the conclusion that training can be effective in encouraging further good work.;While salary increases and promotions are commonly recognized as significant incentives for employees, numerous alternative rewards can effectively encourage continued good performance. These rewards can enhance job satisfaction, foster loyalty, and ultimately contribute to a more productive working environment.One of the most potent non-monetary rewards is recognition. Public acknowledgment of an employee's achievements can significantly boost morale and motivation. For instance, companies might implement a 'Employee of the Month' program or conduct regular meetings to highlight individual contributions. This not only validates the hard work of those recognized but also inspires others to strive for similar acknowledgment.Flexibility in work arrangements can also serve as a powerful incentive. Offering employees the option to work remotely or adjust their hours can lead to improved work-life balance. For example, tech companies like Google often provide flexible working conditions, showing trust in their employees' ability to manage time effectively. This autonomy can lead to increased productivity and fosters a culture of responsibility.Professional development opportunities are another effective reward. Organizations that invest in their employees' growth demonstrate a commitment to their career advancement. Providing access to training programs, workshops, or courses can empower employees, making them feel valued and encouraging loyalty. For instance, companies like Deloitte have robust mentorship programs that not only enhance employee skills but also build a supportive community within the workplace.Additionally, team-building activities and wellness initiatives can enhance workplace camaraderie and create a more engaged workforce. Organizing retreats, workshops, or wellness days promotes team cohesion and shows investment in employee well-being. Companies like Zappos are renowned for their emphasis on community and culture, leading to high levels of employee satisfaction.In conclusion, beyond traditional financial rewards, recognition, flexibility, professional development, and wellness initiatives are potent tools for encouraging and rewarding good work. By fostering an environment that values contribution and well-being, organizations can cultivate motivated employees who are committed to excellence.
164;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Attending university's classes is one of activities that students have to do. However, class is not the only source of knowledge. Students also learn from other sources such as experience, libraries and other people. I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons.Firstly, the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room. Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand. For example, I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university. She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast. Thus, she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic. Finally, she got very good grade when she was graduation.Secondly, students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well. In my experience, many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes. Also, I had already studied all biology topics before attending university. As a result, I spent the time of biology class to do my Chemistry research and got A+ for both biology and chemistry. In conclusion, I think the students should know what activities they should do at the time and have good management for their learning time. Also, they have to know how to deal with the effects from not attending classes. So that, attending classes in the university will not be required to the students anymore.;"The debate over whether university students should be required to attend classes or if attendance should be optional is a prominent issue in the educational landscape. I firmly believe that attending classes should be mandatory for several compelling reasons.First and foremost, in-person attendance facilitates direct engagement and interaction between students and professors. This dynamic creates an enriching learning environment where students can ask questions in real-time and participate in discussions that deepen their understanding of the subject matter. Engaging in dialogue not only enhances educational retention but also helps students develop critical thinking and communication skills that are essential in the workforce. Those who skip classes may miss out on these valuable opportunities for discussion and clarification, which can hinder their overall academic performance.Furthermore, mandatory attendance fosters a sense of accountability among students. University is often seen as a bridge to independence; however, the transition can be challenging. Requiring students to attend classes cultivates discipline and responsibility for their own learning. This structure can help students develop time management skills and establish a routine that is fundamental for success in their academic and professional futures. Conversely, allowing attendance to be optional might encourage procrastination and a lack of commitment to their education.Moreover, the social aspect of attending classes should not be overlooked. Universities are not just centers for academic learning but also places for personal development and networking. Meeting peers and forming connections in a classroom setting can lead to collaborative projects, study groups, and lifelong friendships. These interactions are integral to the university experience and can significantly enhance a student's personal and professional growth.In conclusion, while some may argue for the flexibility of optional attendance, the benefits of requiring university students to attend classes—such as enhanced learning, accountability, and social interaction—are substantial. A structured approach promotes an engaging and supportive educational environment, ultimately preparing students for their future endeavors."
165;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in?;In a few years I will finish my studying in the university and I will have to decide whether to live in a small town or a big city. As I am eager to get a good job and explore different places, I think I would prefer to live in a city.Big city life provides many opportunities. First of all, it will be easier for me to find an engineering job in the city. Electrical engineering deals with problems concerning electricity supply. Therefore, a big city can offer me many more vacancies than a small town.At the weekends, there is a great number of things to do in the metropolis. There are numerous bars, cafes and restaurants where I can go with my friends. Multinational cities have restaurants with different national cuisines. I am fond of Italian food, and if there is an Italian restaurant in the city, I will definitely visit it.A night club is an interesting place to visit for young people. There a person can listen to music, make new friends or enjoy a a drink alone. Cultural life of a metropolis is always an entertaining one. I am keen on museums and it would be a pleasure for me to spend several hours a week in front of famous paintings, sculptures or artifacts. On special dates, city offers free exhibitions which are available for everyone who is interested in art.What's more, cities have better medical facilities than in the countryside. This can at least assure me that if I feel bad, city can provide a high quality help. In conclusion, while small towns have picturesque nature and pure air, big cities offer countless amount of opportunities and entertainment places. Considering all the benefits, I would choose to live in a big city.;The debate between living in a small town versus a big city is one that encompasses various aspects of lifestyle, personal preference, and societal values. While both have their advantages, I would personally prefer to live in a small town.One of the most appealing aspects of small-town living is the sense of community that often flourishes there. In smaller settings, people tend to know their neighbors and develop deeper relationships. This creates a supportive environment where individuals look out for one another. Festivals, local markets, and community events allow people to connect and form bonds that can be harder to establish in the anonymity of a big city. This close-knit atmosphere fosters a sense of belonging that is often missing in urban environments.Furthermore, small towns usually offer a quieter and more peaceful lifestyle. The hustle and bustle of big cities can be overwhelming, with constant noise and traffic contributing to stress. In contrast, small towns often feature beautiful natural surroundings, which provide opportunities for outdoor activities like hiking, biking, and simply enjoying nature. This connection to the outdoors can significantly enhance one's quality of life, promoting mental and physical well-being.Additionally, the cost of living is typically lower in small towns. Housing prices, for example, are generally more affordable than in metropolitan areas. This financial relief allows for a better work-life balance, as individuals can spend less time working to afford a comfortable lifestyle, and more time enjoying life’s simple pleasures.In conclusion, while big cities offer excitement and diverse opportunities, the benefits of living in a small town—community connection, tranquility, and affordability—present a more appealing and fulfilling way of life for me. The choices we make about where to live significantly impact our overall happiness, and I believe that a small town would provide an enriching and satisfying experience.
166;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;The advent of the computer is one of the results of the development of the advantaged technology. While some people advocate for the idea that computers have made life more complex and stressful, others support the idea that computers have made life easier and more convenient. In my point of view, computers brought convenience and easiness to our life since they enabled easier access to information and increased qualities of the communication. First, computers through internet made our access to information easier. Through computers we can collect appropriate data very quickly, store it in the hard disc as long as we want and use it when needed. Search engines such as google, yandex with many features relevant to the characteristics of the information needed enable search of information in few minutes. Social networks such as facebook, twitter have changed traditional sources of information and decreasing the monopolization of the information by the governments. Hence, with the use of computers we spend less time in search for information, and can get it from different sources. Second, in a globalized world that we live computers made communications faster, visual and cheaper. With the use of email our messages can be delivered to any person in any part of the world in few minutes. In addition, it is convenient because you do not need to mile to the post office, but just click the mouse of your computer from the convenience of your arm chair in order to reach your friends, family members in any part of the world. Internet facilities such as msn, skype made visual communication possible. For example, via skype people not just communicate with their family members and friends, but also make interviews for employment, enrolment into universities. In result, communication has become cheaper, faster and visual. Finally, I believe that computers have made life easier and more convenient in the ways that it broadened the sources of information and made access more quick, a long with the improving quality of the communication in many ways.;"The advent of computers has undoubtedly transformed every aspect of human life, evoking a spectrum of opinions regarding their impact on our day-to-day existence. While some argue that computers have significantly simplified life, I hold the view that they have also introduced layers of complexity and stress that were previously nonexistent.On one hand, computers have undeniably enhanced convenience in countless ways. Tasks that once took hours can now be completed in moments. For instance, online banking has revolutionized the way we manage our finances; no longer do people need to visit a bank to deposit checks or transfer funds. Additionally, the internet has made access to information instantaneous. Students can conduct research quickly, allowing for a more efficient learning process. Communication, too, has been revolutionized. With a few clicks, we can connect with individuals across the globe, fostering relationships and collaboration that were once limited by geography.However, the convenience of computers can often disguise a growing complexity in our daily lives. Navigating the plethora of applications and software can be daunting, and the constant updates and changes in technology lead to stress as users struggle to keep up. Furthermore, the rise of social media and online interactions creates a paradox; while we are “connected,” the pressure to maintain an online presence can lead to anxiety and a feeling of inadequacy. The incessant notifications and demands for our attention can also detract from meaningful, offline experiences.In conclusion, while computers have undeniably made many aspects of life easier and more convenient, they have also introduced complexities and stresses that can be overwhelming. Balancing the benefits with the challenges is essential in understanding our relationship with technology. Ultimately, it is crucial for individuals to navigate this evolving digital landscape mindfully, ensuring that technology serves as a tool for enhancing life rather than complicating it."
167;Computers and modems have made it possible for office workers to do their work from home instead of working in offices every day. Working from home should be encouraged for workers and employees as it is good. Do you agree or dis? ;Some people think that working at home brings to workers and employees too much convenience, but i don't. Because the best conditions are sometimes not likely to be good as the expectation of people. Working without pressure and interaction are some examples for these disadvantages.Pressure is motivation. Each office has its rules that keep workers do their job as effectively as possible. The directors manage employers and give them the deadline of projects. Then again, the workers must try their best to finish the time limit. Doing all jobs at home don't make employees attempt to work like this. Computers and modems bring works to home but these still have many things distract their mind. Facebook or Yahoo have been the entertaining websites, however, they are the reasons why people cannot concentrate on their job. The dos and don't at office play important role to prevent these things from workers. In condition, doing all jobs alone makes employees fall asleep easily. As a result, the project cannot being done. The best condition might not be good for people. Interaction has been an advantage for workers at offices. Discussing and debating Projects together increase working ability because all we know that the target can be reached fast thanks to working of many people. Besides, interaction help employees improve their communicational skills, therefore, they will have more and more friends and relationships. Interaction is a factor increasing working quality.There will have many disadvantages if the workers work at home. Mitigating process, no interaction and pressure are these things people should examine when they want to work at home.;The advent of technology, particularly computers and modems, has dramatically transformed the traditional work environment, enabling office workers to perform their duties from home. The debate surrounding the encouragement of remote work is multifaceted, with compelling arguments endorsing the practice.One of the most pronounced advantages of working from home is the enhancement of work-life balance. Employees can structure their days to accommodate personal responsibilities, such as childcare or health activities, leading to increased job satisfaction. This flexibility often translates to higher productivity levels, as workers can operate in environments that suit their preferences. Moreover, the elimination of daily commutes not only saves time but also reduces stress, allowing employees to channel their energies more effectively into their tasks.Additionally, companies can significantly cut operational costs associated with maintaining physical office spaces. These savings can then be redirected toward employee benefits, technology upgrades, or training programs. A reduced overhead can enhance a company's competitive edge in the market, fostering a culture of innovation and responsiveness.However, there are compelling arguments against widespread remote work. Critics argue that the lack of in-person interaction can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection among team members, which might hinder collaboration and the development of a cohesive workplace culture. Moreover, not all employees may have optimal home environments conducive to productivity, potentially leading to distractions that could impact performance.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns regarding remote work, I believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. Encouraging workers to embrace this flexible approach can lead to increased satisfaction, productivity, and cost efficiency. By addressing the challenges through effective communication and the provision of necessary resources, businesses can create an enriching work environment that aligns with the evolving landscape of the modern workforce.
168;Some people think that a university professor should focus time on doing research, while others think that the main role of a professor is to educate students in a university. What is your opinion and why? Use specific reasons to support your answer.Ê;Nowadays, many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities. Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field, the research takes up too much teaching time. As far as I am concerned, professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research.To begin with, it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge. The professors’ duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses. If professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes. The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies. In this way, professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students. Therefore, professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research.On the other hand, if professors are busy in doing research, ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students, it would ruin the reputation of universities. Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course, and the enrollment of universities may decline. Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study. In this way, hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects. It is adverse to the whole academic field. Accordingly, spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors, rather than research.Nevertheless, professors could teach students through research and projects. Some students enjoy taking part in some research. Through to use the equipment and invent their own work, they may get more experience in the process of research. For instance, electronic students always invent new machines such as robots, MP3 and remote control car. They can manage the electric theory in practical skills. And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions. However, only under specific circumstance, when students master all of the systematic knowledge, can they accomplish research. This is requires professors provide high quality courses. In other word, professor should concern about preparing class.Consequently, conducting research is helpful for professors and students to some extent. However, the precondition of doing research is growing students’ solid theory fundamental. Only by developing students, can we have a better academic field. Professors could combine doing research and preparing good courses in a dynamic way.;The role of a university professor has long been a topic of debate, particularly concerning the focus on research versus teaching. While both aspects are crucial to the academic landscape, I believe that a professor's primary responsibility should be educating students. This stance is rooted in the fundamental purpose of universities and the impact of effective education on society.Firstly, the primary mission of universities is to foster learning and facilitate the growth of knowledge among students. Professors are not merely dispensers of knowledge but are instrumental in shaping the minds of future leaders, professionals, and thinkers. Effective teaching cultivates critical thinking skills, creativity, and intellectual curiosity, all of which are essential in a rapidly changing world. By prioritizing their role as educators, professors can ensure that students engage deeply with their subjects and acquire the skills necessary for their future careers.Additionally, the learning process often benefits from a professor’s research efforts. When professors are engaged in cutting-edge research, they bring fresh insights and real-world experiences into the classroom. However, if professors devote excessive time to research at the expense of teaching, students may miss out on personalized guidance and mentorship. The classroom environment can become less interactive, inhibiting the development of critical dialogue between students and educators.Moreover, the impact of education extends beyond individual classrooms. Educated individuals contribute significantly to societal progress, promoting innovation, social change, and informed citizenship. The knowledge and skills imparted in university settings can thus have far-reaching consequences, making the role of professors as educators paramount.In conclusion, while research is undeniably important for the advancement of knowledge and the institution's prestige, the essence of a professor’s role lies in educating students. Balancing both responsibilities is crucial, but prioritizing education ensures that students are equipped to navigate and contribute to the world effectively.
169;Technological progress in the past century has its negative effect, despite its remarkable contribution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In the past few decades, there were many remarkable achievements in technology fields that have numbers of beneficial effects on the whole society or individuals, although bringing some disadvantages to us.On one hand, the development of technology can prompt economic growth and the improvement of living standards. Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools, which play an important role in economic activity. Because of the technology of internet and air transportation, businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions. This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue.Besides, advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard. With the improvement of medical technology, it is obvious that the life expectancy in many countries has been significantly longer than before, and many serious diseases are under control. Digital entertainment technology allows people to enjoy playing interactive video games and watching three-dimensional movies, and this means that we could get more happiness from technology.On the other hand, the development of technology is likely to bring some negative effects on the environment and society. People utilize architecture technology to construct buildings to expand urban areas, and fuel companies apply drilling technology to extract a great amount of fossil oil in natural regions. This would pose a large threat to the ecology and environment. Vehicle technology enables many people to drive private cars, and emission of exhaust gas could lead to air pollution in large cities.In conclusion, although technological progress causes corresponding problems, it still provides us with much more advantages.;Technological progress over the past century has undeniably transformed nearly every aspect of human life, yielding remarkable contributions to society, the economy, and the environment. However, this rapid advancement has also resulted in several negative effects that cannot be overlooked. I contend that while the benefits of technology are substantial, its adverse impacts demand serious consideration.On one hand, technology has vastly improved communication, healthcare, and education. Innovations such as the internet have revolutionized how individuals connect and access information, breaking down geographical barriers. Medical advancements, including telemedicine and artificial intelligence in diagnosis, have resulted in better health outcomes and increased life expectancy. Moreover, technology has facilitated access to education through online learning platforms, empowering people in underserved areas to gain knowledge and skills.Nonetheless, the negative consequences of technological progress are significant. One main concern is the erosion of privacy as digital surveillance becomes more pervasive. With the proliferation of social media and data collection, personal information is often exploited, leading to a loss of autonomy and increased vulnerability to cybercrime. Furthermore, the rise of automation threatens job security for millions, as machines replace human labor in various industries. This has raised pressing economic questions about unemployment and income inequality.Additionally, the environmental impact of technology cannot be ignored. The production and disposal of electronic devices contribute to pollution and resource depletion. The increasing reliance on fossil fuels for energy to power these technologies exacerbates the climate crisis.In conclusion, while technological progress has undeniably improved the quality of life and fostered global development, its negative effects present pressing challenges that warrant attention. Striking a balance between embracing innovation and addressing its repercussions is essential for ensuring a sustainable and equitable future.
170;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;"The adage ""prevention is better than cure"" has long been recognized as a guiding principle in public health and wellness. The notion that allocating a larger portion of a country's health budget to health education and preventative measures rather than treatment resonates with many healthcare professionals and policymakers. I largely agree with this statement, as prioritizing prevention can lead to significant long-term benefits for both individuals and the healthcare system as a whole.First and foremost, investing in preventative measures can dramatically reduce the incidence of chronic diseases. Conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease are largely preventable through education on healthy lifestyles, proper nutrition, and regular physical activity. By equipping individuals with the knowledge and tools to make healthier choices, we can decrease the burden of these diseases on healthcare systems and improve the overall quality of life for citizens.Additionally, preventive care can mitigate healthcare costs in the long run. Treatments for advanced diseases are often far more expensive than preventive measures. For example, the cost of managing complications arising from chronic illnesses, including hospitalizations and long-term therapies, can be overwhelming. On the other hand, implementing community health programs, screenings, and vaccination campaigns can yield substantial savings and ensure more effective use of healthcare resources.However, it’s essential to recognize that while prevention is critical, it should not completely overshadow the need for adequate treatment options. A balanced approach is necessary, where both prevention and treatment are funded appropriately. For instance, individuals who have already developed health issues require ongoing care to manage their conditions effectively.In conclusion, I strongly believe that diverting a significant portion of a country's health budget towards health education and preventive measures is integral to enhancing public health. This strategy not only promotes individual wellness but also fosters a sustainable healthcare system, ultimately leading to healthier populations and reduced financial strain on national resources."
171;Students at a university often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.;Many students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages. After considering the level of freedom, the studying conditions and the economic factor, if I had to choose, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories.First, an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory. While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules, in the apartment you set your own rules. You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want. An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student. This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory.Second, from an economic point of view, people often argue that an apartment is more expensive. This is only partially true, you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper. Transportation is another issue, you have to go to and return from the university everyday. You could choose to use public transportation, a cheaper option, or to have a car. The car is an expensive option, but also offers freedom of schedule and destination.Lastly, the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don't have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories. A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times. Since in an apartment you don't have a roommate, you won't have this problem, and as a result you would be able to concentrate better. For the same reason, you won't have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music, bring friends over, or study late at night. You set your own schedules. In the other hand, living in a dormitory, and being surrounded by students also has some advantages, like being able to get help with any academic issues from them. To conclude, both options have their advantages, but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory.;When it comes to living arrangements during university, students often find themselves weighing the pros and cons of living in university dormitories versus renting an apartment in the surrounding community. Each option offers distinct advantages that cater to different preferences and lifestyles.Living in university dormitories provides a seamless transition into university life. One of the primary advantages is the immediate access to campus facilities, such as libraries, classrooms, and recreational centers. This proximity makes attending classes and participating in campus activities much more convenient. Moreover, dormitories often foster a sense of community among residents, which can be beneficial for students looking to make new friends and participate in social events. Living in close quarters encourages interaction, which can ease the loneliness that some students experience during their first year.On the other hand, choosing to live in an apartment in the community offers a different set of benefits. An apartment often grants more independence and freedom, allowing students to create their own routines and living environments. Students living off-campus may also have access to a larger living space and the ability to cook their own meals, which can lead to healthier eating habits. Additionally, living in a residential neighborhood may provide a more diverse social experience by exposing students to the local culture and community life outside of the university bubble.Personally, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community. While I appreciate the convenience and social opportunities offered by university housing, I value the independence and personal space that comes with living off-campus. Having the ability to establish my own schedule, cook my meals, and engage with the larger community would contribute significantly to my personal growth during my university years. Furthermore, developing life skills, such as budgeting and managing household duties, would be invaluable experiences that are crucial for my transition into adulthood.
172;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;Have you ever seen a real life bear or a monkey? If you did, it was probably at a zoo. Zoos are big outdoor spaces in which different animal species are kept, so that people can look, learn and admire them. A lot of people think that zoos have no use, or provide no purpose. I strongly disagree with this affirmation because I believe zoos provide social interaction, education, and develop qualities such as animal respect and understanding.When people visit the zoo, they normally do it in a group, with their families, or as a part of a school group activity. In the zoo they interact with each other and are able to relax and look at the animals, play with some of them, comment on their appearance and behavior, and laugh at their funny customs. Nowadays families do not spend as much time together as they used to a couple of decades ago. The zoo is a great reason for spending time with the family, it is a great activity that can be enjoyed every family member, from little children to grandparents. Animals, the different species, their habitats and behaviors are a subject of study at schools and universities. We can learn a lot from books and lectures, but there is an even better way to learn, that is visuals and personal experience. If you visit the zoo, you get to watch the animals, their customs, what they eat and how they eat it, as well as which characteristics the different species have. In the zoo you can see an animal and their different variations, the male and the female or the baby and the adult. It offers a great opportunity to observe their reactions to different situations, such as weather, specie and genre interaction, defense behavior, or protection of their babies. Moreover, it will also help identify which animals could be dangerous. Visiting the zoo would help the students understand what they learn at school. Finally, a visit to the zoo will help increasing someone's respect and appreciation for animals. It is a lot easier to appreciate something after you have seen it, and learned from it. This is especially true for people living in the city, where the only animals they normally interact with are pets like cats and dogs. In the present there is a lack of respect for animals. Being able to see the animals in real life and learning facts about them would help by making people aware of the importance of animals and the respect they deserve.The reason why most people oppose to zoos is that in some of them the animals are not very well taken care of and they do not have good and clean facilities. This is mostly true but does not relate to the purpose of zoos. It would be great if every zoo kept the animals in perfect conditions, but regardless of the condition, zoos are very useful.;The purpose of a zoo has been a topic of contention for many years, with opinions divided on whether they serve any useful purpose in today's society. I contend that zoos do hold significant value, both for education and species conservation.First and foremost, modern zoos play a critical role in educating the public about wildlife and the environment. Through carefully designed exhibits, zoos provide visitors with the opportunity to observe animals in ways that might not be possible otherwise. For example, children can learn about biodiversity, ecosystems, and the importance of conservation efforts through interactive programs and guided tours. By fostering awareness and appreciation for wildlife, zoos inspire future generations to engage in environmental stewardship and support conservation initiatives.Moreover, zoos contribute to the preservation of endangered species. Many zoos participate in breeding programs that aim to increase the population of species at risk of extinction. The success of such programs can be demonstrated by the recovery of species like the California condor and the Arabian oryx, which have been reintroduced into the wild after significant efforts in captivity. Without zoos, these species would likely face a grim fate, driven to extinction by habitat loss and poaching.Critics often argue that confining animals in enclosed spaces is inhumane. However, many modern zoos prioritize animal welfare, providing environments that mimic their natural habitats and allowing them to exhibit natural behaviors. Progressive zoos are committed to research that informs their care for animals and generates data beneficial for wildlife conservation globally.In conclusion, zoos are far from purposeless. They serve as vital institutions for education and species conservation. By fostering an appreciation for nature and playing a significant role in protecting endangered wildlife, zoos contribute positively to society and the planet as a whole.
173;Some movies are serious, designed to make the audience think. Other movies are designed primarily to amuse and entertain. Which type of movie do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"I prefer the serious movies which are simple, touching and powerful. Here are my reasons. First, most serious movies have a wide variety of content. Entertaining movies are created to amuse people. However, most entertaining movies are empty and nonsensical. Compared with the entertainment film, the serious film may be more worthwhile and meaningful. Serious movies usually designed to express one or more thinking about love, humaneness; moreover, it may point out the dark sides of the society.Second, not all of serious movies are boring. ""Click"" is a very interesting comedy, with a serious approach about the importance of having a balanced life between family and work businesses. The movie is humorous and satiric,which leads us to think what is the most valuable of our lives, and it reminds us how important our families are. Thus, the hidden meanings of serious movies are usually beyond words and images which make us think about ourselves.Moreover, some of serious movies try to make you think about the dark sides of the world. ""Blood diamond"", an adaptation of a real story in South Africa, focuses on the link between diamonds and conflict. After watching the movie, we may learn a lesson between jewels and death. Diamonds are not rare or a sign of true love; indeed, the hidden meaning of a diamond is a cruel reality. As a result, serious movie tell you how to see the world in a different way.For the above reasons, I prefer to see those serious movies which make people have deep thoughts toward their real lives.";"In the realm of cinema, different types of movies serve distinct purposes, engaging audiences in various ways. Personally, I gravitate towards serious films crafted to provoke thought and reflection. While entertaining movies undoubtedly have their place, the depth and complexity found in serious films resonate with me on multiple levels.One of the primary reasons I prefer serious movies is their capacity to stimulate critical thinking. Films that tackle complex themes, such as societal issues, moral dilemmas, or existential questions, often leave a lasting impact on the viewer. For instance, movies like ""Schindler's List"" or ""12 Years a Slave"" not only recount historical atrocities but also provide insights into human nature, compassion, and the consequences of inaction. These films challenge audiences to engage with difficult subjects, fostering a sense of empathy toward others’ experiences.Additionally, serious films often boast intricate storytelling and character development. When a movie invests in developing its characters, audiences become more emotionally connected to their journeys. ""The Pursuit of Happyness"" showcases the struggles of a father attempting to create a better life for his son. The movie delves into themes of resilience, hope, and the pursuit of happiness, ultimately leading viewers to reflect on their own lives and aspirations.Furthermore, serious films often encourage discussions and debates among viewers, fostering a deeper understanding of complex issues. For example, films like ""The Social Network"" can spark conversations about ambition, ethics, and the nuances of human relationships in the digital age. Such discussions contribute to a richer understanding of contemporary society, allowing audiences to analyze their beliefs and perspectives.In conclusion, while comedic films have their charm and provide light-hearted enjoyment, my preference lies with serious movies that encourage introspection and engagement with significant themes. The transformative potential of these films makes for a rewarding cinematic experience that lingers well beyond the viewing."
174;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines, and other media pay too much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;As a mass media majoring student, I think that it's true that media is overemphasizing the personal lives of famous people in this modern society. In my point of view, disadvantages of overemphasizing on personal lives of famous people by media outweigh its advantages. My reasons include the following:It is no doubt that the media provide information about an event that recently occurred somewhere and which is important to the people. The most important of all is that the essence of coverage accurate and not based on gossip. However, journalism is changing. Some reporters are more interested with gossip than news relating to public issues, paying too much attention to the personal lives of famous people.First of all, gossip involves misleading images for the purpose of boosting newspaper sales or exciting public opinion. The audience may see a lot of photos in the kind of reports, which seems to tell a story. Moreover, it is unfair that the ridiculous coverage may be a vexation for the famous people who are reported.Furthermore, sensationalism distract the viewers from public or social problems. The media face the challenge that media executives must choose the content, which can attract the audience. Thus, these personal reports of famous people, unimportant information or distorted stories, will not solve problem related with the society. In other words, yellow journalism block the viewers from significant news, such as education, environment and public issues.Based on the above discussion, I agree with that paying too much attention on personal lives of famous people may be a serious problem.;In today’s digital age, the media plays an undeniably influential role in shaping public perceptions, especially regarding public figures and celebrities. I firmly agree that television, newspapers, magazines, and other media sources pay excessive attention to the personal lives of these individuals, often at the expense of more pressing issues that warrant public discourse.One significant concern is that the relentless focus on celebrity culture detracts from essential news coverage. While the mundane details of a celebrity’s life, such as relationship scandals or fashion choices, dominate headlines, critical global issues often receive less attention. For instance, topics like climate change, political corruption, and social justice are relegated to the background, overshadowed by headline-grabbing gossip. This disproportionate focus not only trivializes significant social issues but also fosters a culture of superficiality, where individuals may prioritize entertainment over education or awareness.Furthermore, the obsession with the personal lives of public figures can lead to harmful narratives. The media's relentless scrutiny often results in the invasion of privacy, and celebrities become targets of unwarranted criticism and judgment. Mental health struggles among public figures, which are exacerbated by invasive media coverage, highlight the toxic environment created by this fixation. Such attention can dehumanize these individuals, reinforcing stereotypes and perpetuating a culture of judgment rather than understanding.Finally, this overemphasis on celebrity personal lives can skew societal values, leading the public to idolize fame rather than achievement or integrity. Younger audiences, in particular, might equate success with notoriety rather than hard work or meaningful contributions to society.In conclusion, while media coverage of public figures can provide entertainment and distraction, I believe that the excessive focus on their personal lives is detrimental to both individuals and society at large. It is essential to foster a more balanced media landscape that prioritizes valuable information over sensationalism.
175;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;As a lover of travel, a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour, which can be explained by the following reasons.Primary, it is easy to know the history of the new place. Last year, I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum, where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York. Through the exhibit, I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom, and Ellis Island may be the place, where the immigration took their dreams and fears. Thus, museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place.Secondary, visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon. Those outstanding and diverse range of objects,with classic and magnificent art, is guaranteed to inspire us! In my city, National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts. To my astonishment, Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work, which is made of jade, is vividly shown.Moreover, a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit. Someone take a trip without making any plans, so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel. As a result, visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision. Most important of all, a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time.For the above reasons, if we have a chance to visit top museums in the world, we must stop by these museums. During our trip, it is worthwhile for us to visit a museum of a new place.;Visiting museums is a fundamental part of the travel experience for many individuals. This is because museums serve not only as repositories of art and history but also as vital cultural explorers that enrich our understanding of the world.One of the primary reasons people visit museums is to gain a deeper understanding of the history and culture of a region. Museums often showcase artifacts, artworks, and exhibitions that trace the development of civilizations, giving travelers a tangible connection to the past. For example, a visit to the British Museum in London allows visitors to see the Rosetta Stone and other ancient artifacts, providing insights into Egyptian civilization. Such experiences help travelers appreciate the uniqueness of the culture they are exploring and foster a sense of global interconnectedness.Another significant reason is the opportunity for education and inspiration. Museums often provide various interactive exhibits and guided tours that cater to different interests and age groups. Children can engage with science and natural history at places like the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, while art enthusiasts can immerse themselves in masterpieces at the Louvre. These experiences can spark curiosity, encourage learning, and even inspire creativity among visitors. Furthermore, museums often reflect contemporary societal issues and provoke critical thinking, urging visitors to engage with the world in meaningful ways. For instance, exhibitions on climate change or social justice initiatives can stimulate discussions on pressing global challenges, encouraging travelers to reflect on their role in advocacy and awareness.In conclusion, people visit museums while traveling for multifaceted reasons, including the desire to connect with local history and culture, to educate and inspire themselves, and to engage with important social themes. Museums enrich travel experiences and provide lasting memories that go beyond mere sightseeing.
176;In the future, students may have the choice of studying at home by using technology such as computer or television or studying or traditional school? Which would you prefer? Use specific details to explain your choice.;"I don't think that technology can replace teachers and classroom. Here are my reasons. Studying at home by using technology is convenient. The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day. In addition, you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course. You can study any time you want. However, if you aren't extremely dedicated or have good time management skills, it may be very difficult to complete a course at home.First, attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience. Especially when you don't have an instructor there to guide you, it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements. Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects. Unfortunately, it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help. Second, studying at home is very different from traditional learning. Unlike traditional classes, distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates. Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision. If you are the type that gets easily distracted, a distance-learning program may not be for you.Furthermore, there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization- establishes relationship with classmates. We can learn a lot from programs at home; however, our computers or televisions can't teach us how to get along with people. For example, students may learn how to cooperate with classmates from teamwork. Studying alone at home might deprive us of these significant and valuable opportunities. For the above reasons, I agree that distance education can't replace traditional school.";In the rapidly evolving landscape of education, the choice between studying at home using technology and attending traditional schools presents compelling options for students. While both approaches have their merits, I firmly believe that studying at home through technology offers unique advantages that better cater to the diverse learning needs of today’s students.Firstly, flexibility stands out as a major benefit of home-based learning. With the ability to set their own schedules, students can tailor their study times to when they are most alert and productive. This adaptability enables learners to balance their academic pursuits with other responsibilities or interests, fostering a more holistic approach to education. For example, a student passionate about sports could allocate more time to practice without compromising their studies, leading to increased motivation and satisfaction.Moreover, technology-enhanced learning provides access to an expansive range of resources. Digital platforms can offer interactive lessons, virtual simulations, and a wealth of online materials that cater to various learning styles. For instance, visual learners can engage with video content, while auditory learners benefit from recorded lectures. This myriad of resources ensures that students can find the most effective means to grasp complex concepts, ultimately improving their learning outcomes.Another key advantage of studying at home is the reduction of social stressors often present in traditional school settings. Many students face challenges like bullying or peer pressure that can detract from their educational experience. Learning at home can create a safe, supportive environment that allows students to focus on their studies without the distractions of social dynamics.In conclusion, while traditional schools offer structure and social interaction, I prefer the flexibility and richness of studying at home through technology. The ability to personalize learning, coupled with access to diverse resources and a stress-free environment, positions home-based education as an increasingly viable and attractive option for future students.
177;It has recently been announced that a large shopping center may be built in your neighborhood. Do you support or oppose this plan? Why? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;I believe that it is a good idea to build a large shopping center in our community. The following are my reasons.In the first place, the establishment of a large shopping center will provide the residents a more convenient place to go shopping. Here is a positive example: Queens Center Mall, a shopping mall located in Queens borough of New York City, provides a wide vairtey of stores, products and services, from clothing to electronics and restaurants, that consumers can choose. It is widely thought that it is one of the most productive malls in New York. I found that I could find virtually every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney, when I visited there. As far as I am concerned, a large shopping mall provides a location for residents to pursue during their leisure time.Furthermore, it not only provides a place to shop but also offer people jobs. There may be a great number of job vacancies in the need of opening the new stores in the shopping mall. It could be an opportunity for people who are looking for a part-time job or a full time job. Some students and retirees may work there in order to whiling away their free time and earning money.Lastly, it is more likely for us to buy goods in lower price in the shopping center, and save our time on the other hand. There may be a competition between the new shopping center and other existing stores to attract the customers. Accordingly, with sales promotion, it is easy for consumers to compare the price of the same merchandise before they buy. In addition, the residents do not have a problem spending time on commute in the hope of setting up a shopping center near their homes.For the above-mentioned reasons, I advocate building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to our community.;"The announcement of a large shopping center potentially being built in my neighborhood has elicited a mixed response among residents; however, I firmly believe that this development should be opposed. While some may argue that a shopping center could boost convenience and local employment opportunities, the negative impacts on community dynamics, traffic congestion, and the environment far outweigh these potential benefits.Firstly, adding a shopping center would likely disrupt the unique character of our neighborhood. Our area is characterized by its close-knit community feel and local businesses that reflect our identity. Introducing a large retail complex could lead to the decline of these small businesses that rely on customer loyalty and integration within the community. Instead of fostering our communal identity, a shopping center could homogenize our area, replacing local flavor with commercial uniformity.Moreover, the inevitable increase in traffic congestion is a significant concern. Our streets are already busier during peak hours, and adding a shopping center would amplify this issue, making them unsafe for pedestrians and cyclists. Increased traffic can lead to more accidents and create an unpleasant environment for families and residents who enjoy the tranquility of our neighborhood.Additionally, there are environmental considerations to factor in. The construction of a shopping center typically involves significant land use changes and may disrupt local wildlife habitats. Clearing land for retail space can also lead to increased pollution and reduced green spaces, which are essential for maintaining biodiversity and providing recreational areas for residents.In conclusion, while the allure of convenience and job creation may seem appealing, the potential drawbacks of constructing a shopping center in my neighborhood—including the erosion of community identity, heightened traffic congestion, and environmental degradation—far outweigh the benefits. It is crucial to prioritize the preservation of our neighborhood’s unique charm and well-being over commercial interests."
178;What is a very important skill a person should learn in order to be successful in the world today? Choose one skill and use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;"Some people think that life is a struggle, which means we may encounter numerous difficulties during our lives. Accordingly, stress management, how to survive our unbearable stress, is the most important skill that we should have. Here are my reasons. Stress, our body's way of responding to any kind of demand, can be caused by both good and bad experiences. Stress may be a positive mobilization to drive for success. However, it is widely thought that we experience stress any time, which comes across unexpectedly that frustrates our goals. As a result, if we don't have a good stress management skill, it may lead to some critical problems.In the frenetic, fast-paced world, it is a very common predicament that all of us, from the young to the senior, feel depressed caused by stress, such as financial problems, exam stress, relationship difficulties and work overload. Some people regard stress as a power, which overcomes the obstacles to motivate themselves to do their best; other people cannot charge of their thoughts, emotions, and the way they deal with problems. Therefore, stress management recently becomes a more significant issue in our realization.Furthermore, stress takes a toll on our health. It is known that the modern life is frequently full of hassles, frustrations, and demands. This is one of the reasons why people were overwhelmed by constant stress. Thus, some people have physical problems, such as insomnia and headaches. Melancholia, the most fatal problem, even leads some people to commit suicide. Consequently, it is necessary that we should reduce and cope with our stress in the goal of balancing our mind and body. To avoid being a pessimist, we may try to conquer our distress by sharing our worry with friends or families, doing exercise regularly, and trying to see our troubles in a different way.For the above reasons, I believe that stress management is an essential skill for everyone to learn and find their own way to solve their stress.";"In today’s rapidly evolving world, one essential skill that individuals must acquire to achieve success is effective communication. This skill goes beyond mere conversation; it encompasses the ability to convey ideas clearly, listen actively, and foster meaningful connections with others. As our society becomes increasingly interconnected through technology and globalization, strong communication skills have become crucial in both personal and professional contexts.Firstly, effective communication enhances collaboration. In workplaces where teamwork is essential, the ability to articulate thoughts and ideas clearly can drive projects forward. For instance, consider a project team tasked with developing a new product. Team members who can express their viewpoints and actively engage in discussions are more likely to contribute innovative solutions. Effective communication fosters a sense of trust and encourages open dialogue, allowing diverse perspectives to be shared, ultimately leading to better decision-making and outcomes.Secondly, strong communication skills are vital in navigating cultural differences. As organizations expand their reach across borders, professionals often interact with colleagues from various cultural backgrounds. Understanding and respecting different communication styles can prevent misunderstandings and promote harmony. For example, a manager who practices active listening and adapts their communication style to suit team members from diverse cultures is more likely to build a cohesive work environment, reducing conflict and enhancing productivity.Finally, effective communication is essential for personal branding in an era dominated by social media. Individuals who can present themselves attractively can create opportunities for networking, job prospects, and partnerships. A professional with strong writing skills, for instance, can articulate their expertise through LinkedIn articles, making them more visible to potential employers.In conclusion, mastering effective communication is an indispensable skill for success in today’s world. It fosters collaboration, bridges cultural divides, and enhances personal branding. As we navigate an increasingly complex and interconnected landscape, the ability to communicate effectively will undoubtedly set individuals apart and contribute to their achievements."
179;Groups or organizations are an important part of some people's lives. Why are groups or organizations important to people? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;"During our life, it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations; therefore, groups and organizations are an important part of their lives. In my point of view, groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals. My reasons include the following:In the first place, humans are a part of the society, and the society includes a wide variety of groups. Most of all, the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults. We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life. By making teamwork, the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others. As university students, it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others. After graduating from schools, employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits. Thus, almost of us live in the environment of groups.By participating in an organization, it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose. A solid group can be a suited environment, which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons. For example, as a student majoring in mass media, I have taken part in mass media student group for a year. When being in the department of art, I have not only learned how to do a project, but also known some famous artists during the term. Above all, it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job.Furthermore, groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal. Here is an example: there are various charities in the world. Tzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan, is famous for contributing to the social and community services, and medical care. They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit. For accomplishing their missions, the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks. As a result, they lit the light for the poor and victims; in addition, they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world. For the above reasons and examples, it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds.";Groups and organizations play a pivotal role in many people's lives, serving as anchors for social interaction, support, and personal development. Their importance can be understood through three primary dimensions: social connection, shared goals, and collective support.Firstly, groups provide vital social connections. Humans are inherently social beings, often seeking companionship and a sense of belonging. Whether it's a book club, a sports team, or a professional organization, these groups foster relationships and camaraderie among their members. For instance, a study group not only helps individuals grasp complex subjects but also creates friendships that can last a lifetime. When people interact in a group, they share experiences, cultural backgrounds, and perspectives, which enrich their understanding of the world and contribute to personal growth.Secondly, organizations often unite individuals with shared goals, providing a platform for collective action towards common interests. Members of a charity organization, for instance, collaborate to address societal issues such as poverty or education. By pooling their resources and talents, they can achieve far more than any individual could alone. This sense of purpose can motivate members, giving their efforts a deeper meaning. Additionally, the structure within these organizations often leads to enhanced productivity, as defined roles and responsibilities enable focused and efficient work towards shared objectives.Lastly, groups and organizations serve as essential support systems. In times of crisis or significant life transitions, people often turn to these networks for guidance and encouragement. Support groups, whether for addiction recovery or grief, provide a safe space for individuals to share their experiences and feelings, validating their struggles and fostering resilience. The emotional and psychological benefits derived from these interactions can be transformative, offering hope and strength during challenging times.In conclusion, groups and organizations are integral to many individuals' lives for social connection, collaborative purpose, and emotional support. Their influence extends beyond mere affiliation, shaping personal identities and enhancing overall well-being. Recognizing this importance can motivate individuals to actively seek out and engage with various groups and organizations, contributing to a richer, more fulfilling life.
180;The government has announced that it plans to build a new university. Some people think that your community would be a good place to locate the university. Compare the advantages and disadvantages of establishing a new university in your community. Use specific details in your discussion;I will be happy to hear that the government has a plan to build a new university in my community. There are many advantages setting up the university such as more opportunities to people in the community to pursue their studies, creation of jobs. However, they come together with some disadvantages such as social problems.This new university will allow a great number of people in my community to have a chance to study. For example, suppose you live in a faraway community where there is no single university and you might not want to leave your family. If you would like to attend a business school, you have to travel across the country to get to a distant university. He or she definitely can get in the business school in the proposed community's university.Undoubtedly, the university will have to hire professors, employees and etc. Thus, a number vacant positions need to be filled. Also there will be more opportunities to work in the community. Moreover, when people have jobs, they will have money to spend on goods and services. This can also help stimulate the local economy. However, building the university may lead to some social problems. A number of people then may come from any other communities in order to get in to or get the jobs at the university. When many people congregate in one place, I think that some kinds of social problems will follow. Traffic may worsen. More wastes have to be managed. Maybe crime rate will also increase. These social problems may impair the quality of life in the community. In sum, I myself agree with the plan to build the university. I believe the benefit from it will outweigh the cost. However, it would be indispensable that the government conduct a survey about the community opinion on the new university first.;The proposal to establish a new university in our community presents a mixture of promising advantages and potential disadvantages that warrant careful consideration. One of the primary benefits of locating a university in our region is the enhancement of local economic development. Universities serve as significant economic engines, creating jobs not only for academic staff but also for administrative personnel, maintenance workers, and local businesses that thrive on the influx of students and staff. Increased foot traffic can bolster retail, dining, and housing markets, transforming our community into a vibrant hub of activity. Additionally, a university can attract research grants and foster partnerships with industries, thereby promoting innovation and entrepreneurship.Another advantage is the prospect of educational enrichment for local residents. Establishing a university creates opportunities for higher education that may reduce the need for students to travel far from home for quality education. This localized access could enhance skill development in the community, making residents more competitive in the job market. Moreover, the presence of a university could foster cultural and intellectual growth, providing a venue for lectures, workshops, and events that benefit the entire community.However, there are disadvantages to consider as well. The construction and operation of a university could lead to increased traffic congestion and noise, which might disrupt the peaceful atmosphere currently enjoyed by residents. Local infrastructure, such as roads and public transport, may become overloaded, necessitating upgrades that could strain municipal budgets. Furthermore, the influx of students may drive up housing costs, potentially displacing long-time residents or making it harder for families to afford living in the community.In conclusion, while the establishment of a university in our community holds substantial benefits, such as economic growth and educational opportunities, it also raises significant challenges, including infrastructure strain and rising living costs. A balanced approach, considering these varying factors, will be crucial in determining the long-term impact of such a project.
181;While some pelple believe that the government should provide a college education free to any citizen who wants it, others beleve that it is up to the individual to finance his/her own education.Ê;"Some people believe that the government should cover the college tuitions and expenses for any citizen who wants to go to a college. However, I believe that individuals should pay their college tuition because it would cost too much, the college education is a personal's choice, and there are many ways to fund a college education. First, making college education free would cost too much. It would divert public funds from other needs such as law enforcement, infrastructure and so forth. There are many other needs which should come first, such as providing health care to all American, or improving public schools. In addition, it would cause to raise our taxes again and again to fund college education. Consequently, it would affect all taxpayers whether or not they benefit from the use of the funds. Second, it is a personal choice to go to a college. Not everyone wants to go to a college. People who want to make more money, and live a better life than other people decide to take a college education. Therefore, those people should make the financial investment in their own choice; not the government.Third, there are many ways to fund a college education. People who cannot afford to pay their tuition benefit from the scholarship, financial aids, and other funds. In addition, the government already helps pay college expense through indirect means. They often provide services such as fire departments, medical assistance, and police protection for the schools and their students. They also provide funds for academic research. While the money is not given to individual students, these contributions are not trivial. In short, the individual should finance his or her education because it is a personal choice. Otherwise, it would cause too much cost from taxpayers and the government.";The debate surrounding the financing of college education is multifaceted, with compelling arguments from both sides. On one hand, advocates for free college education argue that access to higher education should be a universal right, much like primary and secondary education. They point out that by providing free access, the government can help eliminate socio-economic barriers that prevent talented individuals from pursuing their academic aspirations. A well-educated populace can contribute more effectively to the economy, innovate, and lead to enhanced social mobility. Furthermore, countries that have implemented free college education, such as Germany and Sweden, often report higher enrollment rates and lower student debt burdens, showcasing a successful model that could potentially be emulated elsewhere.Conversely, opponents of free college education contend that individuals should take personal responsibility for their educational expenses. They argue that when education is entirely funded by the government, it may lead to inefficiencies, as it could diminish the perceived value of a college degree. The competition for admission might decline, leading to a potential oversaturation of graduates in the job market, ultimately devaluing degrees. Furthermore, the financial burden of free education would likely fall on taxpayers, raising concerns over the sustainability of such programs.In conclusion, both viewpoints present valid arguments. While the idea of free college education aligns with principles of equity and societal benefit, it raises practical concerns regarding funding and value. Striking a balance between government support and individual responsibility could lead to a more sustainable and equitable educational framework. Options such as income-driven repayment plans, scholarships, and targeted government funding for underserved communities may serve as a middle ground, ensuring access while maintaining individual accountability.
182;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"We all know that television provides us many benefits; it helps people relax, helps keep up with news, helps broad our mind. However, have you ever thought that television has destroyed communication among friends and family? I personally consider this fact as the harmful thing that television has brought upon us.First of all, since people watch television too much, they can be isolated from others. Children, for example, pay more attention on movies, music show provided by television and do not want to do anything else such as going to school or practicing exercise with friends will be taken apart by others. Gradually, their friends leave them behind either activities or studying.Secondly, with the rapid change of the standard of life, each family has three or four TV in each room is more common. Parents and even children do not want to communicate with each other instead of watching TV in their own room. As a consequence, children will learn behavior from what they see on TV not from their parents. Moreover, parents are not able to function their parental care as the necessary thing to children. In this way, communication between family members is visibly destroyed.Last but not least, watching too much television people will unconsciously learn bad behavior that sow division among human. For example, watching film about terrorist children will be able to consider terrorism as a right thing. What happens if they do act exactly the terrorist in Hollywood movies does? is this one of the reason cause division in society?In conclusion, though television has some good sides, it has destroyed communication among friends and family. We need to quickly find the way to address this problem as soon as possible and the first concern is to reducing violent behaviors that children learn from television.";In the modern world, television is often criticized for its potential to undermine communication among friends and family. While I understand the concerns surrounding excessive television viewing, I disagree with the assertion that television has destroyed communication. Instead, I believe that television can serve as a catalyst for conversation and bonding among family members and friends if consumed thoughtfully.Firstly, television offers a wealth of shared experiences that can foster deeper connections among individuals. For instance, watching a popular show together can spark dialogue about characters, plot twists, and thematic messages. This shared experience often leads to lively discussions that would not have occurred otherwise. Familiarity with cultural references from popular series or movies can enhance relationships by providing common ground for conversation. Families that gather to watch a favorite program each week often find new topics to explore together, thereby deepening their connections.Moreover, television can serve as an educational tool that encourages family discussions about important issues. Documentaries and news programs bring critical topics into the living room, offering a platform for family members to share their opinions and learn from one another. This can lead to meaningful discussions about societal issues, personal beliefs, and values, thereby strengthening family bonds.However, it is essential to address the potential for television to become a barrier to communication if not moderated. When individuals become engrossed in their screens without engaging with one another, the quality of their interactions can diminish. Therefore, it is crucial for families and friends to set boundaries around viewing habits to ensure television remains a source of enrichment rather than distraction.In conclusion, while excessive television viewing can hinder communication, it can also provide valuable opportunities for connection and conversation when approached mindfully. Rather than considering television a destructive force, we should recognize its potential to enhance relationships when used thoughtfully.
183;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Attending a live performance (a play, concert, sporting event, etc) is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Have you ever traveled along to support your home football team during tournaments? Have you attended at a stadium to watch your team's match, yell or even cry with the team and their thousands of fans there? If you have a great love with football and your home team, it is much more gratifying to stay side by side and cheer up the team at the stadium rather than just to stay at home and watch the match alone.First, attending a live football match is very fulfilling. Before the match starts, thousands of fans gathering outside of the stadium with team flags, colorful outfits, sound of trumpets and rattles... everywhere. As the game kicks off, the atmosphere inside the stadium is even more exciting. You are watching football stars play the game with your own eyes and sharing your feelings with about 40,000 people at the stadium, such an excitement you can never have when you are watching it at home. Everybody yells and sings together, the stadium is like bursted out whenever a goal is scored. See, you will be bored if you are watching it alone.Second, watching a live football game is an exceptional experience. You can watch it at home, but ""easy come, easy go"", you will quickly forget it, like a movie. The tickets to get in the stadium may be a little expensive, but you will gain much more entertainment value from the game. You can cherish your experience for a long time. Furthermore, it can be an exclusive experience. If it is a crucial win to acclaim a trophy, you will be ""on site"" to witness and celebrate the victory.In conclusion, watch a football match on television it is comfortable and pleasing, but watching the match live at the stadium is more enjoyable. It can be unforgettable moments in your life.";I firmly believe that attending a live performance is more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. The experience of being present in the moment, surrounded by the energy of a live audience, is unparalleled and adds an extra dimension to any performance.Firstly, live performances provide an immersive experience that cannot be replicated on a screen. When attending a concert, for example, the sensation of the music vibrating through your body, the visual effects, and the sight of the artist performing in person creates an emotional connection that is often absent when watching from home. The excitement in the air, the collective reactions of the audience, and the spontaneity of live performances generate an ambiance that enhances enjoyment. In contrast, watching on television often feels detached and lacks the emotional investment that comes with witnessing an event firsthand.Moreover, attending live events offers the opportunity to engage with fellow fans and share the moment with them. The camaraderie experienced when cheering for a favorite sports team, or joining in on the sing-along at a concert fosters a sense of community and belonging. These shared experiences often lead to cherished memories, such as singing along to a beloved song or celebrating a winning goal. In contrast, the solitary experience of viewing an event alone at home can feel isolating and less fulfilling.Additionally, live performances often feature unexpected surprises, such as celebrity guests or unscripted moments, which contribute to their excitement and allure. These instances make each performance unique and memorable. In contrast, televised events can be overly polished and predictable, lacking the spontaneity that live experiences provide.In conclusion, the thrill of attending a live performance—its immersive atmosphere, communal engagement, and unpredictability—makes it a more enjoyable experience than watching the same event on television. These elements create unforgettable memories that resonate long after the event has ended.
184;Renewable resources of energy (Sun, wind, water) will soon replace fossils fuels such as gases, oil, and coal. Do you agree or disagree?;"Although renewable resources of energy are elements of the current and future energy strategy, as far as I'm concerned, these new forms of energy cannot soon replace fossil fuels such as gases, oil, and coal.Firstly, due to the limitation of technology renewable resources are relatively expensive. Researches in renewable energy cost a huge amount of money which developing countries cannot afford. On the other hand, fossil fuels are abundant and inexpensive in many areas. For example, it is estimated that China has the largest deposit of coal in the world and the government does not want to invest too much money on new forms of energy, say expensive solar batteries and wind farms. Thus the plan of renewable resources of energy may face challenges in that not every country can afford the reforming.Besides, although utility companies claim that renewable energy is environmentally friendly; these new forms of energy may not be as clean and green as we think. Latest studies have shown that these renewable resources of energy are problematic as well and they are very likely to pose long-term environmental hazards. For example, the dams built for hydroelectricity influence the water flows of the rivers and sometimes cause drought in areas in front of the dams. This damages the habitats of many valuable fish and wading birds. More importantly, the accumulation of heavy metal in the silt on the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is extremely difficult and expensive to clean up; leaving problems for the following generations. Thus renewable resources are not as reliable as we think.Admittedly contemporarily fossil fuels cause serious environmental conundrums such as acid rain, deduction of ozone layer and global warming; these problems can be solved by improving efficiency of the mechanism and reducing emissions. For example we can use chemicals to desulfurize the emissions from plants and vehicles to avoid acid rain. These improving methods are often cheaper and simpler compared to the high-tech of renewable energy. With these solutions fossil fuels seem more sustainable.In conclusion as promising as renewable resources of energy sound, there is no way those new forms of energy will replace fossil fuels soon.";The transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is a subject of considerable debate and urgency in contemporary society. I firmly agree that renewable resources, including solar, wind, and hydroelectric energy, will eventually replace fossil fuels such as gas, oil, and coal. This shift is not only necessary but also inevitable due to environmental, economic, and technological factors.One of the most compelling reasons for this transition is the urgent need to combat climate change. The burning of fossil fuels has been a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which lead to global warming and catastrophic weather events. Renewable energy sources, on the other hand, offer a clean alternative that can drastically reduce carbon footprints. For instance, solar and wind energy produce electricity without the harmful emissions associated with fossil fuels.Moreover, the economic viability of renewable energy is becoming increasingly evident. The cost of technologies such as solar panels and wind turbines has plummeted over the past decade. This trend is likely to continue as innovation progresses and economies of scale are realized. Transitioning to renewable energy not only promotes job creation in industries related to energy production and maintenance but also reduces dependence on mismanaged fossil fuel markets subject to geopolitical tensions.Technological advancements also play a crucial role in facilitating this shift. Energy storage systems, like batteries, have improved significantly, enabling excess solar or wind energy to be stored and used during periods of low generation. Such innovations bolster the reliability of renewable energy sources, making them more attractive for widespread adoption.In conclusion, the urgent need for environmental sustainability, the declining costs of renewable technologies, and continued advancements in energy solutions make it clear that resources like the sun, wind, and water are not only viable alternatives to fossil fuels but will likely dominate the energy landscape in the future. Therefore, I strongly believe that the transition to renewable energy is not only possible but essential for a sustainable future.
185;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree this point of view? Why or why not. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important. The reasons are based on the following aspects.First, land used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society. There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy, because they produce plenty of profits. What is more, the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry. It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate. Thus the needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.Second, farmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life. It is clearly understood that farming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live. Especially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing. In addition, highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life. Last I want to mention is that even though farmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals, it can do good to protect the endangered animals. According to the discuss above, agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy. With the economy development, we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals. For instant, we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct.All in all, protecting endangered animals is necessary, nevertheless, human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.;The debate surrounding the prioritization of human needs versus the preservation of land for endangered animals is multifaceted and requires careful consideration of ecological balance. While human development, encompassing farmland, housing, and industry, is crucial for societal progress and economic stability, I firmly believe that we must not overlook the importance of preserving habitats for endangered species.First and foremost, the health of our ecosystems is intrinsically linked to human well-being. Biodiversity plays a critical role in maintaining environmental stability and resilience. Endangered animals are often key species in their ecosystems, and their disappearance can trigger a cascade of negative effects, including the collapse of food chains and the degradation of habitats that humans rely on for clean air, water, and resources. For instance, the decline of bee populations threatens pollination, which is essential for crops and thus for human survival.Furthermore, the expansion of farmland, housing, and industry can often occur at the expense of wildlife habitats, leading to irreversible loss of biodiversity. When we prioritize short-term human interests without considering long-term environmental impacts, we risk creating an unsustainable future. A pertinent example is the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest for agricultural and industrial purposes, which not only affects countless animal species but also contributes to climate change, ultimately impacting human livelihoods.Additionally, the preservation of endangered species can offer significant economic benefits. Eco-tourism is a growing industry that thrives on the existence of diverse wildlife. When we protect natural habitats, we not only safeguard these species but also create opportunities for economic gain through tourism and conservation efforts.In conclusion, while it is essential to address human needs, we should not disregard the importance of preserving land for endangered animals. Striking a balance between development and conservation is not only a moral responsibility but also a pragmatic approach to ensuring a sustainable future for both humans and the planet.
186;Some people think that learning a foreign language in its original country is more beneficial than learning the language in a countr with another language. Do you agree or disagree?;Although there are some advantages to learning a foreign language in its original country, I firmly believe that people who learn a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken have a deeper understanding of different language skills than those who learn the same languages in their own countries.Person 'A' who learns a non-native language in his country may receive benefit from a step-by-step teaching method. In other words, he is not jumping into the foreign country. Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language. Besides, all the learners are probably from the same country, so all these people most likely have learned the language, more or less, in the same way.On the other hand, when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken, he has the opportunity to communicate with natives. He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country. No doubt, it leads to better understanding of language essential skills. He also has access to the most up-to-date language. Thus he can learn most useful idioms, proverbs and so many other things which the former person, person 'A', does not have access to.On the whole, if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel, I would definitely make the second choice. There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language. When you are exposed to an environment where everybody talks to you in the new language you want to learn and expects you express words from the same language, you are forced to learn it as soon and good as possible.In a word, although each of these methods have their pros and cons, I am pretty sure that advantages of learning language in the country in which is spoken outweigh the advantages of the other way of learning of a new language.;Learning a foreign language is an integral part of personal and professional development in an increasingly globalized world. The debate surrounding the benefits of acquiring a language in its country of origin versus in a non-native environment is prevalent, with some arguing that immersion in the original country provides superior advantages. I largely agree with this perspective because of the combined effects of cultural immersion, practical experience, and enhanced motivation.First and foremost, learning a language in its original setting allows for complete immersion in its cultural context. This exposure enables learners to understand not only the nuances of the language itself but also the traditions, customs, and everyday life of its speakers. For instance, when learning Spanish in Spain, students can engage in conversations with locals, experience authentic dialects, and understand idiomatic expressions that may not be effectively conveyed in a classroom setting elsewhere. This cultural understanding aids retention and practical application of the language.Moreover, learning in a foreign country facilitates daily practice. Language learners have the opportunity to interact with native speakers, which reinforces language skills outside of the classroom environment. Whether ordering food, asking for directions, or participating in social events, these real-world experiences enhance fluency and confidence. In contrast, learning a language in a country where a different language is spoken may limit such interactions, often relegating students to controlled classroom scenarios.Finally, the motivation to learn a language can significantly heighten in an immersive environment. The necessity of communicating in the target language fuses urgency with exposure, compelling learners to engage actively with the language on a daily basis. For many learners, the desire to connect with locals and navigate daily life in a foreign language fosters a deeper commitment to mastering it.In conclusion, although learning a foreign language in any context can be beneficial, immersing oneself in the language's original country offers unparalleled advantages. Cultural exposure, practical usage, and heightened motivation collectively enhance the language acquisition experience, making it a more effective approach for many learners.
187;Some people say that physical exercise should be required part of every school day. Other people believe that students should spend the whole school day on academic studies. Which opinion do you agree with?;"Although some people believe that students should spend the whole day on academic studies, I nevertheless believe that physical exercise is a crucial part of every school day. Exercise is good not only for having a good health body, but also for the mind. In addition, including exercise in children's daily routine, it is a good way to teach them the importance of physical activity from an early age.Physical activity helps children to grow up physically healthier. As studies have shown that the rate of obesity in children has increased every year, it will be very beneficial for children to have a daily physical activity and get a break from being sitting several hours at school. In addition, exercise will help them to not be less exposed to illness related with cardiovascular, higher blood and cholesterol issues.Daily exercise will help also to develop children's brain function. It is well known how important it is to exercise regularly to help the body system to work better. When people exercise, the respiratory system's function is enhanced, helping all organs, including the brain, to get more oxygen in. Daily exercise will provide children with a mental break which will boost them to be efficient learners.Having children in the daily exercise routine from an early age will teach them the important value of having physical activity in their every day routine. Children are bombarded with lectures about nutrition and physical activity; however, they will be more beneficed if that knowledge can be put in practice. Moreover, they can stick with the routine and make the daily physical activities a good habit on their whole life. Including physical activity in children's school day should be strongly considered. It will meliorate not only mental and body health, but also will establish in children a habit of doing it, giving them the opportunity to measure the worth of including such an important activity in their daily live schedules.";The debate over whether physical exercise should be a mandatory part of every school day versus focusing solely on academic studies is one that has gained considerable attention in recent years. I firmly believe that integrating physical exercise into the daily school routine is essential for the holistic development of students.Firstly, physical exercise plays a crucial role in promoting the overall health and well-being of students. In an age where sedentary lifestyles are increasingly prevalent due to technology, it is vital to encourage children and adolescents to be active. Regular physical activity has been linked to numerous health benefits, including improved cardiovascular fitness, stronger muscles and bones, and better weight management. By incorporating exercise into the school day, educational institutions can help combat obesity and related health issues that many young people face today.Moreover, physical exercise contributes significantly to mental health. Engaging in sports and fitness activities can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, enhance mood, and increase self-esteem among students. When students participate in regular physical activity, they often experience improved concentration and cognitive function, which can lead to better academic performance. Thus, exercise can be seen not merely as a physical outlet but as a vital component that supports and enhances academic learning.Lastly, physical activity fosters essential life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and leadership. Through sports and group exercises, students learn to work collaboratively, develop resilience, and manage stress, which are critical skills that go beyond the classroom and prepare them for future challenges in life. In conclusion, while academic studies are undoubtedly important, prioritizing physical exercise in schools is essential for fostering healthier, happier, and well-rounded individuals. A balanced approach that values both academics and physical fitness will ultimately equip students with the tools they need to succeed in all aspects of life.
188;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think is a good idea? Support your opinion with specific details.;In my opinion, it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students. Although, many argue that it provide good working experience, but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways. Having jobs would affect the health of the student. It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life.A student has to do lots of studies in today's competitive world to prove himself. He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades. If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time, then it would cause an extra burden on them. Furthermore, jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on. This would result in stress, tension and tiredness. They won't be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep. Thus, would affect their mental and physical health.Another reason, jobs can divert students from their studies. If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money. They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money. This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies. Moreover, they drop out their studies so as to earn more money.In addition to this, the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time. He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends, clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others. They have whole life to do job and prove themselves, but the childhood phase will never return in their life. Therefore, they should take advantage of life as much possible they can.Thus, for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies. Having job would affect their health, divert them from studies and take away one of the important phase from their life.;In recent years, the phenomenon of teenagers holding jobs while still in school has sparked significant debate across various nations. While some argue that part-time work detracts from academic performance, I firmly believe that having a job during adolescence can offer invaluable benefits and should be encouraged, provided it is managed wisely.First and foremost, working while studying helps teenagers develop essential life skills. Juggling work responsibilities and academic obligations requires effective time management, organizational skills, and prioritization. These competencies are crucial not only for academic success but also for future career endeavors. For instance, a teenager who manages to work part-time while keeping up with school assignments learns to balance multiple commitments — an invaluable skill in today’s fast-paced world.Moreover, engaging in part-time employment allows teenagers to gain practical experience and insight into the working world. It exposes them to the realities of professional environments and fosters a sense of responsibility and independence. For example, a student working as a cashier or in a restaurant learns about customer service, teamwork, and financial management — experiences that go beyond classroom learning and enrich personal development.Additionally, having a job can ease financial burdens for teenagers and their families. Many students contribute to their expenses, whether it’s for school supplies, extracurricular activities, or savings for college. This financial awareness cultivates a sense of responsibility and appreciation for money management, which is crucial as they transition into adulthood.On the other hand, it is essential to strike a balance between work and academics. Excessive working hours can lead to burnout and negatively impact school performance. Therefore, schools and parents should guide students in finding suitable job opportunities that do not compromise their educational aspirations.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns regarding the potential drawbacks of teenagers working during their studies, the benefits of skill development, practical experience, and financial independence far outweigh these concerns. With appropriate guidance and support, part-time employment can serve as a vital stepping stone for teenagers on their path to adulthood.
189;Some people believe that zoos serve useful function. Other people believe that it's cruel & wrong to confine animals in zoos. Tell which point of view you are agree with.;It has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos. Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment. Over the time, there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals.Some people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos. First of all, zoos are fascinating places of entertainment. For this point, they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure. Another function that all zoos serve relates to education. Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world. Moreover, some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct.On the other hand, there are, however, people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals. Being confined, animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented. In their opinion, zoos are some kind of prisons and it's so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons.From my point of view, I agree with the first group. In modern life, zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers. Besides, recently, zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature, taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity.;The debate over the usefulness of zoos versus the ethics of confining animals is a complex and nuanced issue. While it is true that zoos can play a significant role in conservation, education, and research, I align with the perspective that the confinement of animals in zoos generally raises ethical concerns that outweigh the potential benefits.Zoos often argue that they contribute to animal conservation, particularly for endangered species. They engage in breeding programs intended to increase population numbers and reintroduce animals into the wild. While this is a noble goal, the reality is that many zoos operate merely as entertainment destinations, prioritizing profit over genuine conservation efforts. Furthermore, studies have shown that animals bred in captivity often struggle to adapt to life in the wild, undermining the effectiveness of these efforts.Moreover, the ethical implications of confining animals cannot be ignored. Many species display complex behaviors indicative of their high intelligence and social structures, yet in zoos, they are often confined to restrictive enclosures that fail to mimic their natural habitats. This lack of space and stimulation can lead to psychological distress and abnormal behaviors, known as zoochosis. It raises a significant moral question: Is it justifiable to confine creatures with such intricate lives for the sake of human education or enjoyment?In addition, advancements in technology have provided alternative ways to educate the public about wildlife. Virtual reality, documentaries, and wildlife observations in natural habitats allow people to connect with nature without the ethical dilemmas posed by zoos.In conclusion, while zoos may offer some educational and conservation benefits, the moral ramifications of animal confinement are substantial. Instead of supporting environments that may harm animals, we should advocate for more compassionate and effective alternatives that respect their natural behaviors and habitats.
190;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;When I found the chance of studying in a group with my classmates, I wished I can go back in time and took all my exams again. I personally prefer studying in a group due to these noticeable features, getting help from other students, improving my attitude for learning, managing my time in an effective way.When pupils make a group for studying, all member of group have the same chance to help each other. They can work together for understanding the complicated aspect of a course. For example, when a group faces with complex math problem, they can share their opinions to solve it. In addition, such a remarkable effect has incorporation that all students can improve their weak points in a group. Increasing the motivation and competence spirit are another benefit of group-studying. In a group of student, the best of those always encourages others to study harder. Besides, pupils often have a tangible competence in order that they can get the highest grade in a group. Clearly, better learning is one of noticeable result of these competences and encouragements. When the students study with their friends, they should have schedule to use their time in an effective manner. Group-studying causes some kind of internal obligation to manage the time, inasmuch as we always care about other people and we do not want to waste their time. Therefore, time management is another brilliant benefit of group-studying. In conclusion, I strongly prefer studying in a group of my friends because of some important opportunities gaining with this activity. I can receive some helps from other student as well as improving my learning skills, also managing of time is another achievements of group-studying. Now, it is time to start without any regret from my previous exams.;The preference for studying alone versus studying in a group is often a reflection of individual learning styles and personalities. Personally, I prefer studying alone due to several compelling reasons that enhance my educational experience.Firstly, studying alone allows for greater focus and concentration. When I am in a quiet environment without the distractions that often accompany group study sessions, such as side conversations or differences in work pace, I can dive deeply into my material. For example, during exam preparation, I find that I can cover topics more thoroughly and retain information better when I am working at my own rhythm. This undisturbed focus enables me to engage more critically with the material at hand, enhancing my comprehension and retention.Moreover, studying alone grants me the flexibility to tailor my study sessions according to my needs. I can choose what subjects to focus on, how long to spend on each topic, and I can take breaks when I feel it's necessary without having to conform to a group's schedule. Last semester, when grappling with complex math concepts, I was able to dedicate extra time to practice problems that challenged me, a luxury I might not have had in a group setting where time is often divided among various subjects and individual needs.Additionally, solitary study fosters independence and self-reliance, qualities that are essential not just in academic pursuits but throughout life. As I navigate my own educational journey, I develop the ability to seek resources, troubleshoot problems, and build confidence in my answers without relying on others.In contrast, while group study can be beneficial for collaboration and different perspectives, I find that the drawbacks often outweigh the advantages in my case. Therefore, studying alone aligns perfectly with my focus, flexibility, and self-discipline, ultimately leading to a more effective and fulfilling learning experience.
191;Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends. Other choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Compare the advantages of each choice. Which of these two ways of spending time do you prefer? Use specific reasons to support your answers.;Despite friendship is one of the most important values in a man's life, people might have different preferences: some of them prefer to spend time with one or two close friends, while other prefer to be surrounded by a large number of friends. In my view, I prefer the second attitude.The first reason is that staying in contact with a large number of friends gives the opportunity to learn more from the others' experiences. For instance, among a large number of people there could be someone who practices a particular sport, or plays an instrument or likes traveling very much and from their experiences you can be attracted to try something new that you had never considered before. Of course, while differences give the opportunity to learn, they can also mean that sometimes it can be difficult to reach an agreement. This would not happen or at least would happen rarely if one decides to spend time with one or two close friends. In fact, in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same.Another reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded. For example, if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice, your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages.When you have just few close friends, on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more, but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours, adding less to your experience.In sum, although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points, I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life.;"The choice between spending time with a few close friends and mingling with a larger group presents different advantages, each catering to varying personal preferences and social needs. When individuals opt for a small circle of close friends, their interactions are often more meaningful and intimate. This choice allows for deeper conversations, emotional support, and trust building. With fewer people involved, it becomes easier to share personal thoughts, seek advice, and engage in activities that may require a higher level of comfort and understanding. Close friends are often more attuned to each other’s feelings, which fosters a nurturing environment where individuals feel valued and understood.On the other hand, choosing to socialize with a larger group of friends can introduce a wider range of perspectives and experiences. This option is conducive to building a more extensive social network, thus enhancing one’s social skills and adaptability. Group settings can also create a lively atmosphere filled with shared laughter and diverse activities that might not occur in smaller gatherings. Additionally, a broader friend group can serve as a safety net; if one friendship fades, there are many others to rely upon.Personally, I prefer spending time with a small circle of close friends. This preference stems from my belief in the quality of relationships over quantity. In smaller groups, I find it easier to establish a strong bond, offer support when my friends face challenges, and engage in discussions that lead to mutual growth. Occasionally, I enjoy the vibrancy of larger gatherings, but the deeper connections I cultivate with a few special people bring me more fulfillment and happiness.In conclusion, both options hold unique benefits, with intimate small gatherings fostering deep connections, while larger groups provide social diversity. Ultimately, one’s personal inclinations dictate the preferable choice in how time is spent with friends."
192;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways or should government spend more money on improving public transportation (Buses, trains,subways)?;The development of public transportation is the most essential thing for a developed society. Public transportation keeps society from the depletion of natural resources, the air pollution, the loss of a sense of community. So, I think the government have to spend more money on improving it.The use of public transportation is the best way to conserve natural resources gradually run out. Cars depend on oil and gasoline to move. If people use too many private cars, the oil and gasoline nonrenewable will run out quickly. Instead of using many private cars, people can use public transportation, such as bus, train, subway, each one can get far more people and less oil and gasoline are used up per person.The use of public transportation helps in reducing the air pollution. Cars use oil and gasoline and send out gas such as carbon dioxide, heat and so on. They cause pollution and make the Earth warmer. The more cars are driven, the more pollution will be put into air. If we use the public transportation, less cars will be used and less pollution will be emitted. The atmosphere, surrounding us, will be protected and help us more healthy.The use of public transportation make us live more sociable. When we drive a private car, we are alone or only our family members that we already know and lost the opportunity to make friends with others or to see that we are a part of this society. When using public transportation, we have a chance to meet more people and more chances to discovery new aspects of life.Using public transportation has a lot of advantages for the modern society facing a lot of problems: the environmental population, the isolation in life, the depletion of natural resources. So, the government have to invest more for it and encourage people to use.;The debate over whether government funds should be allocated towards improving roads and highways or enhancing public transportation is a significant issue in contemporary urban planning and infrastructure management. Both options present compelling arguments, but a balanced investment in public transportation offers a sustainable and forward-thinking solution to mobility issues faced by growing populations.Firstly, investing in public transportation systems—such as buses, trains, and subways—addresses several critical societal challenges. With urbanization on the rise, city populations are swelling, leading to increased congestion on roadways. Enhancing public transportation can alleviate this burden by providing an efficient and reliable alternative to personal vehicles. Studies have shown that cities with robust public transit networks experience lower levels of traffic congestion, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, and improved air quality, ultimately contributing to healthier urban environments.Moreover, public transportation promotes social equity. It provides a means for those without access to private vehicles—many of whom are low-income individuals—to commute to work, access education, and engage in community activities. This democratization of mobility fosters economic opportunities and helps bridge social divides.Conversely, spending excessively on road and highway improvements may lead to short-term relief but fails to address long-term sustainability. Expanding roadways can encourage further car dependence and urban sprawl, resulting in more traffic and pollution in the long run. Additionally, increased expenditures on highways can drain resources away from public transit initiatives, leading to a less integrated transportation ecosystem.In conclusion, while maintaining and improving roads and highways remains essential, prioritizing public transportation investment is crucial for fostering sustainable urban development. By championing public transit, governments can create cleaner, more efficient, and equitable cities—ultimately providing a foundation for resilient communities in the future.
193;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Animals should be free, people should not keep them in zoos. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people state that zoos are a great asset to animals. Others believe that they are inferior creatures and therefore do not deserve our attention. In my opinion, we must help animals live safely and comfortably in their own environment.Many scientific studies have revealed the detriment that zoos have caused to animals. Firstly, like we, human beings, animals are delivered to this world with genetic instincts. Skills which help them live and survive in their residing areas. When we captivate animals and put them to live a style of life that they are unfamiliar with, they begin to loose those in-born instincts. Hence, when they are released or in the worst case, when they escape, they act disorientated and this contributes to the animal mortality rate. In addition to the previous point, various zoos do not have the proper implements or policies that assure the quality of animal care. For instance, I recall my first trip to a zoo, at age eight. I was shocked by the cruelty which animals were treated. I can not think of any staff memeber who did not have an improper behaviour towards the animlas in the zoo. They beat them up because they did not wanted to eat their meals and then excused themselves saying that it was a way to train the animals.In conclusion, I strongly believe that we have to assit animals and provide them the best quality of life possible. Scientific facts showed the damage that zoos can inflict on animals. Moreover, many zoos do not meet the standards of care required for them.;The debate surrounding the captivity of animals in zoos has gained traction in recent years, with a growing consensus leaning towards the idea that animals should be free rather than confined. I strongly agree with the statement that animals should not be kept in zoos, as this confinement deprives them of their natural behaviors, habitats, and the right to live freely.Firstly, animals in zoos often suffer from a lack of space and stimulation, leading to psychological issues. In their natural habitats, animals engage in complex behaviors necessary for survival, such as hunting, foraging, and social interactions. In contrast, zoo environments can be restrictive and artificial, which fails to meet their emotional and physical needs. For instance, elephants, known for their migratory nature, can develop severe behavioral problems like pacing or aggression when confined to small enclosures. Moreover, zoos often prioritize entertainment over animal welfare. The primary aim of a zoo is to attract visitors, which can lead to compromised living conditions for the animals. Exotic species are often showcased to create a spectacle, but this can marginalize the animals’ natural instincts and diminish their dignity. An example of this is the infamous case of polar bears kept in warm climates, where the animals struggle to adapt, leading to health issues.Furthermore, the argument that zoos serve educational purposes falls short. While zoos may provide a platform for learning about wildlife, they fail to offer an authentic understanding of these animals in their natural environments. Effective conservation should focus on protecting habitats and ecosystems rather than keeping animals in captivity.In conclusion, I firmly believe that animals should be free and not kept in zoos. Their confinement leads to adverse psychological effects, compromises their well-being, and does not represent true conservation. Instead, we should advocate for initiatives that protect natural habitats and allow wildlife to thrive in their own environments.
194;A university plans to develop a new research center in your country. Some people want a center for business research. Other people want a center for research in agriculture (farming). Which of these two kinds of research centers do you recommend for your country? Use specific reasons in your recommendation.;Most of the universities in the world seek to develop some research in some countries. These researches can be aimed for several fields such as business or agriculture. If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research, I would opt for the second one.First of all, my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture. Most of these lands are left without any treatment. The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land. This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land. Especially, if they have no knowledge or education in this field.Secondly, the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve. The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part. The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products. For example, the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country. The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product, how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms.Another reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs. Obviously, showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money. Some people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field. For me being a developed country does not mean that we have to focus only in business, but we have to focus on what really bring us to the level of self satisfaction, and the agriculture for our country is the field that can realize that.My country need to focus more on the agriculture by establishing centers for research in this field, which will have some very positive consequences on agriculture people work, on the economy and on the employment.;In the context of my country’s developmental needs and economic prospects, I recommend prioritizing the establishment of a research center for agriculture. While business research can undoubtedly contribute to economic growth, agriculture is a foundational element of our economy, sustenance, and environmental sustainability. Focusing on agricultural research will yield significant benefits for both immediate and long-term challenges faced by our society.First and foremost, agriculture is the backbone of our economy, employing a large portion of the population and providing food security. By investing in agricultural research, we can enhance crop yields, develop sustainable agricultural practices, and integrate modern technology into farming. This not only ensures that we can meet the food demands of our population but also improves the livelihood of countless farmers who rely on traditional methods that have not adapted to changing climatic conditions.Moreover, agricultural research can facilitate the exploration of innovative solutions addressing pressing environmental issues such as soil degradation, water scarcity, and climate change. For instance, research into drought-resistant crops and sustainable pest management systems can help farmers mitigate the impacts of climate variability. These advancements will lead to a more resilient agricultural sector capable of maintaining productivity in the face of environmental challenges.Lastly, supporting an agricultural research center could help boost our country’s global standing. As countries increasingly focus on sustainability and food security, having a dedicated center for agriculture puts us in a position to contribute to international dialogues on best practices and innovations in farming. This, in turn, could attract partnerships and funding from international agencies, leading to further developments and opportunities for collaboration.In conclusion, while a business research center may bring some benefits, prioritizing a research center in agriculture will have far-reaching implications for economic stability, environmental sustainability, and food security. This focus aligns with our country’s fundamental needs and offers a pathway toward a more resilient future for both farmers and the broader community.
195;People learn in different ways. Some people learn by doing things, other people learn by reading about things, others learn by listening to people talk about things. Which of these methods of learning is best for you? Use specific examples to support your choice.;People have a lot of things to learn in their lives. They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills. One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about. There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives.First of all, learning by doing things develops our maturity. When you do things by your self, you learn to depend on yourself. You will not be in need to refer to books or persons. The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity. For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader, they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group, or even a situation. We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading. Secondly, learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about. There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them. Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing. People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming. Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming.Another reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things. With the time, Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring. Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things. So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them.The history shows that learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things. People should not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn. They should try and keep trying until they learn what they want to learn.;Learning is a multifaceted process, and individuals often have diverse preferences that shape how they absorb information. Personally, I find that hands-on experience, or learning by doing, is the most effective method for me. This experiential approach not only engages my senses but also solidifies concepts in a tangible way that reading or listening cannot achieve.For instance, during my time in high school, I had the opportunity to participate in a science fair project. Instead of merely reading about chemical reactions in a textbook, I conducted experiments to observe them firsthand. This active involvement enabled me to understand the principles of chemistry far better than I could have through passive learning. By mixing various substances and meticulously noting the outcomes, I witnessed the fascinating transformations that occurred. This experience made the concepts vivid and memorable, reinforcing my understanding of how different reactants interacted.Moreover, I also experienced this learning style during my internship at a local community center, where I was tasked with organizing events. While there were initial guidelines provided through training sessions, the real learning occurred when I was involved in the actual planning and execution of these events. This immersive experience allowed me to refine my organizational skills, adapt to challenges on the spot, and learn from my mistakes—insights that would have remained abstract had I only read about event planning.In conclusion, while various learning methods, such as reading and listening, have their merits, learning by doing resonates most with me. This approach not only deepens my understanding but also fosters critical skills that are essential in practical applications. As I continue my educational journey, I will consciously seek opportunities for experiential learning, as I believe this method will lead to more profound and lasting knowledge.
196;Many people think that cheap air travel should be encouraged because it gives ordinary people the freedom to travel further. However, others think that this leads to environmental problem, and so air travel should be more expensive in order to discourage people from having it. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;In recent years, many airlines offer to their customers more and more number of cheap flights. People have various different views about cheap air travel. Although there are good arguments in favour of this trend should be encouraged, I personally think that cheap flight can make many serious problem.It is undeniable that cheap air fares have broadened travel possibilities for many people, particularly for the lower income group. These days, millions of people can travel around the world for work or pleasure. They can develop their careers, broad their knowledge, and interact with many other people from varied cultural backgrounds. Moreover, travels also help to promote the tourist industry development, boost the economy and job markets of many countries.On the other hand, growing of cheap flights really have negative impact on environment. Apparently, more flights could mean bigger and busier airport that may be grown the air pollution for people who live and work close to it. However, the biggest concern is the effect on global warming. Burning plane fuel can releases carbon dioxide into environment that cause the Earth to heat up. In fact, while many efforts are being made to reduce CO2 emissions from cars and factories, nothing is being done to reins the airlines. In conclusion, I would argue that the drawbacks of cheap air fares outweigh the benefits. However, it does not mean that air travel should be more expensive. Instead, people should be aware of their responsibility to reduce the emissions caused by their lifestyle choices.;"The debate surrounding cheap air travel is multifaceted, encompassing the advantages of increased accessibility for ordinary people and the environmental consequences that accompany such widespread activity. Proponents of affordable airfare argue that it democratizes travel, allowing individuals from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds to explore new destinations. This accessibility fosters cultural exchanges, encourages tourism in underprivileged areas, and broadens personal horizons, enhancing the global economy. For many, the ability to travel is not only a luxury but also an opportunity for self-discovery and adventure, which ultimately contributes to a more interconnected world.Conversely, opponents highlight the environmental repercussions of mass air travel. The aviation industry is a significant contributor to carbon emissions, which exacerbates climate change and affects air quality. As air travel becomes increasingly affordable, more people are flying, leading to greater air traffic and heightened strain on the planet’s resources. Environmentalists argue that this surge in low-cost flights could undermine efforts to combat climate change, and suggest that pricing air travel at a higher rate might discourage unnecessary flights, promoting more sustainable methods of transportation such as trains or buses.In my opinion, while affordable air travel offers undeniable benefits, it is essential that we strike a balance between accessibility and environmental sustainability. Encouraging responsible travel through carbon pricing or incentives for eco-friendly modes of transport would allow individuals to explore the world without significant harm to the environment. Furthermore, promoting awareness of the ecological impact of flying could inspire travelers to make more conscientious decisions when planning their journeys. Ultimately, supporting sustainable practices does not negate the freedom to travel; it ensures that future generations can enjoy the same experiences without compromising the health of the planet."
197;Should governments spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation(buses, trains, subways)? Why?Ê;Many people think that governments should spend money on improving roads and highways while the others say that it would be better to spend money on public transportation. In my opinion, governments should certainly spend money on the public transportation system because it would deal with problems that the rising number of private cars is creating.First, the using of public transportation reduces the amount of resources using on transportation. Cars depend on gasoline, which is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, the more cars we use means that the faster gasoline in this world is used up. In the contrary, if the public transportation is efficiently used, the amount of gasoline consuming per person will be much lower. And this definitely helps to reserve our invaluable natural resource, gasoline.Second, public transportation helps to solve the air pollution problems. Averagely, public transports use much less gasoline to carry people than private cars. It means that by using public transports, the less gas exhaust is pumped to the air and people will no longer have to bear the stuffy situation on the roads, which is always full of fumes.Last but not least, using public transportation is much safer than private transportation. According to National Safety Council, riding the bus is over 170 times safer than private care. Thus there is no reason that governments should hesitate to invest in public transportation, a healthy, safe and economical way of transporting.In short, I can say for certain that spending money on improving public transportation is necessary because it is the key to protect our world, creating a healthy and safe environment for people to live in.;The question of whether governments should allocate more funds to improving roads and highways or public transportation systems is a critical one that hinges on a multitude of factors, including environmental sustainability, urban development, and the overall efficiency of transportation networks. While both avenues require investment, it is increasingly clear that emphasis should be placed on enhancing public transportation.One primary reason for investing in public transportation is its potential to reduce traffic congestion and its accompanying environmental toll. Roads and highways, while essential for moving goods and individuals, often lead to urban sprawl and increased reliance on personal vehicles. By improving public transit infrastructure—such as buses, trains, and subways—governments can provide attractive alternatives to single-occupancy vehicles. Effective public transportation systems can significantly decrease the number of cars on the road, leading to reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality. This is particularly important in the context of climate change, as cities strive to meet sustainability goals.Moreover, investing in public transportation can bolster social equity. Many low-income individuals lack access to private vehicles, making reliable public transit essential for reaching employment opportunities, schools, and healthcare facilities. By prioritizing public transport, governments can promote inclusivity and economic mobility, ultimately benefiting society as a whole.Furthermore, improved public transportation can stimulate economic growth by creating jobs and enhancing accessibility to various regions. A well-connected transit system can attract businesses and encourage local development, leading to a more vibrant economy.In conclusion, while upgrading roads and highways is undeniably necessary, the long-term benefits of investing in public transportation—through environmental sustainability, improving social equity, and stimulating economic growth—make it the more prudent choice for government spending. As urban populations continue to rise, the need for efficient, reliable, and sustainable transportation options will only become more pressing.
198;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer?;Everyone has their method to success in life. At school or university, success depends on how we study. Some students benefit a lot when they study with groups. Yet, I prefer to study individually because it helps me to concentrate more, and it helps me to build my personality.Studying alone helps us to focus more in our lessons. For instance, I am a type of person who cannot comprehend my subjects unless I am alone. I can prepare my schedules, guidelines, exercises and go over them all. Moreover, we have a lot of subjects which require us to sit and study alone such as math, reading, and drawing. In my opinion, I can take advantage of every minute without wasting by studying alone.Additionally, we are building our personalities when we study alone. For example, answering our homework alone encourages us to be more responsible and independent. Also, it motivates us to be accurate in our work in the future. Personally, when I fix my study plan with a specific time and finish it on time, it improves my ability in the future to become more precise and careful. To conclude, there are many ways to study and it is our right to choose which is suitable for our characters whether alone or with group. In fact, I agree with the idea of studying a lone since it helps me to focus more and establish my personality. Success needs us to work hard and sacrifice more whether we choose to study alone or with group.;"The debate over whether to study alone or in groups is a common one among students, each approach having its unique advantages. Personally, I prefer to study alone, as it allows me the freedom to concentrate deeply, tailor my studying methods to my personal needs, and work at my own pace.Studying alone fosters an environment of intense concentration. When I engage in solitary studying, there are fewer distractions, whether from conversations or varying opinions. This focused approach enables me to delve deeply into complex topics, grasp intricate concepts, and efficiently retain information. For instance, while preparing for exams, I often find solace in a quiet space where I can review lecture notes and textbooks without interruptions. This undisturbed setting enhances my comprehension and helps me absorb knowledge more effectively.Moreover, studying solo allows me to customize my study techniques. Different students have diverse learning styles; while some might benefit from discussion and explanation, I find that visual aids, flashcards, and writing notes are most effective for my learning. This personalized methodology can be more satisfying and productive, as I can experiment with various techniques without adjusting to the group's consensus. For example, during my last history exam preparation, I created mind maps that helped connect themes and timelines, an approach that would have been compromised in a group setting.Finally, studying alone helps me build independence and self-discipline. I learn to manage my time efficiently, set personal goals, and overcome challenges independently. This skill not only aids in academic success but also prepares me for future professional responsibilities.While group studying can foster collaboration and diverse perspectives, I believe that studying alone best aligns with my academic preferences and learning style, allowing me to optimize my potential and achieve my goals effectively."
199;Some people believe that the Earth is being harmed (damaged) by human activity. Others feel that human activity makes the Earth a better place to live. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Whether human activity is making the Earth a better place to live or damaging it is a debatable issue. Some people advocate the idea that human activity is advantageously influencing to the Earth. However, I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet, for human are polluting the Earth's environment, exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species.People are corrupting their ecosphere. In recent decades, concurrently with the increase of human consume, the waste discarded by human also multiplies. These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a ""new"" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage. Furthermore, the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air, causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain, global warming or climate change.Besides, people are draining the Earth's natural resources. These resources such as oil, coal are vital for human activity, therefore nowadays, the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people. Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after, the Earth's natural resources are totally exhausted. At that time, human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources.Also, people are endangering other species' live. Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food. Through million years of hunting, especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite, people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct. Moreover, people, suffering from the population pressure, are expanding their living area; consequently, the living area of other species narrowed. This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction.All in all, from discussed reasons, we can conclude that human activity are gradually destroy the Earth since it is polluting the Earth environment, depleting the resource and imperiling other species' lives.";The debate surrounding the impact of human activity on the Earth is a nuanced one, with valid arguments on both sides. However, I firmly believe that human activity has significantly harmed the planet, leading to detrimental consequences that outweigh any positive contributions.To begin with, industrialization has wreaked havoc on the environment. The earth's atmosphere has been adversely affected by greenhouse gas emissions from factories, vehicles, and power plants. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), these emissions are a major driver of climate change, leading to extreme weather conditions, rising sea levels, and loss of biodiversity. The increasing frequency of natural disasters demonstrates that the planet is struggling to cope with the effects of human activity.Moreover, deforestation caused by logging, agriculture, and urban expansion has resulted in the destruction of vital ecosystems. Forests, which act as carbon sinks, are being depleted at an alarming rate. The loss of trees not only contributes to increased carbon dioxide levels but also endangers numerous species that rely on these habitats for survival. The extinction of species disrupts the delicate balance of our ecosystems, posing further risks to our own survival.Conversely, proponents of human progress argue that advancements in technology and infrastructure have improved living standards. While it is true that medical and technological innovations can enhance quality of life, these benefits often come at a high environmental cost. For instance, the conveniences of modern life often lead to increased waste and pollution, undermining the very foundations of a healthy planet.In conclusion, while human activity has facilitated an improved quality of life in certain aspects, the overwhelming evidence of environmental degradation suggests that we are harming the Earth more than helping it. To secure a sustainable future for generations to come, we must acknowledge the impact of our actions, adopt more eco-friendly practices, and prioritize the health of our planet.
200;A company is going to give some money either to support the arts or protect the environment. Which do you think the company chooses? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"If I had the opportunity to help a company make a decision on spending money either on supporting the arts or helping the environment, I would choose the latter without hesitation for the reasons below. First, conservation is more urgent now than at any time in history. According to a statistic conducted by the International Animal Preserving Association, we have only ten percent of the animals that have ever existed, which means that the biodiversity of our home is grievously endangered. What's more, rising sea levels, caused by global warming, have reached a level that is threatening human's life in many countries. If we continue discharging carbon dioxide with non-environmentally friendly cars, nations like Japan will be submerged and weather patterns could change, causing flooding, drought, and an increasing amount of damaging storms. In short, the ecosystem is in its worst condition ever and if we didn't take harsh measures now, we never will.Furthermore, supporting environment protection will benefit the company eventually. Nowadays, an increasing amount of people pay more attention to conservation; therefore, sponsoring conservation is a more efficient method of advertising. Just imagine if the project your company is sponsoring effectively improves the environment, then your company would be known as an environmentally-friendly company and benefit from it in this consumer-oriented society.Finally, conservation leads us to a higher standard of living. I confess that art is one of the best ways of entertaining human beings, but, with exhaust fumes and acid rain, we do not have the energy and enthusiasm to appreciate the paintings or photographs. Biodiversity and a more beautiful nature are not only the results of abetter environment but also are the necessities of photography and other types of art.To sum up, although supporting art will benefit the human beings and the company in short-term interest, I still hold the environment protection for long-term interest.";"When faced with the decision to allocate funds either to support the arts or to protect the environment, a company must consider the potential long-term impact of its choice. Given the increasing urgency of environmental issues, I believe the company will choose to protect the environment, and there are several compelling reasons for this decision.First and foremost, the current global climate crisis has heightened awareness and urgency surrounding environmental issues. From extreme weather events to biodiversity loss, the consequences of neglecting environmental protection are apparent. Companies are increasingly recognizing their responsibility to contribute to sustainability and eco-friendly practices. By choosing to invest in environmental initiatives, the company can play a pivotal role in combatting climate change, helping to ensure a healthier planet for future generations.Moreover, supporting the environment can enhance the company’s image and appeal to a broader customer base. Consumers today are more conscious of corporate social responsibility and prefer to engage with businesses that demonstrate a commitment to sustainable practices. By investing in environmental protection, the company not only contributes positively to society but also builds brand loyalty and trust with environmentally minded consumers.Additionally, funding environmental projects can create opportunities for innovation. Investing in renewable energy, conservation technologies, and sustainable agriculture can attract talented individuals and foster creative solutions. This shift towards sustainability can foster economic growth while addressing pressing issues, offering a win-win scenario for both the company and the planet.In contrast, while funding the arts is undoubtedly valuable for cultural preservation and community enrichment, it may not hold the same immediate urgency as environmental protection in today’s context. The intertwining of environmental health and the quality of life affects all social aspects, including the arts; a damaged environment can impede artistic expression and the appreciation of cultural outputs.In conclusion, given the pressing nature of environmental challenges, the positive business implications, and the potential for innovative growth, I firmly believe that the company will choose to invest in protecting the environment."
201;We all work or will work in our jobs with many different kinds of people. In your opinion, what are some important characteristics of a co-worker (Someone you work closely with) ? Use reasons and specific examples to explain why these characteristics are important.Ê;At work, you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment. However, the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you, and in most instances you have to rely on him or her. Therefore in my view, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.The co-workers should be cooperative with one another. If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes. I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious. Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not. Most of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person. However, one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor. When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse. From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility. Therefore, I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment.The co-workers need to trust each other. They should not act on suspicion. This is a very important aspect in the work environment. I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me. To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him. However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me. But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department. Finally, the co-workers should believe in fellowship. This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships. After all, you spend most of your day at office. If you have a good company in office, it is certainly a blessing.;In today’s diverse and dynamic work environments, having effective co-workers can significantly influence productivity, morale, and overall job satisfaction. Several key characteristics define an exceptional co-worker, including communication skills, reliability, and adaptability.First and foremost, effective communication skills are vital. A co-worker who can articulate ideas clearly and listen attentively fosters an environment where collaboration thrives. For instance, in a marketing team, if one member expresses creative concepts and provides constructive feedback, it encourages dialogue and innovation. The ability to communicate not only streamlines tasks but also reduces misunderstandings, leading to more efficient project outcomes. Thus, a good co-worker should prioritize ongoing dialogue and clarify expectations to promote a collective effort.Reliability is another essential trait in a co-worker. Individuals who consistently meet deadlines and uphold their responsibilities create a sense of trust within a team. For example, if one member of a research team is known for submitting well-researched data on time, it reassures others that their collective goals will be met. This dependability is crucial, particularly in high-stakes projects where every team member’s contribution is interconnected. When coworkers can depend on each other, it significantly enhances productivity and fosters a supportive work culture.Additionally, adaptability is a crucial quality, especially in fast-paced environments where change is constant. A co-worker who embraces challenges and adjusts to new circumstances can help the entire team navigate unanticipated obstacles. For instance, in the tech industry, when a product development plan shifts due to emerging trends, an adaptable co-worker can pivot strategies and ensure that the project stays on track. Their willingness to embrace change not only alleviates stress but also drives innovation.In conclusion, a successful co-worker embodies effective communication, reliability, and adaptability. These characteristics significantly contribute to a positive work atmosphere and lead to both individual and collective success in any organization.
202;When people succeed it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success. Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above? Use specific reasons and examples to explain your position.;There are many instances that luck has brought people things that they never could even imagine. However, I do not see any rational in believing in luck to reach one's goals. Therefore I strongly agree with the argument that it is one's hard work that helps him reach his target.First, if you depend only on luck for all your accomplishments, you are taking a great risk. Luck is something intangible and no one can guarantee that it would ever come your way. If it doesn't work, it would be a great disappointment. Instead if you strive hard to achieve what you want, then your hard work would take you at least closer to your final goal. In my personal experience, all my accomplishments were backed by my hard work, not my luck. And I never did encounter any disappointments of missing my goals.Secondly, if you believe that hard work is the key to success, it would make you a visionary person. In other words, those who believe in hard work are clear about their goals and know about their final destination. They carefully organize the process of achieving their targets and continue to evaluate their progress until they reach the final goal. If you believe in luck, you would be clueless about where you are heading. For example, a friend of mine, who had severe financial constraints, had the habit of buying lottery tickets thinking that one day he would win a lottery. He was living in an illusion that he can solve his financial issues with this lottery. However, up to this day his luck has not appeared and problems have got further worsened. Thirdly, if you work hard, luck too might shine on you and take you some more steps further ahead from your actual target. For example, my boss worked tirelessly for his promotion. He looked at every aspect that he needed to qualify for the promotion. He realized that having a master's degree would be a great credential for him to outperform his competitors. Although he had many commitments at home and work, he somehow managed to complete this degree before he was eligible to apply. At the end he was not only able to get the promotion amidst a stiff competition but also got nominated for a foreign scholarship since he had more credentials than other officers in his capacity. Although it is good to be lucky, depending on luck for everything is not good. Hence I strongly believe in hard working that would not easily disappoint you as luck sometimes does.;The belief that success is solely the product of hard work, devoid of any influence from luck, is a contentious topic. While I acknowledge the significance of diligent effort in achieving goals, I disagree with the notion that luck plays no role in success. A more nuanced perspective recognizes that success is often a complex interplay of hard work and fortunate circumstances.First and foremost, hard work is undeniably essential in fostering success. Individuals who dedicate themselves to their pursuits—whether in academics, sports, or business—are more likely to develop the skills, resilience, and discipline needed to excel. For instance, renowned figures like Thomas Edison, who famously stated, “Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration,” exemplify how relentless effort can lead to groundbreaking achievements. Edison's invention of the electric light bulb was a result of countless experiments and tireless work ethic.However, the role of luck in success cannot be dismissed outright. A person may toil diligently yet still find themselves at the mercy of circumstances beyond their control. For example, consider a gifted athlete who trains exceptionally hard. Despite their dedication, they might not make it to the Olympics if they are injured or if other competitors outshine them unexpectedly. Moreover, factors such as socio-economic background, connections, and timing often determine opportunities that are available to individuals, meaning that even the most hardworking might benefit from a favorable twist of fate.In conclusion, while hard work is a fundamental pillar of success, the importance of luck should not be overlooked. An individual's journey to achievement is often influenced by a multitude of factors, creating a rich tapestry of effort intertwined with fortunate circumstances. Embracing this complexity allows for a more comprehensive understanding of what it means to achieve success.
203;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;During these digital age, the online classes has become more interest and more common in the society. Almost every school develops their online class systems. One question I always thought about is whether online computer classes should replace classroom learning. Although, online classes have many advantages, for me, I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons.First, the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying. Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class. Consequently, the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate's ideas. Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends.Second, classroom learning provides other activities than studying. During student's free time, they have a number of activities that they can join, such as playing sports, going to lab, or going to library. These activities lead to more interact with their friends. Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities, furthermore, they have a chance to learn about their societies. While the online course keeps the children at their home only.Lastly, in school, there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice. The professor provides good answers to you. They do not mind helping you, and they never leave you alone when you got a problem. In contrast, in distance learning, these aspects of the professor had reduced their important. The professor has been assigned to teach only. Moreover, there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question.In conclusion, traditional learning still has many benefits to the students. But in the future, it seems that the distance learning become more popular and ordinary in schools.;In recent years, the advent of technology has dramatically transformed the educational landscape, prompting an ongoing debate about whether distance learning and online computer classes should replace traditional classroom learning. While both modalities have their merits, the shift toward online education appears to offer distinct advantages that could enhance learning experiences for many students.Firstly, distance learning provides unparalleled flexibility. Traditional classrooms operate within rigid scheduling constraints, often necessitating students to adhere to specific times and locations. Online courses, however, enable learners to access materials and complete assignments at their convenience. This adaptability is especially beneficial for non-traditional students—such as working professionals or those with family obligations—who might struggle to attend fixed classes. By allowing education to fit around individual schedules, distance learning fosters a more inclusive environment and opens opportunities for a broader range of participants.Moreover, online education can cater to diverse learning styles. Digital platforms often include multimedia resources—like videos, interactive quizzes, and discussion forums—that can enhance understanding and engagement. This variation allows students to tailor their learning according to their preferences, potentially leading to better retention and mastery of concepts. Furthermore, many online courses leverage adaptive learning technologies, which can analyze a student's progress and personalize the educational experience to meet their specific needs.However, it is crucial to acknowledge the importance of interpersonal interactions that characterize traditional classrooms. Face-to-face engagement fosters a sense of community and collaboration, essential for developing social skills and network connections. Thus, while online learning offers numerous benefits, it should complement—not completely replace—traditional education. In conclusion, distance learning and online classes present significant advantages, primarily in terms of flexibility and customizable learning experiences. As educational institutions navigate the integration of technology into curricula, a balanced approach that combines the strengths of both online and in-person learning could yield the most effective educational outcomes.
204;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;The issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes. This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide. Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic. An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students. However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.Firstly, a liberal policy is very feasible. Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy. Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend. So an optional attendance saves time and money.Secondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook. This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic. By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching. Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.In addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life. Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning. With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency. Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.Finally, psychology knows two types of motivation. There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset. And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people. Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being. However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims. By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves. These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.To conclude, it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students. I hold this belief due to the improvement of students' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards.;The debate over whether university students should be required to attend classes or have the option to choose whether to attend is a pertinent issue in today’s higher education landscape. While both viewpoints hold merit, I firmly support the perspective that attendance should be mandatory for students. Firstly, attending classes fosters a structured learning environment that enhances academic discipline. University life can often feel overwhelming, with a plethora of responsibilities competing for students' attention. By making class attendance compulsory, students are compelled to prioritize their education, thereby cultivating essential habits such as punctuality, organization, and responsibility. This structured framework is particularly beneficial for younger students or those who have recently transitioned from high school, where attendance was closely monitored.Secondly, attending classes promotes engagement and interaction with peers and professors. The classroom experience facilitates discussion, critical thinking, and collaborative learning, which are difficult to replicate through solitary study or online resources. Engaging with diverse viewpoints and asking questions in real time fosters a deeper understanding of the material, which is crucial for successfully mastering complex subjects. Furthermore, relationships built in the classroom can lead to networking opportunities and collaborations that enhance students’ educational experiences and future careers.Additionally, the skills developed in a classroom setting extend beyond academic knowledge. Interpersonal communication, teamwork, and public speaking are essential competencies in any professional environment. Mandatory attendance ensures that students actively participate in these essential learning experiences. In conclusion, while the option for flexibility in learning can be appealing, the benefits of mandatory class attendance—discipline, engagement, and skill development—far outweigh the drawbacks. By requiring students to attend classes, universities are preparing them not only for academic success but also for their future careers and personal growth.
205;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Place of living has the most significant affect on our lives and we have to choose it according to several factors. Some people prefer to live in tall buildings and crowded areas, whereas others prefer to live in a small and calm town. I would prefer to live in a small town and I think a small town has some advantages, such as good weather, a healthy life and better facilities.Firstly, the first advantage of living in a small town is a healthy life that we can obtain due to many items. One of the conditions that helps us to be healthy is good weather and less population that exist in a small town. Also, in a small town there are less crowded and less traffic. Living in a place with less pollution such as air pollution or sound pollution helps us to have a healthier life and one of the main consequences is less stress and more happiness. Moreover, in a small town foods and materials we need are healthier than in big cities and there are fresh foods and fruits. Regardless of some exceptions, it is obvious that living in small towns is healthier than in big cities.Secondly, another advantage of small towns is living costs. Living cost is one of the important concerns in every society and then, in a small town living cost is fewer than in big cities. Therefore, in a small town we can live in big houses with good landscapes, also because of less crowded spaces we have more facilities and more services. Transportation cost is less than in big cities and we have less traffic so that we can save time and money.In conclusion, I prefer to live in a small town and I think it has some advantages such as less stress, because of better weather conditions and also, better relationship within a town. In small town people know each other and have better deal together than big cities therefore on big cities people feel alone and depress more than small cities. However it is an obvious fact that people in small town have more happiness and friendship and less illness and stress.;When considering the choice between living in a small town or a big city, I find myself leaning towards the charm and tranquility of a small town. There are several compelling reasons that make small-town living attractive, including a strong sense of community, a slower pace of life, and a closer connection to nature.Firstly, small towns often foster a tight-knit community. Residents typically know their neighbors, which creates a nurturing environment where people look out for one another. This sense of belonging can significantly enhance one’s quality of life. In a small town, social gatherings, local events, and spontaneous interactions on the streets can cultivate friendships and support networks that might be harder to establish in the bustling anonymity of a big city.Moreover, the pace of life in a small town is generally more relaxed. Without the constant hustle and bustle of urban living, residents can enjoy a calmer lifestyle, which can lead to lower stress levels. This conducive environment allows individuals to appreciate the little things in life, such as leisurely walks in the park or enjoying more time with family and friends.Lastly, small towns often boast beautiful natural landscapes and outdoor recreational opportunities. Proximity to nature contributes to a healthier lifestyle, as residents can engage in activities like hiking, biking, or simply enjoying the beauty of their surroundings. The lack of pollution and noise common in larger cities also allows for a more peaceful living experience.In conclusion, while big cities certainly offer their own advantages, the appeal of living in a small town, characterized by a strong community, a slower pace of life, and a harmonious relationship with nature, aligns more closely with my values and preferences. I believe that small-town living provides the ideal environment for personal fulfillment and well-being.
206;In many countries, young people leave rural areas to study or work in cities. What do you think are reason of this? Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;These days, there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities. Personally, I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this.To begin with, the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas. Obviously, many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career. Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living. For example, if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time. However, this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences. There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities. As a result, cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation. Additionally, it might put strain on the environment. If there are more people in the cities, there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road, which causes air pollution.In conclusion, young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials. In my opinion, however, I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment.;"In recent years, the migration of young people from rural areas to urban centers for education and employment has become a significant trend across many countries. Several reasons contribute to this phenomenon, including the pursuit of better educational opportunities, the allure of higher income potential, and the promise of a more vibrant social life.One of the primary reasons for this migration is the availability of educational resources in cities. Urban areas often house reputed universities, diverse vocational institutions, and abundant extracurricular activities that can significantly enhance a young person's education. Rural schools, in contrast, frequently face limitations in terms of funding, resources, and advanced academic programs. This disparity pushes many young individuals to seek their futures in cities where they can access superior learning environments.Economic factors also play a crucial role. Cities typically offer a broader range of job opportunities with potentially higher salaries than rural locales, which can struggle with limited employment prospects. The appeal of financial independence and career advancement can be compelling motivators, especially for young people eager to establish themselves in the workforce.However, while the movement to urban centers offers significant advantages, it is accompanied by certain disadvantages. The depopulation of rural areas can lead to a decline in local economies, which exacerbates issues such as underemployment and reduced community services. Additionally, city life can present challenges, including a higher cost of living, overcrowding, and increased competition for jobs.In conclusion, the migration of young people from rural to urban areas is primarily driven by the search for better education and job opportunities. While this trend brings economic benefits and personal growth potential to individuals, it can deplete rural communities and create urban challenges. Balancing these dynamics is crucial; thus, while I believe the advantages may outweigh the disadvantages on an individual level, the broader implications for rural areas require careful consideration and strategic interventions to ensure both environments can thrive."
207;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement. High school students should take a course on basic economics;In today's community, economy becomes the order of the day. Getting to know the theory in this area seems really important for our students. Then, the earlier we jump into this area, the more skillful we will be. Thus, in my point of view, although it will take some time on it, high school students should take a course on basic economics. Let me explain it in detail.For the primary concern, it can provide students a sense of direction in academy. Basic economic class can help the students touch the surface of this field, let them to know what this subject mainly discuss. That will help the students cultivate their own interest and a sense of career orientation. Finally, students may study harder for their economic dreams. On the other hand, economy is always correlate with politics, students can study specialized knowledge along with some Politian status, which may open their vision toward the nation and don't get limited in the textbooks. Besides, there is also an intimate connection between economy and enterprises, students can also gain knowledge more practical and vivid.In addition, the basic economic course can also help with the students when they go to college. They may feel more readily to learn the knowledge in this field and save much time, with that they are able to study more efficiently and more deeply than other students. That as well would provide the students with more confidence and let them become more compatible.Considering all those factors above, I suggest the basic course of economic is necessary.;I strongly agree that high school students should take a course on basic economics. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected and complex, understanding economic principles is vital for young individuals to navigate their future both personally and professionally. First and foremost, basic economics equips students with essential life skills. Knowledge of supply and demand, budgeting, and financial literacy can empower them to make informed decisions about their spending and saving habits. In this consumer-driven society, where young people are often bombarded with advertisements encouraging impulsive purchases, having an understanding of economic principles can help them discern their needs from their wants. As they prepare for adulthood, this knowledge becomes indispensable, enabling them to manage their finances more effectively, plan for higher education, and understand the implications of debts or loans.Furthermore, economics provides a framework through which students can comprehend broader societal issues. Topics such as unemployment, inflation, and government policies directly impact their lives but often remain abstract without formal education. By learning how these factors interrelate, students can become more informed citizens, engage in meaningful discussions about policy, and participate in the democratic process with a more nuanced understanding of how economic decisions affect communities.Lastly, a course in basic economics can ignite an interest in the subject itself, potentially motivating students to pursue careers in fields like finance, business, or public policy. With a solid foundation in economics, students leave high school better prepared to contribute positively to the economy, whether as entrepreneurs, informed voters, or responsible consumers.In conclusion, incorporating basic economics into high school curricula is not just beneficial but essential. It fosters critical thinking, equips students with practical skills, and encourages an understanding of the economic forces that shape our world.
208;University education should be restricted to the very best academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;"The question of whether university education should be restricted to only the very best academic students or made accessible to a larger portion of young people is a contentious topic with arguments on both sides. While there are merits to both positions, I strongly believe that a more inclusive approach to higher education is beneficial for society as a whole.Restricting university access to top academic performers may seem logical; after all, these individuals typically demonstrate strong motivation, aptitude, and the ability to succeed in a rigorous academic environment. Proponents of this view argue that by focusing resources and opportunities on the brightest students, institutions can maintain high academic standards, ensuring that graduates are well-prepared for demanding professional environments. However, this perspective fails to account for the diverse talents and potential that lie outside traditional academic metrics.On the other side of the argument, a broader access to university education fosters a more equitable society. Many young people bring unique skills, life experiences, and perspectives that enrich the learning environment, even if they do not excel in traditional academic settings. By allowing a range of students to pursue higher education, society benefits from a more diverse workforce equipped with varied talents. Moreover, education is not solely about academic prowess; it is also about personal growth, critical thinking, and social development. Granting access to university education can transform the lives of individuals, providing them with the tools they need to contribute positively to their communities.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments for limiting university education to the top academic students, the societal benefits of inclusivity and diversity in education far outweigh these considerations. By opening doors to a wider range of young people, we foster a richer, more dynamic society that values each individual's potential."
209;Prevention is better than cure. Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;"The adage ""prevention is better than cure"" underscores a crucial principle in healthcare that advocates for a proactive approach to health management. I wholeheartedly agree that a substantial portion of a country's health budget should be redirected from treatment to health education and preventative measures. This shift in focus carries several implications for public health, economic efficiency, and overall quality of life.Firstly, investing in health education can significantly reduce the incidence of preventable diseases. By educating the public on healthy lifestyle choices, such as nutrition, exercise, and mental health awareness, individuals are more likely to adopt healthier behaviors that mitigate the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular issues, and obesity. For instance, campaigns promoting regular physical activity and balanced diets can lead to a healthier population, reducing the strain on healthcare systems caused by preventable illnesses.Secondly, preventative measures often prove to be more cost-effective than treatment. Health systems that prioritize prevention, such as immunization programs and screenings, can substantially decrease the long-term economic burden associated with treating advanced diseases. By catching health issues early, we can avoid costly hospitalizations and complex interventions, ultimately saving public funds that can be reinvested in further preventative initiatives.Moreover, a healthy population enhances productivity and fosters economic growth. When individuals are less burdened by illness, they can contribute more effectively to society, resulting in fewer sick days and greater workforce participation. This not only strengthens the economy but also improves overall community well-being.In conclusion, reallocating a significant portion of health budgets towards education and preventative measures is a responsible strategy that aligns with the principles of sustainability and proactive health management. By prioritizing prevention, countries can cultivate healthier societies, mitigate costs, and enhance the quality of life for their citizens, making this approach not just preferable, but essential."
210;With the pressures on todayÕs young people to succeed academically, some people believe that non-academic subjects at school (eg: physical education and cookery should be removed from the syllabus so that children can concentrate wholly on academic subjects. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Students have become more and more stressed during the last few years due to the increase in academic tasks assigned by their teachers to improve their academic success. While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that.To begin with, from the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects. If physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students’ health. For instance, after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes. Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people’s health, it will also decrease their learning capability.In addition, schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people. It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically. Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit. Thus, school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life.Some people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents. However, I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents. Moreover, parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills.In conclusion, I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student’s development. Therefore, schools should not remove these subjects.;The debate surrounding the removal of non-academic subjects from school curricula in favor of an exclusive focus on academic subjects has gained traction in recent years. While the pressures on young people to excel academically are undeniable, I strongly disagree with the idea that subjects such as physical education and cookery should be eliminated from educational programs.Firstly, integrating non-academic subjects into the curriculum plays a crucial role in the holistic development of children. Subjects like physical education promote physical fitness, teamwork, and mental well-being, which are essential for a balanced lifestyle. Regular physical activity is linked to improved concentration and cognitive function, which can positively influence academic performance. Hence, rather than detracting from academic success, physical education can enhance it by ensuring students maintain a healthy body and mind.Furthermore, practical subjects like cookery impart valuable life skills. In an era where health consciousness is crucial, teaching children how to prepare nutritious meals is fundamental. This knowledge fosters independence, enhances self-esteem, and encourages healthier eating habits, ultimately contributing to better academic and physical health outcomes. Cooking also encourages creativity and fosters problem-solving skills, which are transferable to academic disciplines.Moreover, the pressure to succeed academically can lead to burnout and mental health challenges among students. Non-academic subjects offer a much-needed respite from rigorous academic demands and help to reduce stress. They create a more balanced learning environment where students can express themselves in diverse ways, explore their interests, and develop social skills.In conclusion, while the emphasis on academic success is important, the removal of non-academic subjects from the school syllabus would be detrimental to students’ overall development. A balanced education that incorporates physical and practical subjects is essential for nurturing well-rounded individuals equipped to thrive in all aspects of life.
211;When people move to another country, some of them decide to follow the customs of the new country. Others prefer to keep their own customs. Compare these two choices. Which one do you prefer? Support your answer with specific details.;When people move to another country, most likely, they will face the choice between following the customs of the new country or keeping their original one. Some people choose the former one to assimilate themselves into the new culture, while some insist the latter one because the new customs are difficult to be accepted. As for me, I would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country.On one hand, it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs. When people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures. The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture. For example, if one wore in white and went to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra in Buddha's Birthday in India, he or she would learn something about Indian religion and culture. As a result, people understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country.On the other hand, keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination. When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country. The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society. One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969. They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it. While the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working. Although being much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination. Their houses and private cars were buried by local people, because the locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs. If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated.All in all, the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country, which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner, and assimilate to a new culture.;When individuals relocate to a new country, they are often faced with a choice between assimilating into the new culture or maintaining their original customs. Both options present their unique set of advantages and challenges, reflecting differing attitudes toward identity, belonging, and the integration process.Choosing to follow the customs of the new country can facilitate smoother social integration and foster a sense of belonging. Engaging with local traditions, language, and social practices can help immigrants build relationships with native-born citizens, making friends and enhancing communal ties. For instance, participating in local festivals or observing holidays can provide immigrants a deeper understanding of their new home and strengthen their community connections. Furthermore, adapting to the customs of the host country can also enhance employment opportunities, as employers often prefer candidates who display cultural awareness and can seamlessly fit into their corporate culture.On the other hand, maintaining one’s original customs offers a sense of identity and continuity, which can be crucial in navigating the challenges of relocation. Cultural traditions can provide comfort and stability in a foreign environment, helping immigrants retain a connection to their heritage. This choice fosters a rich cultural diversity within the host country, as varied customs can offer unique perspectives and practices that enhance the fabric of society. For example, immigrants who celebrate their native festivals contribute to multiculturalism, enriching the local culture and promoting tolerance and understanding among various communities.Personally, I prefer a balanced approach. Embracing aspects of the new culture while preserving the essence of my own creates a rich tapestry of experiences. This hybrid identity can enhance personal growth and encourage dialogue between cultures, promoting mutual respect. By navigating both worlds, individuals can celebrate their roots while adapting to their new surroundings, ultimately enriching both their lives and the communities they join.
212;Is it more important to be able to ework with a group of people on ta tem or to work independently? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, as the world is getting smaller, we need to be able to cooperate. Working in team is a necessary skill that every individual must master for success. Despite the importance of working in team, I still believe that the capability of working independly is more significant.Of course, effective cooperation can make things easier and faster, but in many important cases when team-working is not possible, the ability to work alone will help. The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working. Let's imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people, but you have no experience of working alone, standardized tests such as SAT, TOEFL may be your nightmares. Testing is a very important aspect of life, and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team. Therefore, if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college, acing your school's final tests, you should consider learning to work on your own.Moreover, the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people. Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas. Everybody in a team must have his/her own opinion first, then discuss them with other members. When we work in team, we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate. When everyone in a team can come up with his/her own ideas, working in team will definitely more effective.In conclusion, working with a group a people and working individually are all important. Both skills are necessary for a successful life. Nevertheless, the capablity of working alone is the foundation for the skill to work in team and plays a significant role in a lot of situations.;The ability to work effectively, whether in a group or independently, is a crucial skill in both academic and professional settings. However, when comparing the two, I believe that the capacity to collaborate within a team is generally more important. This assertion is rooted in the benefits of diverse perspectives, enhanced creativity, and the development of interpersonal skills.Firstly, working in a team allows individuals to tap into a variety of viewpoints and experiences. Each member brings their own unique knowledge and skills, which can lead to more innovative solutions to complex problems. For instance, in a group project for a marketing class, each student might contribute different insights based on their backgrounds and interests, resulting in a comprehensive campaign that no single individual could have devised alone. This amalgamation of ideas often leads to outcomes that surpass what any one person could achieve independently.Moreover, teamwork fosters a sense of community and encourages communication skills. In today's workforce, most projects require collaboration, making it imperative to develop the ability to work harmoniously with others. For example, in a corporate setting, employees must frequently engage in teamwork to align their efforts with corporate goals. The experience of collaborating with colleagues not only improves the quality of work but also builds trust and strengthens relationships that are essential for future endeavors.On the contrary, independent work does hold its merits, such as fostering personal accountability and allowing for personal creativity. However, as the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the ability to work well with others has become more valuable. Successful projects often rely on the synergy created through collaboration, which can lead to higher morale and a shared sense of achievement.In conclusion, while the ability to work independently is an important skill, the advantages of teamwork make it a critical competency in today’s environment. The capacity to collaborate effectively not only enhances creativity and problem-solving but also prepares individuals for success in an increasingly cooperative world.
213;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Smoking should not be promitted in restaurants and state laws that prohibit it should be upheld. Use examples and specific reasons to support your position.;Smoking brings a person great enjoyment and relief. However, one should not be encouraged to smoke as the cost of other people's health. In this case, I advocate the idea that smoking should be prohibited in restaurants as well as other public places, and that we should support states laws to ban it because smoking not only damages the restaurant's environment, but also imposes a potential threat on others' health.First of all, although it is too strong to assert that smoking should be prohibited everywhere in the society, one smoking in a restaurant is considered to enjoy his time with the ignorance of others' health. It is generally believed that, the second-hand smoke, which comes from the smoker's mouth, puts an even greater threat on surrounding people's health than the smoker himself. For example, if there is only one person smoking in a restaurant, all others will smoke unconsciously and their health is under attacked. This is because some burned substance in a cigarette can easily deteriorate a person's respiratory system after he/she inhales it. Therefore, smoking in restaurants should be strictly banned because it makes the restaurant a polluted place which threatens every customer's health.Furthermore, even though some customers do not worry about the threat that second-hand smoke imposes on them, the disgusting smoke will severely affect their appetite, or, in other words, spoil their meals and make them an unpleasant experience. The smoke exhaled from the smoker often makes other people feel uncomfortable or disgusted, thus affecting their mood in having their meals. This, on the other hand, can indirectly decrease the restaurants' popularity because fewer people are willing to consume there due to their unpleasant experiences. Lastly, smoking does no good to the smoker himself. Not only does it aggravate his health, making him more subject to respiratory diseases, but also it damages his public image and reputation. This is especially true when the smoker is a popular political figure or an entertainmening celebrity, because most people see smoking in restaurants as an impolite human behavior. At this point, the public are likely to believe that the smoker lacks basic civility and should not be encouraged to be a public leader. To conclude, smoking in a restaurant is a harmful and disrespectable behavior. It spoils the smoker's reputation and threats other people's health. Therefore, it is unwise to smoke in a restaurant as well as other public places, and relevant state laws should be codified to strictly prohibit it.;I strongly agree that smoking should not be permitted in restaurants and that state laws prohibiting it should be upheld. The effects of secondhand smoke on public health, the enhancement of overall dining experiences, and the economic benefits linked to smoke-free environments are compelling reasons to support this stance.Firstly, secondhand smoke poses significant health risks not just to smokers, but to nonsmokers as well. Numerous studies have shown that exposure to secondhand smoke can lead to severe health issues, including respiratory problems, heart disease, and even cancer. When individuals dine in a smoke-filled environment, they unwittingly inhale harmful toxins, which is a violation of their right to a healthy atmosphere. By prohibiting smoking in restaurants, we protect both patrons and staff from the detrimental health effects of secondhand smoke.Additionally, a smoke-free restaurant environment enhances the overall dining experience. Children and families, who may otherwise avoid dining out, can enjoy meals in a more pleasant and welcoming atmosphere. Without the lingering smell of smoke and the discomfort that comes with it, diners are more likely to savor their meals and linger longer, promoting a more social and enjoyable experience. This environment encourages more customers to frequent establishments, benefiting owners and staff alike.Finally, there are significant economic advantages to maintaining smoke-free laws in restaurants. Studies indicate that smoke-free regulations lead to increased patronage, as more people are inclined to dine in a smoke-free space. Restaurants can attract a larger customer base, which translates to higher revenues and job creation. In essence, smoke-free policies are not only beneficial for health but also for the thriving economic landscape of the food service industry.In conclusion, smoking should not be permitted in restaurants due to the health risks associated with secondhand smoke, the improvement of the dining experience, and the economic benefits that result from smoke-free environments. Upholding state laws that prohibit smoking in these establishments is essential for fostering a healthier, more enjoyable, and economically viable dining culture.
214;Do you agree that people should have hobbies and do physical activities that are very different from one's work?;"Whether or not people should have hobbies and do physical activities has been a controversial question. Different people have different ideas. Some people think we should focus on our jobs, but I don't agree with them. Having one's own hobbies and doing physical activities can bring us a lot of benefits.First, having hobbies and doing physical activities is the best way to keep fit. Looking at the computer screen all day long can make us daze, so doing some sport and hobbies can prevent us from becoming too fat or short-sighted. My neighbor Tom once was a computer engineer in a big company. He ate fast food everyday and never went out to exercise. When he found out that he was too fat to find a girlfriend, he made up his mind to loose weight. He started to jog every morning. After a moth, he is thinner and finds a girlfriend.Also, doing something for a long time can be boring, having hobbies and doing sports can refresh our mind. For example, at school, students have breaks every class so that they can relax for a few minutes and prepare for the next class. Humans are not robots; we can't keep working for twenty-four hours. Doing sports or hobbies for a short time can recharge our batteries.Last, we should develop at least one personal hobby, not to show off, but express our emotion when we feel depressed or pressured. Playing musical instrument is a good way, I can play classical guitar. When I meet difficulties in studies, I will take my guitar and play the song Green Sleeves. It makes me feel better and gives me the confidence.Although it may take us a lot of times to develop our personal hobbies, but doing so can bring us a healthy body, a refreshed mind and a way to release pressure and sadness. Hence, I think it is good for us to have hobbies and do physical activities which are different from our work.";Engaging in hobbies and physical activities distinct from one's work can be seen as a cornerstone for maintaining a balanced and fulfilling life. I firmly agree with the notion that such pursuits are essential for several compelling reasons.Firstly, hobbies and physical activities serve as a potent antidote to the stress and monotony that can often accompany a job. Work environments frequently come with high demands, deadlines, and pressures that, if unchecked, can lead to burnout. By participating in activities unrelated to one's professional life, individuals can create a mental and emotional buffer. For instance, someone who spends their day in a corporate office may find tremendous relief in painting or hiking, allowing for a refreshing change of scenery and mental stimulation. Engaging in these pursuits fosters creativity and broader perspectives, which can, intriguingly, enhance performance in one’s career.Moreover, hobbies often encourage personal growth and skill development. They allow individuals to explore interests that cultivate leadership, teamwork, and resilience, qualities that are transferable to the workplace. For example, participating in team sports can improve communication skills and the ability to work collaboratively, while creative hobbies like writing or music can enhance problem-solving capabilities.Additionally, physical activities play a crucial role in sustaining overall health. Regular exercise has been shown to improve mental health, boost mood, and increase energy levels, which can lead to greater productivity and satisfaction in one’s professional life. The endorphins released during physical activities can mitigate feelings of anxiety, combating the challenges of a demanding career.In conclusion, engaging in hobbies and physical activities markedly different from one’s profession not only enriches personal life but also contributes positively to work performance. Thus, cultivating interests outside of work appears to be a vital strategy for ensuring holistic well-being and professional fulfillment.
215;Should government spend more money on improving roads and highways, or should governments spend more money on improving public transportation (buses, trains, subways)? Why? Use specific reasons and details to develop your essay.;The population explosion results in the high demands of transportation. Many countries have suffered from pollution, noisy and casualty for a long time. From my perspective, the most possible solution to these problems is improving roads and highways because of three crucial reasons.First and foremost, we all know that upgrading public transportation will surely aggravate the pollution and accidents. The buses, cars and trains regularly emit a noxious gas which causes lots of fatal diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia. Moreover, the sound emanates from the engines can worsen our hearing. Most importantly, there are many accidents happening on the roads. For example, in my country, buses are attributed to the cause of skyrocketing of accidents. Each year, Vietnam has approximately twelve thousand people die of accidents which is equivalent to the death toll of the tsunami in Japan.Secondly, investing in roads and highways can broaden the area and allow more public transportation to work. Not only buses but also other personal vehicles can move easily on the roads. For instance, I always leave school at the time that everybody rushes into the roads and hastily goes home. It is extremely troublesome for me to escape from the crowd on the roads in only one hour. In contrast, if the roads are enlarged, everyone can go home in short time and there are hardly any collisions. Last but not least, spending on renovating the highways and roads can improve the quality. All of us are afraid of moving on the rough roads with lots of portholes. Those bad conditions result in many terrible accidents and make several people feel worried. We should not accuse the drivers of causing accidents because a part of the responsibility belongs to the authorities. What's more, a smooth surface makes the transportation and movement become safer and easier.In a nutshell, the advantages of upgrading the roads which I mentioned above are totally convincing and indispensable. I am usually inclined to this idea and I hope that the government will regard the investment in building roads as the most important thing.;The debate on whether governments should allocate more funds towards improving roads and highways or enhancing public transportation systems is a significant aspect of urban planning and infrastructure development. While both sectors are essential for a robust transit network, prioritizing public transportation offers numerous benefits that enhance urban living and address contemporary societal challenges.Firstly, investing in public transportation systems, such as buses, trains, and subways, can significantly reduce traffic congestion. As urban populations grow, roadways often become overcrowded, leading to longer travel times and increased pollution. Expanding and improving public transit networks encourages more people to leave their cars at home, thus alleviating traffic jams and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, improved public transport systems can provide a convenient option for those without access to private vehicles, thereby promoting inclusivity and mobility for all socio-economic groups.Secondly, the economic ramifications of investing in public transportation are profound. A well-designed transit system increases accessibility to jobs, which can lead to economic growth and lower unemployment rates within a community. Enhanced public transport also stimulates local businesses by increasing foot traffic in commercial areas and broadening the consumer base.Furthermore, public transportation is often more environmentally sustainable than road expansion. Highways require continuous maintenance and development, leading to habitat destruction and increased carbon footprints. Investing in public transport creates a greener alternative, which aligns with global initiatives aimed at fighting climate change.In conclusion, while improving roads and highways is undeniably important for accommodating vehicle traffic, prioritizing public transportation is a more strategic choice for fostering a sustainable, equitable, and economically vibrant society. By focusing on public transit, governments can address pressing urban issues, reduce environmental impact, and create a more accessible future for all citizens.
216;Some people believe that the best way of learning life is by listening to the advice of family and friends. Other people believe that the best way of learning about life is through personal experience. Compare the advantages of these two different ways of learning about life. Which do you think is preferable?;Life is full of challenges, difficulties and unexpected obstacles. Therefore, learning about life, which is useful for foreseeing problems and be assertive enough to overcome them are needed. Two main ways of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience. Both ways are good to follow because they all have their own distinct advantages.On one hand, the way of learning life through listening to the advice of family and friends is more realistic than the latter. Family members such as your parents are experienced in life so they can give you proper and sincere guidance on every aspect of life. And friends, people who are the same generation with you, they are understand your favorite and ability enough to tell you which is suitable for you, which is not. By listening to your family and friends advice, you can definitely avoid many unexpected things.On the other hand, finding out life through personal experience can help you become more independent and mature. For one thing, there are so many grate things that you can missed if you don't experience it by yourself. For example, a friend told you not to try skydiving because it was so dangerous. If you did as he told, you could fail to see how wonderful it is to be fall freely. In addition, family and friends accidentally harm you by giving you advice all the time. You will grow to be dependent and reliant. In contrast, free yourself and do what you desire without notice about consequences is the way that success people would like to choose.According to myself, both ways are good, but I prefer the latter. It is because growth is a long process that experience is indispensable. I believe that experiencing the real life by myself, I could learn more than just obey the advice. Parents and other predecessors used to experience their own life by themselves, why don't the younger try to do the same?In summary, each way learning life has its own benefits. But to me, learning about life through personal experience seems more appropriate.;The journey of learning about life is a multifaceted one, often navigated through the wisdom of others or the trials of personal experience. Both approaches offer unique advantages that shape an individual's understanding of life and inform future decisions.Listening to family and friends provides a rich tapestry of insights rooted in shared experiences and lessons learned. Those close to us often offer guidance based on their own life challenges, successes, and failures, serving as a vital source of support and wisdom. The advantages of this approach are twofold: it fosters a sense of community and belonging, while also potentially saving one from pitfalls that others have encountered. For instance, a friend’s advice on managing finances can prevent costly mistakes based on their own experiences, while familial lessons on relationships can help navigate social complexities more effectively.Conversely, personal experience cultivates resilience and fosters deeper understanding. The learning that arises from firsthand experiences is often more profound, as the emotions, challenges, and triumphs faced create lasting memories and personal growth. This approach allows individuals to develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as they navigate various life situations independently. Overcoming adversity or achieving success through one's own efforts can lead to a sense of empowerment and confidence that external advice may not provide.Ultimately, the most effective approach may not be a strict preference for one over the other, but rather a combination of both. While the insights of family and friends can illuminate the path ahead, personal experience enables individuals to traverse it with authenticity and self-awareness. I believe that learning about life is best achieved when one heeds the wisdom of others while also embracing their own unique journey. Balancing these methods not only broadens perspective but also enriches the understanding of what it means to lead a fulfilling life.
217;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.;Everyone has happy moments during their life. These happy moments are both in their childhood and their adulthood. In my opinion, childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.First, in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood. They do not have to worry about bills, jobs, how would their life be in the future. They just worry about two things: to have fun, learn and be happy. A child's daily life is school, playing and sleeping. For example, when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood. Moreover, I did not have to worry about costs and other things, I just had fun and learned. Also, people are most creative when they were children, children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy.Second, childhood is the period where people go to school and learn. Therefore, school memories are one of the best memories in a person's life. There you learn, to find your first love, to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun. For example, my father's best moments in his life are in his school years. Moreover, he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories.In other words, childhood is, indeed, the most happiest moments in a person's life. There is only one life and one childhood and people should live their childhood thoroughly.;"The assertion that childhood is the happiest time of a person's life is a subjective claim that resonates with many but can be challenged on various grounds. While there is merit in the belief that childhood is often characterized by joy and innocence, this perspective overlooks the complexities of individual experiences and the potential for happiness in later life stages.One of the primary reasons people consider childhood the happiest phase is the sense of freedom and imagination that typically accompanies this stage. Children are often unburdened by the responsibilities that come with adulthood, allowing for a carefree exploration of their surroundings. Their days are filled with play, discovery, and creativity, and the world appears unmistakably enchanting through their youthful gaze. The nurturing relationships they form with family and friends can also provide a sense of security and unconditional love, contributing to their overall happiness. However, this idealized version of childhood does not account for the challenges some children face. Issues such as bullying, family dysfunction, poverty, and mental health challenges can significantly dampen the joy of childhood. For many, these difficulties can overshadow the otherwise happy moments, leading to lasting effects that may accompany them into adulthood.Moreover, happiness does not cease in adulthood; rather, it transforms. Adults often find fulfillment through achievements, relationships, and personal growth. The joy of pursuing a career, building a family, or cultivating deep friendships can provide a sense of purpose that may surpass the simple pleasures of childhood.In conclusion, while childhood can be a joyful period marked by innocence and adventure, it is reductive to claim it as the happiest time of life for everyone. Happiness is a dynamic spectrum, continually evolving with our experiences, relationships, and personal development across all stages of life. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize that every phase of life has the potential to be filled with happiness, each in its unique way."
218;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;With technology advances, food has become easier to prepare in modern days. People now can use kitchen appliances such as microwave and toaster to cook their meals easier and more convenient than before. Also, instant food products take only a few minutes to be made into delicious meals. These changes make cooking so easy-to-use and time-saving as to improve the way we live to a great extent.First of all, people have more chance to do other activities they like since food preparation is no longer time-consuming. For instance, such a change has liberated many housewives from tedious cooking process and gave them additional time to do something more meaningful like accompanying family or doing a job. On the other hand, more people can sleep a bit later to go to work because they only need a couple of time to prepare for the breakfasts.At the second point, since food preparation has become easier and more convenient, it is certainly great to preserve diverse kinds of foods at home. People can have a variety of dishes even in a small meal and choose whatever they like. More men, on the other hand, are willing to participate in cooking that they had never done before. This transformation may bring positive impacts to family in some cases.In conclusion, the time-saving, simple food preparation process gives us more time to do other activities, more chance to select diverse kinds of foods and more willingness to cook meals. Of course, there may be some other perspectives that I neglected to fully consider. Nevertheless, for the reasons that I have presented above, I would assert that this change has improved our life significantly.;The advent of modern conveniences in food preparation has undeniably transformed the way we live, often for the better. As our daily lives grow increasingly hectic, the ease of preparing food can significantly alleviate stress, save time, and enhance our overall quality of life.To start with, the availability of processed foods and ready-to-cook meals has revolutionized the cooking landscape. For individuals leading busy lives, especially working parents and students, the ability to quickly whip up a meal helps to ensure that we can maintain a balanced diet despite our time constraints. For instance, pre-chopped vegetables and frozen meals can be prepared in just a few minutes, allowing people to spend less time in the kitchen and more time engaging in activities that enrich their lives, such as spending time with family, pursuing hobbies, or focusing on self-care.Moreover, advancements in technology have played a critical role in simplifying food preparation. The rise of appliances like air fryers, pressure cookers, and slow cookers offers efficient cooking methods, enabling individuals to enjoy nutritious meals without the burden of extensive preparation. For example, a slow cooker can transform tough cuts of meat and simple vegetables into healthy stews with just a few hours of unattended cooking. This not only nourishes but also fosters a sense of accomplishment and enjoyment in homemade meals.Additionally, the accessibility of online recipes and cooking tutorials has democratized culinary skills, making it easier for anyone to explore different cuisines and cooking techniques. This fosters creativity in meal planning and can become a relaxing and enjoyable pastime, ultimately leading to a healthier relationship with food.In conclusion, the ease of food preparation today has greatly improved the way people live. By facilitating quicker meal preparation, promoting efficiency through technology, and encouraging culinary exploration, these changes have allowed many to lead healthier, more balanced lives, enriching both their physical and emotional well-being.
219;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of these situations do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Learning to be independent is essential for young adults. However, how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue. In my point of view, staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult. My opinion is based on creating memories with parents, saving money, and taking advice from parents.First of all, one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents. The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age. When having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown. If he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together. All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by. Thus, I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile.Furthermore, living at home costs less than living outside. Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home. Therefore, he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents. Moreover, another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings. Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be. In a word, the parents can save money, if their children live with them longer.The third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother's suggestions. When in dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand. They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way. If the parents do not help him immediately, he would have to suffer more pain. Hence, taking advice from parents, the young adult can go through obstacles easily.To sum up, living with parents longer brings about memories with parents, less cost, and advice from parents. Hence, staying longer with parents is a better choice.;The transition from adolescence to adulthood is a significant phase in life that often sparks differing viewpoints regarding living arrangements. While some young adults aspire to gain independence from their parents as swiftly as possible, others prefer the comfort of family life. In my opinion, living independently earlier fosters personal growth, responsibility, and resilience, ultimately preparing young adults for future challenges.Firstly, independence encourages young adults to cultivate essential life skills. When they live on their own, they are compelled to handle daily tasks such as cooking, budgeting, and managing household responsibilities. For instance, a young adult who pays rent must learn to balance their finances, plan meals, and maintain their living space. These practical lessons build a sense of self-sufficiency that is crucial in adulthood. Moreover, the experience gained in managing a household prepares individuals for future challenges, whether in personal or professional spheres.Additionally, living independently allows young adults to explore their identity and make decisions that reflect their personal values. In an independent living situation, they have the opportunity to experiment with how they want to live, which can contribute to building confidence and self-discovery. For example, a young adult may find passion in pursuing a hobby or career without parental influence, gaining a clearer understanding of their desires and aspirations.On the other hand, living with parents can offer emotional support and stability, which can be beneficial in some circumstances, particularly during life transitions such as college or starting a new job. However, relying too much on parental guidance may impede personal growth and the development of crucial coping skills needed for adulthood.In conclusion, while there are merits to both living independently and remaining with parents, I believe that gaining independence at an early age offers young adults the best chance to develop vital life skills, foster self-discovery, and prepare for future responsibilities. Embracing this transition can ultimately lead to a more confident and accomplished adult life.
220;Do you agree or disagree with the statement that a zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and example to explain your answer.;Some people may believe that a zoo is futile in the era of globalization, which people can develop their knowledge fast and easily. However, I do not agree with them. I believe that the zoo is invaluable for human beings. It is very crucial for learning. It helps animals out of extinction. Also, it is a interesting travel location.First of all, the zoo gives humans new knowledge. When you were so young that you did not know many kinds of animals, what should you do if there were no zoo? Inevitably, the zoo is the important place for innate learning. The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically. They are able to observe animals' behaviors and features. Moreover, practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class. Besides, researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals.Secondly, the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats. In the zoo, there is not so harmful as a forest. They, fed by zookeepers, do not need to find food themselves. Furthermore, we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife.Last but not least, because of all weird, acute, and beautiful animals in the zoo, it can be a great tourist attraction. There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely. If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists, it will receive a great deal of money. That also make money flow, and then economics become better. It benefits to a certain country. In conclusion, the zoo not only saves animals in danger of extinction, but also helps people around the world have better lives. I firmly believe that the zoo is so useful for the earth.;The statement that a zoo has no useful purpose is a contentious one, and while some individuals may argue against the relevance of zoos in modern society, I firmly disagree. Zoos serve several valuable functions, ranging from education and conservation to scientific research and recreation, making them integral to society’s engagement with wildlife.Firstly, zoos play a crucial role in education. By providing an opportunity for people to observe and learn about animals up close, zoos foster a strong connection between the public and wildlife. Educational programs aimed at children and adults alike encourage awareness of ecological issues, the importance of biodiversity, and the need for conservation efforts. For instance, interactive exhibits and presentations allow visitors to learn about animals' natural habitats and behaviors, promoting empathy and a desire to protect these creatures in the wild.Moreover, zoos contribute significantly to conservation efforts. Many species are now endangered due to habitat destruction, poaching, and climate change. Zoos alleviate some of this pressure by engaging in breeding programs for threatened species, maintaining genetic diversity, and conducting research to improve animals' survival odds. Successful initiatives like the California condor recovery program illustrate how carefully managed breeding in captivity can facilitate the reintroduction of species into their natural environments.Lastly, zoos serve as valuable research centers for scientists and veterinarians. They provide an accessible environment for studying animal behavior, health, and reproductive biology. This research not only enhances our understanding of wildlife but also contributes to the development of better management practices for animals in both captivity and the wild.In conclusion, while the ethical considerations surrounding zoos must be acknowledged, they undeniably serve critical purposes in education, conservation, and research. Far from being obsolete, zoos are essential in promoting a deeper understanding of wildlife and supporting efforts to preserve our planet’s natural heritage.
221;Parents are the best teacher for young children. To what extend do you argee or disagree?;It is obvious that parents are the first teachers who teach babies how to walk and speak and make children to become a good person. Moreover, parents provide their children the best social skills and knowledge in order to prepare for their children's future life.First, children are taught basic things, which influence their whole life, by their parents. As a baby, they do not know any thing all around but they learn everything from their parents. Parents always try to explain and describe tenderly all things in simple way so that their baby can understand and learn from that. Consequently, parents bring the whole world of wonderful and colorful thing into their baby's little mind.Second, parents train their child how to become a good person. They always make their children basically say thanks and apology in the right way. On the one hand, it is common that they try to explain who is a good or bad person. On the other hand, children are shown how to behave well with others. This seems to be easy but this can influence positively their future children and makes children's behavior better before they face the real world.Third, it is clear that parents are ones who loves their children most and always take care of their children. Thus, they tend to provide the best knowledge and advice from their experience for children. Unlike a professional, parents always support children and give them much social skill so they can communicate well with others and have good habit in life. In fact, parents' support is one factor which makes people succeed in their life.In conclusion, parents are really the best teachers who give us much knowledge and advice. Based on love, they always try their best to make good condition for their children development in order to prepare children's future life.;The assertion that parents are the best teachers for young children is a compelling one, and I largely agree with this viewpoint. The role of parents in a child’s early education cannot be understated, as they lay the foundational stone for countless skills, values, and understanding that a child will build upon throughout their life.Firstly, parents provide the first form of education in a child's life. From the moment a child is born, they begin to learn through observation, imitation, and communication with their parents. The home environment is often where critical life skills are cultivated. For example, basic motor skills, language development, and social interactions are frequently nurtured by the parents through play, conversation, and daily routines. This early exposure is not just educational but also emotional, as parents offer the comfort and security that fosters a child’s willingness to explore and learn.Moreover, parents are uniquely positioned to instill values, ethics, and social norms. Unlike formal education settings, where the curriculum may not reflect every family’s beliefs or values, parents can teach their children what they believe to be right, important, and worthy of respect. This foundational understanding shapes a child's character and influences their actions and decisions throughout their lives.However, while it is true that parents are instrumental in their children's early education, it is important to acknowledge that they are not the sole educators. Professional teachers, caregivers, and the broader community also play crucial roles in enriching a child’s learning experience, often bringing specialized knowledge and perspectives that parents may not possess.In conclusion, I firmly believe that parents indeed serve as the most significant teachers for young children. Their influence during the formative years is profound and lasting, effectively equipping children with the skills and values needed to navigate life. However, this teaching should be viewed as complementing, rather than replacing, the contributions made by other educators and the community at large.
222;Some people say that television has a bad influence to young children. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, we have undergone many technology innovations such as Tv. Many people say that television has negative effects on children, since it can be violent or inappropriate for children. However, I strongly believe that television has more positive effects than negative effects. There are two reasons to support my idea.First of all, television has useful and educational programs. Not only the up-to-date news, but also there are many programs which has educational purposes. If children can use those programs wisely, they can learn many information from it. For example, in Korea, there's program called EBS. It is targeted for children to teenager. We can study subjects through EBS lecture. Also, there are many documentary films such as the life of a great man in Korea. Using those education programs let people get a lot of inspirations instead of having negative effects. In addition, Tv is helpful to relieve our stresses. There are many Tv programs such as sports programs. Many children have a lot of stresses recently, since they have so much pressure about study. When they are watching sports programs, it's easy to relieve those stresses. As an example, I got too much stress from the school. So, I was quite aggressive, however. After I watch the soccer match between Korea and Japan, the stress was gone. Instead, this soccer match helped me to continue my academic career in the school, since it helped me to relieve my stress.In conclusion, of course, the television can have violent programs, however, if children can use Tv programs wisely, there are more positive effects than negative effects. Now that, it has useful and educational programs and quite helpful to relieve stresses for children. For these reasons, I strongly disagree with the statement that television has negative effects on children.;"Television has been a prominent form of entertainment and information since its inception, yet its impact on young children remains a contentious issue. While some argue that television has a bad influence on children, I contend that it is not the medium itself that is detrimental, but rather the content and the way it is consumed.One of the primary concerns regarding television's influence on children is the exposure to inappropriate content. Many programs are rife with violence, inappropriate language, and negative stereotypes. Such content can distort young minds, leading to increased aggression, desensitization to violence, and unhealthy perceptions of social interactions. Additionally, excessive screen time can contribute to sedentary lifestyles, resulting in health issues such as obesity and related conditions. It is clear that, without proper guidelines and parental mediation, children's exposure to television can yield adverse effects.However, television also has the potential to be an educational tool that provides valuable information and promotes learning. Educational programs, documentaries, and even well-crafted children's shows can stimulate curiosity, enhance vocabulary, and introduce children to diverse cultures and ideas. For instance, programs like ""Sesame Street"" or ""Blue Planet"" not only entertain but also educate children about mathematics, language skills, and environmental awareness. Furthermore, the rise of streaming services has enabled parents to curate content more effectively, selecting shows that align with their values and educational goals.In conclusion, while television can indeed have a negative influence on children if consumed indiscriminately, it also possesses significant potential for positive impact when utilized thoughtfully. The key lies in parental guidance, content selection, and fostering an environment where children engage with educational and enriching programming. By taking an active role in children's media consumption, we can help them navigate the complexities of television in a manner that promotes healthy development."
223;Businesses should hire employees for their entire lives. Do you agree or disagree. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Ê;Many entrepreneurs hypothesize that it is safer to hire employees for their entire lives in order to ensure the productivity and efficiency of working. From my perspective, those assumptions are not only conservative but also out-of-date. I am biased towards the opposite side that businesses had better not employ the workers for the whole of their life because of the three main crucial reasons. First and foremost, various ideas and creativity from different people are indispensable for a company to flourish. The invaluable experience of senior employees can pass down to the young apprentices who get used to new job, but regularly give out creative and novel ideas. What's more, the rapid development in every field nowadays requires precise updates and access to new knowledge. Therefore, the youngsters are capable of meeting those standards. More importantly, they have activeness, inventiveness and enterprise which allow them to complete their jobs perfectly. These vital factors can decide whether the company can thrive or not.Secondly, the staff soon gets boring with their stable job in such a long time. At a certain time, they may presume that a securing job is the most important and necessary because they need to earn money to manage their life. Thereafter, the bulk of them realize that high promotion and competition can assist them to improve their skills and horizons also. Many people enjoy challenging them because they don not want to be monotonous and passive ones. The same-old-same-old environment soon makes them depressed, so this situation will have an adverse impact on the enterprise. Last but not least, the economic crisis and financial recession result in a tremendous increase in unemployment. In my opinion, the businesses ought to recruit many workers so as to tackle this aching issue. It enables the jobless to better their life and earn a living. Furthermore, the factories and companies will have abundant human sources to ensure the pace of manufacture and also devising lots of unique ideas. In a nutshell, varied characteristics of various people, feeling tired of having the same occupation and solving the unemployed problem drive me to agree with the statement that the employer should not hire the staff for a whole life. I believe that the brilliant bosses are conscious of the need for giving opportunities to diverse employees.;The notion that businesses should hire employees for their entire lives is a provocative idea that merits careful consideration. While the traditional concept of lifelong employment may evoke a sense of security and loyalty, I ultimately disagree with this perspective. Instead, I believe that a more flexible employment model better aligns with the dynamic nature of today's job market and the evolving needs of both employees and employers.Firstly, the rapid pace of technological advancement requires businesses to adapt swiftly to remain competitive. As industries evolve, so too do the skills required to succeed within them. Long-term employment can stifle this adaptability, as workers may become entrenched in their roles and reluctant to learn new skills. For instance, industries like information technology and renewable energy are constantly shifting, necessitating employees who are willing to learn and pivot. Hiring for life may hinder innovation and stifle the fresh ideas that new employees can bring, thus detracting from a company's long-term success.Secondly, employees often seek personal growth and career development. Many individuals experience shifts in interests or life circumstances that prompt them to seek new opportunities. A lifelong job may result in dissatisfaction if an employee feels unfulfilled or unchallenged. Furthermore, companies benefit from a diverse workforce that includes fresh perspectives, experiences, and ideas. Hiring employees on a shorter-term basis allows for a rotation of talent that can invigorate a company's culture and drive innovation.Lastly, the modern workforce often values work-life balance and flexibility. The rise of remote work and gig economies reflects a new reality in which employees prioritize autonomy over job security. Companies that embrace this trend can attract top talent who are increasingly looking for opportunities that align with their personal and professional goals.In conclusion, while the idea of lifelong employment may appear beneficial, the realities of a rapidly changing business environment suggest that a more flexible, adaptive approach to hiring is essential. Businesses should focus on fostering continuous learning and providing opportunities for growth, ultimately benefiting both employees and organizations.
224;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Childhood is the happiest time of a person's life. Use reasons and specific examples to support your opinion.;"I agree with the statement that childhood is the happiest period of one's life. It's not only the lack of responsibilities and daily struggle that make childhood the happiest time of our lives, but also factors like learning lots of new things every day and freedom to imagine and say what you think.Starting with our adulthood, we are strictly bounded with our responsibilities in our daily lives. We are told at what hour we shall wake up, how we shall dress up and how we shall behave. Every action we make are watched closely and judged by the community. But during our childhood, though responsibilies exist, we are much more free to do what we would like to. Being late for school or laughing at a place where you aren't supposed to do not have consequences as serious as that would be if you were an adult. Another great thing about being a child is possibility learning new and interesting things about the world you live in every single day. Being a child means that you are new in this world and every single thing around you is there to be discovered by you. There are lots of new facts you can learn, stories you can listen to and things you can see. Therefore, childhood is the period of time in which a person is surprised most.Using your imagination and saying what you think freely is another great thing about being a child. Children are not judged about the things they say as much as the adults, and freedom to express yourself is a very important for developing a colorful imagination. In adulthood, people are forced to express themselves in boundaries, therefore they are in no way free to think or use their imagination.Childhood, in several aspects, is the happiest period of our lives. It's not only because of the nature of childhood and children, but also the way our lives are changed when we are adults. In an ideal world with less boundaries, social judgement and more freedom of thought, things could be different; but since this is not the case, it seems that we will always be missing our childhood days.";Childhood is often lauded as the happiest time of a person's life, and I wholeheartedly agree with this statement. The innocence of youth, the freedom from responsibilities, and the unfiltered joy experienced during these formative years create an environment where happiness flourishes.Firstly, children possess a unique ability to find joy in the simplest of things. Whether it’s playing outside, discovering a new game, or even running through the rain, their exuberance is infectious. For instance, when I reflect on my childhood, I remember how a small trip to the park with friends could transform into an extraordinary adventure, filled with laughter and creativity. This capacity to derive happiness from daily experiences often diminishes with age, as adult responsibilities can overshadow such joyful moments.Secondly, childhood is typically characterized by a lack of serious responsibilities. Children are free from the pressures of work, bills, and complex social obligations that adults face on a daily basis. This freedom allows for exploration and self-discovery without the weight of adult expectations. I recall countless summer days spent exploring nearby forests, where the only concern was to return home in time for dinner. Such carefree moments foster a deep sense of happiness that is rarely replicated later in life.Moreover, childhood is a time when bonds with family and friends are often formed, creating lasting memories of love and connection. The support and affection received during these years provide a foundation for emotional well-being. Birthdays, holidays, and family gatherings during childhood are often filled with love and joy, reinforcing the notion that these early years are replete with happiness.In conclusion, while each stage of life brings its own joys and challenges, childhood undeniably holds a special place as the happiest time. The combination of innocence, freedom, and emotional connections during this period culminates in a reservoir of joy that is often unmatched in later years.
225;Learning about the past has no value on for those of us living the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Many people think that ""Past has nothing to do with present, as time never stops, the next generations are completely different from the predecessors"". Although it is true that life changes rapidly, there are many things in the past that we can learn about, such as mistakes, success and knowledge in many fields of study. First of all, the predecessors' mistakes are the first thing that we should consider when learning about the past. As everyone's life is too short to risk trying anything without any prepare, we all should learn about other's mistakes so that we can avoid making the same ones. Each mistake, from the smallest to the bigger one, is a treasure of experience, which, if we can make full use of, will make us well-prepared for many complicated situations of our life. Therefore, past obviously saves ourselves a bunch of failures and times.Secondly, people's success in the past is as significant as those mistakes. If the predecessors' mistakes are the indirect way that leads us to the goals, others' accomplishment can be served as the direct way. By looking into the ways other people use to achieve their targets, we have the chance to make those mine, put them into practice and, of course, be successful like them. For instance, Edison's statement ""Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration"" is still helpful for everyone today, and probably in the future. Last but not least, the past is the basis in which people can use to develope new knowledge, inventions. If it had not been for those knowledge in the past, we could never be as modern as today. How can America be the world's leading country if Columbus did not accidentally discover it in his search for India. How can the comtemporary scientists study the earth's gravity without the apple which fall on Newton's head. They are only some of many precious knowledge that the past presents us. We cannot ignore them in any way.All in all, the past's mistakes, success and knowledge all have crucial impact on people's lives today. We should make full use of the past, instead of ignoring it, for a better and brighter future.";The assertion that learning about the past has no value for those living in the present is a standpoint that overlooks the profound impact history has on our current lives and future decisions. I disagree with this notion for several compelling reasons.First, history provides invaluable lessons that can guide contemporary decision-making. Past mistakes, such as wars driven by nationalism or the economic collapse during the Great Depression, teach us about the consequences of our actions. By studying these events, societies can adopt policies aimed at preventing similar missteps. For instance, the aftermath of World War II influenced modern international relations, encouraging nations to prioritize diplomacy and multilateral agreements, ultimately leading to a decrease in conflicts.Furthermore, understanding history fosters a sense of identity and continuity. Our present is shaped by the legacies of those who came before us. Cultural traditions, social norms, and political systems evolve, reflecting historical influences. For example, the civil rights movements of the 20th century inform contemporary discussions about equity and justice, reminding us that the fight for human rights is an ongoing struggle that requires vigilance and engagement. Without knowledge of these historical contexts, individuals may lack a full understanding of their rights and responsibilities in society.Additionally, history instills critical thinking skills. Engaging with historical events requires analysis, evaluation of sources, and understanding multiple perspectives. These skills are vital in today’s world where misinformation can spread rapidly. By understanding how to assess historical narratives, individuals are better equipped to navigate complex current issues such as climate change, global pandemics, and social inequality.In conclusion, dismissing the value of learning about the past is a grave mistake. History guides our choices, shapes our identities, and enhances our critical thinking abilities. Embracing the lessons of the past enriches our understanding of the present and prepares us for a more informed and conscientious future.
226;Governments spent a lot of money for traveling outer space. Do you think the investment is reasonable? Give your own opinion and reasons to support you claim;Space exploration, for discovery of out of space, has been possible for human in the 20th century. The United state and Russia are the important countries that spend large budgets for the research of this subject. In my opinion, spending the budget for space exploration is an important activity to save living of humanity in the future. Many governments believe that space exploration is an activity that wastes the budget, while the essential challenge of humanity in the future would be the discovery of a new place for the living. In 20th century, although human being succeeded to achieve out of space by means of new technologies such as rockets, but finding a new place for living in another planet is impossible until now. In during history, our planet is threatening by many of other planets or stars and it is an enormous danger for living of humanity. Therefore, it is very significant to find a new place for living in other planets. Space exploration has used as a tools for military power in the cold war. In the future, many countries will try to prevent attach of other countries by using and invention new missiles. In the past, the space race happened between the United Stated and the Soviet Union. Both countries tried to send man to the moon and show their power to each other. As a result, space exploration will use as a military power for many countries.In summary, spending budget for space exploring is not the waste budget, because it may helps to save civilization of humanity. Although exploring space used for discovery of other planets, nowadays most of governments have used many rockets for military purposes and therefore the purposes of exploring space has altered.;The exploration of outer space has long captivated the imagination of humankind, spurring governments across the globe to invest significant resources into various space missions. While some critics argue that the funds allocated to space travel could be better spent addressing pressing issues on Earth, I believe that such investments are not only reasonable but also essential for the future of humanity.First and foremost, space exploration drives technological advancement. The challenges posed by space missions necessitate innovation, leading to the development of cutting-edge technologies that often find applications in everyday life. For instance, advancements in materials science, telecommunications, and even medical technology have been derived from research conducted for space travel. These innovations contribute to economic growth and improve the quality of life on Earth.Moreover, exploring space serves critical scientific purposes. Understanding phenomena such as climate change, planetary geology, and the potential for extraterrestrial life relies heavily on data collected from space missions. This knowledge is instrumental in addressing critical global challenges, including environmental sustainability and resource management. By investing in space travel, governments are also investing in our ability to understand, predict, and potentially mitigate the effects of global crises.Furthermore, the quest for extraterrestrial resources and habitats may become increasingly important as Earth's resources dwindle. Investing in space travel not only paves the way for potential colonization of other planets but also opens up opportunities for resource extraction, such as mining asteroids. This could alleviate some of the pressures faced by our planet's overburdened natural resources.In conclusion, while the costs associated with space exploration may seem substantial, the benefits derived in terms of technological advancement, scientific knowledge, and potential resources make it a reasonable and necessary investment. As we move forward, the exploration of outer space may well be one of the keys to securing a sustainable future for humanity.
227;Do you agree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.Ê;"Television is one of the greatest innovations that we use every day. Besides, watching television has some cons and at the same time has very good pros. However, while some people argue that TV has devastated communication among friends and families, I believe it has done the opposite. I think TV programs are among the popular topics in every day talk as well as a great time for gathering. In addition Modern TV has smart system that let you be connected with people.First, it's true watching TV take a lot of your day, nevertheless it makes people meet and start a conversation about what they watch at other times like weather forecast and sport programs.Second, people like having meals while they are watching TV. Families usually tend to watch television either with each other or friends. For example my friends and I used to sit together and enjoy watching movies using VHS player at nights. It was fun and a little bit similar to the cinema. Third, TV can be one of communication ways. Moreover, TV can be connected to multimedia devices that have smart operating system like Google TV, WDTV using Skype, tango and other apps. In addition Teenagers can play games online with their friends; therefore we can communicate with each other through TV. To sum up, TV may take some of your time away from your family and friends but it can also make family get together and help to get in conversation. As well as it's one way of recent communications, based on that I think TV helps you to get connected with people.";"The assertion that television has destroyed communication among friends and family forms a provocative basis for discussion. While it is undeniable that television has changed the way people interact, I do not fully agree with the statement. Rather than obliterating communication, television has, in many instances, transformed and sometimes enhanced it.Firstly, television has a unique ability to provide a common ground for conversation among family members and friends. For instance, a popular show can ignite discussions, debates, and shared experiences. Families who watch the same programming may find themselves bonding over favorite characters or plot twists, fostering connections that might not occur in absence of a shared interest. A quintessential example would be shows like “Game of Thrones” or “Stranger Things,” which have not only captivated audiences but also served as subjects of discussion amongst viewers, thus enriching relational dynamics.Moreover, the advent of streaming services has democratized access to global content, allowing families and friends to explore different cultures and ideas together. This exposure can lead to meaningful conversations about societal issues, human experiences, or moral dilemmas presented in these shows, deepening understanding and empathy among viewers. In this light, television acts not merely as a distraction but as a facilitator of dialogue and reflection.However, it must be acknowledged that excessive television consumption can lead to disengagement. When individuals become consumed by their screens, it can detract from face-to-face interactions. Striking a balance is key; moderation in screen time can allow for effective communication while still enjoying the benefits of television.In conclusion, while television poses challenges to communication patterns, it also presents opportunities for connection and dialogue. Rather than seeing it as a destruction of communication, it should be viewed as a complex influence on the ways friends and family engage with one another."
228;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship.Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There is an argument regrading weather letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking action that risks destroying a friendship. It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result. However, I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend, although mistake is terrible. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my opinion. First of all, a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever. Anybody does not remember mistakes. If someone remembers mistake, he or she has a closed mind. I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly. For example, my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift. However, I forgot about it just after two days, and I felt at peace with him. Some people might say I am silly, but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship. Second, Everybody makes mistake. However, if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake, there will be no friends around you. I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake, we will need to end a friendship. However, when the mistake friend made was not a big problem, we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life. According to a research, 85% of people answered that a best gift is a friend.I think that a mistake can not brake friendship if it is not a big because friendship is forever and gift our life.;In the complex landscape of friendships, the decision to allow a friend to make a mistake rather than intervening to prevent it can often be a matter of balancing emotional risks and personal growth. I firmly agree with the statement that letting a friend make a mistake is better than taking actions that could jeopardize the friendship.Firstly, allowing a friend to make mistakes fosters personal growth and learning. Everyone makes errors, and these experiences are often the most profound learning opportunities. For instance, a close friend of mine once decided to invest in a sketchy business venture. Although I could have intervened and warned him, I chose instead to let him figure it out himself. When the investment fell through, rather than losing our friendship, he gained crucial insights about financial decisions and a deeper understanding of the importance of research. By facing the consequences of his actions, he grew more cautious and informed in his future decisions.Secondly, intervening too forcefully can create resentment or discomfort in a friendship. Friendship thrives on mutual respect and understanding. If one friend feels controlled or judged, it can lead to tension and potentially damage the relationship. For example, another friend of mine faced criticism for her choice in a romantic relationship. Upon reflecting on her situation and facing the natural consequences, she eventually made the right decision about her partner, and our friendship remained amicable. Had I insisted she end the relationship, it could have cast a shadow over our interactions.In conclusion, while it is undoubtedly challenging to watch friends make mistakes, these experiences are indispensable for their development. By allowing our friends the space to err and learn, we reinforce their autonomy and strengthen our bonds, ultimately leading to deeper, more resilient friendships.
229;One of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;Nowadays, the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before, parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them, just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods. Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that, for example, asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves. In my views, I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons.First of all, when children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents. Thus, it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money. Take me as an example, when I was 16, I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own. At the beginning of the semester, I was told to buy a text book. Unfortunately, I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend. Therefore, I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money, and that did influence me in my life now.Secondly, by taking a part-time job, they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done. For instance, if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him. To compare with the school life, they might suffer only a small punishment at school. Under the circumstances, he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work.In conclusion, to help their children to adapt adult life, parents should let them experience it as much as they can. Due to the reasons given above, to encourage children taking a part-time job is a good choice for them to get prepared for adult life.;One of the most effective ways parents can assist their teenage children in preparing for adult life is by encouraging them to take a part-time job. Engaging in work during adolescence is not only a way for teenagers to earn their own money but also a crucial step in developing valuable life skills that will benefit them in the future.First and foremost, a part-time job instills a sense of responsibility. Juggling work alongside academic demands teaches teenagers how to manage their time effectively. They learn to balance their schedules, prioritize tasks, and meet deadlines—skills that are vital in adulthood. This experience can pave the way for better time management strategies when they enter university or the workforce full-time.Moreover, working part-time exposes teenagers to real-world environments where they can develop interpersonal skills. Interacting with coworkers, supervisors, and customers allows them to hone their communication skills and learn the importance of teamwork. These experiences not only enhance their ability to work collaboratively but also help them become more adaptable and resilient in facing challenges.Additionally, a part-time job encourages financial literacy among teenagers. Earning their own money provides them with firsthand experience in budgeting, saving, and spending wisely. They are more likely to grasp the value of money and understand financial responsibility if involved in earning it. These lessons are foundational when they eventually handle their own finances as adults.Finally, engaging in part-time work can also support teenagers' career exploration. Exposure to various job roles and industries can help them discover their passions and interests. This knowledge can guide future educational and career decisions, ensuring that they embark on paths that resonate with their aspirations.In conclusion, encouraging teenagers to take on part-time jobs equips them with essential life skills, promotes financial literacy, and aids in career development. By embracing this opportunity, parents can play a pivotal role in preparing their children for the complexities of adult life.
230;It is better for children to grow up in the countryside than in a big city. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to develop your essay.;It’s certainly better for children to grow up in a big city. Of course you need to choose a good neighborhood. I hold this belief because of two main reasons, academic and social reasons.Some people thinks that if a child grows up in a big city they will be all day at home at the computer or at the video-game, but this is not true if you live in a neighborhood with other people about your age as I did. My friends and I used to play soccer, bike, climb trees and do a lot of other stuff every day. We did play video-games, but that wasn't our main activity. In a big city there are more kinds of people and more things to do.I have a friend that grew up in the countryside. He said that he had to study a lot to pass the test to enter the university. This is another downside of growing up in the countryside. In a big city you have more qualified teachers and a better access to technology.Growing up in the countryside is not such a good experience, you won’t know a lot of people, there are gossips everywhere, and your life will be really limited. If someday I have children, I’m absolutely sure that they will grow up in a good neighborhood of a big city and they will be very happy about it.;Growing up in the countryside offers unique advantages that can positively influence a child's development, making it a preferable environment compared to the hustle and bustle of a big city. Although urban areas provide certain benefits, such as access to education and cultural exposure, the countryside promotes a series of holistic advantages that contribute to a child’s growth.Firstly, children in rural areas are often exposed to nature, allowing them to develop a deep appreciation for the environment. Outdoor activities such as hiking, farming, and exploring local wildlife foster creativity and curiosity. Studies have shown that children who spend time in natural settings exhibit better concentration and stress relief, essential for healthy emotional development. In contrast, urban children frequently face pollution and congestion, which can detract from their overall well-being.Moreover, the rural lifestyle tends to promote a strong sense of community. Children who grow up in the countryside often have close-knit relationships with their neighbors and families. This community-oriented environment instills values such as cooperation and empathy, crucial for social development. In big cities, children might feel isolated despite the proximity to many peers due to the fast-paced and competitive nature of urban life. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and anxiety, which are less prevalent in smaller, rural communities.Additionally, the countryside typically offers a safer environment for children. Lower crime rates and reduced traffic hazards play a significant role in allowing children the freedom to explore and engage in outdoor activities independently. This autonomy fosters confidence and self-reliance, traits that benefit children throughout their lives.In conclusion, while urban living has its merits, the countryside provides an ideal backdrop for children to grow up. The natural environment, close-knit communities, and overall safety contribute to healthier emotional, social, and physical development. For these reasons, I strongly believe that growing up in the countryside is more beneficial than in a bustling big city.
231;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I completely agree that parents are the best teacher. Children normally think that their parents are somehow special and that makes them the most important people in the children’s lives.Firstly, the things that parents say have great power to their child. More power than any friend or other adult could have. For example, if someone tells a kid that something is wrong and they shouldn't do it, but his father told him/her that it was right, the kid will listen to the father instead of the other person, even if his father is wrong.Secondly, a child normally spends more time with their parents than with other people, so their parents have more time to teach him/her than anybody else. They have more contact and more intimacy with their children. Lastly, children usually mirror themselves on their parents. That’s as important thing because even if the parents don’t intend to teach their children something, they are always observing and learning by themselves. So, if there is a man that beats his wife and treats her bad, his child probably is going to be rude and treat girls bad.All in all, I agree that parents are the greatest teachers and I think that they should be very careful with what they say and do in front of their child, because it can define who he is going to be.;The assertion that parents are the best teachers warrants careful consideration, as it encompasses a range of perspectives on education and learning. While I acknowledge that parents impart crucial life lessons and values, I ultimately disagree with the statement that they hold the title of the best teachers. This is due to the complexities of learning that extend beyond the familial setting.First and foremost, education extends far beyond the home environment. Professional educators are trained to deliver curriculum and employ diverse pedagogical techniques that cater to a wide variety of learning styles. For instance, a skilled teacher may utilize multimedia resources, group discussions, and hands-on activities to engage students in ways that a parent, lacking formal training, might not be able to replicate. Moreover, teachers provide access to a wealth of knowledge across numerous subjects, exposing students to concepts that may not inherently arise in a domestic context.Additionally, the social aspect of learning cannot be overlooked. Schools serve as microcosms of the larger world, where children learn crucial social skills, such as teamwork and empathy, through interaction with peers and authority figures outside of their family. A child who primarily learns from their parents may miss opportunities to develop these essential interpersonal skills, which are essential for success in both personal and professional realms.However, it is undeniable that parents play a pivotal role in shaping character and values. They are often the first educators, instilling fundamental morals and guiding their children through life's early challenges. For example, parents teach their children the importance of honesty and respect, foundations upon which further education can be built.In conclusion, while parents indeed teach invaluable life lessons, the role of formal education and the experience gained through diverse social interactions render professional teachers essential contributors to a child’s comprehensive development. The best education is a collaborative effort that integrates the wisdom of parents with the expertise of educators.
232;Nowadays, food has become easier to prepare. Has this change improved the way people live? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;The Technology has developed a lot. With that development, food can be prepared more easily and it can taste a lot better than it used to. With that change, people’s lives are a lot better for several reasons. Some good reasons are about having more time and being able to prepare better food without being a good cook.Firstly, people normally have lots of things to do. Because of that, they don’t have much time to spend in the kitchen. But being able to prepare a tasty food just putting it into the microwave or into the oven is awesome. For example, if an engineer needs to make a project, but he needs to deliver it tomorrow, he could save hours preparing a food with the microwave instead of cooking everything from scratch.Secondly, when someone wants to prepare a good food alone for some reason, some time ago he/she would need to be a very good cook to prepare that food, but nowadays is very easy to prepare a healthy and tasty food. For example, if a guy wants to prepare a dinner to his girlfriend, he could just buy some food that comes with instructions. Normally you just need to put it into the oven and wait some time.All in all, that ease to prepare food has improved people’s lives. And that happened mainly because of the development of the technology. But people should be careful with what they eat, because some industrial foods are very bad for their health, so they should buy only food from well known brands.;"The evolution of food preparation methods has significantly transformed daily life, making it easier and more convenient for many individuals. This change has ushered in a myriad of benefits that enhance not only the efficiency of meal preparation but also the overall quality of life for people across various demographics.First and foremost, the advent of technology in the kitchen has streamlined cooking processes. Gadgets like microwaves, food processors, and instant pots allow for quicker meal preparation, reducing the time spent on cooking. For instance, a busy working parent can now whip up a healthy dinner in under 30 minutes, compared to the hours it might have taken before the availability of these modern appliances. This efficiency not only aligns with the fast-paced lifestyle of contemporary society but also creates more opportunities for families to gather and enjoy meals together, fostering stronger relationships.In addition to convenience, easier food preparation has also contributed to better eating habits. With the rise of pre-prepared and portioned ingredients, individuals are more inclined to cook at home rather than resorting to fast food or takeout options. This shift promotes healthier eating choices, as home-cooked meals can be more nutritious and tailored to specific dietary needs. For example, someone managing their weight may opt to prepare meals using fresh vegetables and lean proteins instead of high-calorie takeout.Moreover, the cultural aspect of food preparation has not been diminished; instead, it has evolved. Online resources such as cooking blogs, YouTube channels, and meal prep apps have made culinary education more accessible than ever. Even those without prior cooking experience can learn to create diverse, flavorful dishes from around the world in their own kitchens.In conclusion, the advancements in food preparation have undeniably improved the way people live. By making cooking more accessible and encouraging healthier eating habits, these changes have positive implications for both individual well-being and social connections. Thus, the ease of preparing food today signifies a notable enhancement in modern lifestyles."
233;Students should be required to take regular standardized tests to prove that they are learning;The issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams. This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it. However, I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge.Firstly, standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students. For example some students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue. Therefore, exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students. In addition, many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them.Additionally, standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice. Since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, so they will never try to solve problems on their own. However, standardized tests offer them such chance. Thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides.Finally, I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students. In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively. I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don’t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them.Ultimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right. I belive this, due to the fact that these schools can qualitatively check if they are giving an appropriate education to their students.;"In contemporary education, the debate surrounding the necessity of regular standardized testing for students is both pervasive and pertinent. Proponents of standardized tests argue that such assessments are crucial indicators of whether students are truly grasping the material being taught. By implementing regular standardized tests, educational institutions can maintain a consistent measure of student learning and accountability.First and foremost, standardized testing provides a structured framework for evaluating student progress over time. These assessments are designed to benchmark knowledge across various subjects and grade levels, allowing educators to identify gaps in understanding, locate areas requiring additional focus, and track overall learning advancements. Furthermore, regular testing can instill a sense of discipline and commitment among students. It encourages them to engage consistently with the curriculum, improving study habits and learning strategies essential for lifelong educational success.Moreover, standardized tests serve as a tool for accountability not only for students but also for educators and school systems. By assessing the effectiveness of teaching methodologies and curricula, educational authorities can make informed decisions regarding resource allocation and necessary educational reforms. This accountability ensures that both students and teachers ultimately strive towards educational excellence.Critics of standardized testing often raise concerns about stress and its impact on student wellbeing; however, when implemented thoughtfully, these assessments can be structured to minimize anxiety. Incorporating practice tests, providing adequate preparation resources, and designing tests that reflect a diverse range of student abilities can lead to a more positive testing experience.In conclusion, requiring students to take regular standardized tests has the potential to enhance educational outcomes. By offering a standard for evaluating both student learning and teaching effectiveness, standardized tests can facilitate continuous growth in the educational landscape, catering to the overarching goal of academic mastery and success."
234;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars;"A famous proverb “Knowledge is power” has demonstrated the value of education. I believe that universities should provide free of cost education to the interested scholars because now-a-days universities with good name charge high fees and this leads one to think about affordability. I have observed that many of the interested scholars failed to get the admission in good universities because they have to think about work along with the studies, and this left them with only one choice, which is work.University is more likely to become a money making business, the issue of affordability has become crucial to the students. In today’s world education is getting expensive, and people are tending to apply for self-finance education in order to get the admission. Whereas, the scholars are facing a lot of difficulties apart from their high requirements of previous education, they has a lot to face the other difficulties and burden while getting admission such as accommodation, food, traveling, clothing, etc.Moreover, it is hard to get manage two things at a time for instance, working and studying is not an easy job for the scholars, they need to concentrate on their studies. MPhils and PhDs scholars are probably engage in the research work, which takes their full concentration and surveys. The idea of free of charge education inspires those scholars who really want to put their efforts and get a degree from best universities.Therefore, universities have to look over the issues face by most of the scholars; their message should be spread education, not making money, and motivate those scholars who want to get education. Their notion should be inspirational in such a way which makes our society educative and increase our literacy rate.";"The question of whether university education should be provided free of charge to all interested scholars is one that stirs significant debate. I firmly agree with the idea that higher education should be accessible without financial barriers, as this approach fosters equality, promotes personal and societal growth, and addresses the pressing skills gap in the workforce.To begin with, providing free university education inherently promotes equality. In many societies, financial constraints can deter capable students from pursuing higher education, resulting in a loss of diverse talent and potential. When education is affordable for everyone, students from varied socioeconomic backgrounds can access the same quality of education, contributing to a more equitable society. This egalitarian approach would enable individuals to realize their full potential based on merit rather than their financial circumstances.Moreover, free university education can significantly enhance personal and societal development. With the burden of tuition fees eliminated, students are more likely to pursue degrees that align with their interests and talents rather than simply those that offer immediate financial returns. This freedom encourages creativity and innovation, fostering a more educated populace equipped to navigate complex global challenges. Additionally, an educated workforce is essential for economic growth; countries with higher levels of education tend to experience increased productivity and innovation.Lastly, offering free university education addresses the skills gap that many industries face today. As technology evolves, there is a growing demand for professionals with advanced knowledge and skills. By removing financial barriers, we can encourage more students to enter fields critical for the future, such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). A well-educated workforce can drive economic advancement and ensure that communities can adapt to changing job markets.In conclusion, a university education should indeed be provided free of charge to all interested scholars. This policy would not only level the playing field for students from diverse backgrounds but also stimulate personal growth and economic development, making it a vital step toward a more equitable and prosperous society."
235;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?Ê;Although professors in a university are basically teachers who do the most important thing, teaching, we cannot ignore one more influential aspect that they are always busy with, doing research. In my opinion, a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following.A professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject. He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him/herself forward all the time. And then he or she can do better in teaching works. For instance, the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr. Yang who keeps in researching and reading. He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves. All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA, the excellent teacher.As for students, we can get what we want to know from textbooks, webs or teachers. But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted. If a professor doesn't get any researching works, he cannot give us the opportunity. In addition, a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time. He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions. That is good for both of the professor and students.Finally, all professors in the university are fortune of the society. They are the leaders almost in every fields of science, arts, culture and so on. Without their research, there will be no new technologies come out quickly. Without their research, there will be more artcrafts being ruined by nothing. Without their research, there will be less information of our ancestors to be known on the earth.In conclusion, a professor should do their research all the time during their careers as a teacher in university. And it's worth to spend more time on it than on teaching.;The role of university professors has long been a topic of debate, particularly regarding the balance between research and teaching. While both aspects are crucial for academic institutions, I believe that professors should prioritize educating students, although research remains an essential component of their professional duties.Education serves as the cornerstone of a university's mission—equipping students with knowledge and skills for their future careers. When professors dedicate ample time to teaching, they foster an engaging learning environment that promotes critical thinking and intellectual curiosity. Personalized attention in the classroom helps students grasp complex concepts more effectively, leading to a deeper understanding of their subjects. Furthermore, professors who invest in their students' education can inspire them, transforming lives beyond the confines of academic learning.On the other hand, research is undeniably important in academia. It drives innovation and enhances a university's reputation, often attracting funding and prestigious faculty to the institution. However, excessive focus on research can lead to a disconnect between professors and students. When professors are too preoccupied with their research projects, they may not be available to support and mentor their students as effectively. This imbalance can negatively impact students’ learning experiences, as they benefit immensely from interactions with faculty who are engaged in teaching.Ultimately, the ideal scenario lies in a harmonious balance between research and teaching. Professors should conduct research, but this should not come at the expense of their primary role as educators. By creating a curriculum that incorporates their research findings, professors can provide students with cutting-edge knowledge, making the learning experience both relevant and impactful. In conclusion, while research holds significance, the priority must always be on nurturing and educating students, as they are the future leaders and innovators of our society.
236;How do television or movies influence people's behavior? Use reasons and specific examples to explain your answer.;There is no doubt that television or movies influence people’s behavior and they influence us in both bad ways and good ways. But I think in general television and movies influence our behavior in bad ways more than in good ways. They make people to eat more rubbish food, spend less time with their friends and family, and be someone that are not themselves. There are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television. Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas. It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people’s health. Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods. In turn, people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases.Television and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends, especially children. They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies. When people are watching television or movies together, they also talk less to each other, compare to when playing social games, such as parlor games, together.Television and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements. These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images. When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements, they think that they are ugly. Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body. When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him, then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don’t prefer it.I think television and movies are entertaining but most of the time they influence people’s behavior in bad ways. If you want to stay healthy, be yourself and spend time with your family and friends, then you should spend less time watching these media.;Television and movies have a profound influence on people's behavior, shaping societal norms and individual actions in various ways. This influence can be understood through the lenses of imitation, desensitization, and shaping perceptions of reality.Firstly, many viewers tend to imitate the behaviors of characters they admire. This phenomenon is often referred to as social learning theory, where individuals learn behavior by observing others. For example, a study found that children who watch superheroes on television are more likely to exhibit pro-social behaviors, such as sharing or helping others. Conversely, violent movies can lead to an increase in aggressive behaviors among impressionable audiences. A notable case is the “copycat” effect observed after the release of films that glorify violence, where real-life violent acts mirror those depicted on screen.Secondly, repeated exposure to certain themes and scenarios can lead to desensitization. Over time, individuals may become less sensitive to violence or moral dilemmas portrayed in media. For instance, audiences of action movies may begin to view violence as a standard response to conflict, influencing their approach to real-life disputes. This desensitization can alter how people react to issues like crime, reducing empathy and increasing acceptance of violent solutions.Moreover, television and movies also shape our perceptions of reality. They often present exaggerated or skewed narratives that can distort viewers' understanding of societal norms. For instance, reality television shows frequently depict unrealistic lifestyles or relationships, leading audiences to adopt misguided ideals about wealth, beauty, and success. This can drive behaviors such as consumerism, where individuals feel pressured to emulate the extravagant lifestyles seen on screen.In conclusion, television and movies significantly influence behavior through imitation, desensitization, and shaping perceptions. As media continues to evolve, it is vital for viewers to critically assess the content they consume to mitigate potentially harmful effects on their behavior and societal norms.
237;Many people visit museums when they travel to new places. Why do you think people visit museums? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Many people like to visit museums when they travel to new places, other people don't like to visit museums. I personaly tend to visit museums when I'm in a new place because it's good for me know about the culture, tradition and history of other places.The first reason why people are willing to visit museums when they travel to a new territory is that museums provide a tremendous amount of information about different aspects of the history and culture of that place, as I said back. And also taking the chance for making friends. Visit museums can bring you the opportunity to establish relations and knowledge to participate in conversations. And that kind of knowledge speaks very highly of you.However, other people visit museums are the most boring expirience of a trip. My cousin Pedro literaly hates to visit museums but he really enjoyed his visit to the famous London - Madame Tussaud museum, it was kind of art entertainment but also that visit helped him to understand the artist works, and in addition he started to respect and admire other types of arts that offers in other museums.In coclusion, the museums are a visual source to know the history, tradition and culture of any place in the world. I think it's fun and educational.;When traveling to new places, many people make it a point to visit museums. This inclination stems from several compelling reasons, including the desire to learn about local culture and history, to experience art and creativity, and to engage with the community.Firstly, museums serve as a gateway to understanding the history and culture of a destination. They house artifacts and exhibits that tell the story of a place, its residents, and its evolution over time. For instance, visitors to the British Museum in London can explore ancient Egyptian mummies and Greek sculptures, providing insights into civilizations that shaped our world. By examining these historical pieces, travelers not only gain knowledge but also a deeper appreciation of the cultural context of their surroundings.Secondly, museums are repositories of art, offering a platform for creativity and expression. Art enthusiasts seek out galleries and museums to experience the works of renowned artists firsthand, which can be far more impactful than seeing images online or in books. The Louvre in Paris, for example, allows visitors to stand before masterpieces like the Mona Lisa or the Venus de Milo, providing a visceral connection to the art that transcends mere viewing. This engagement with art can inspire and provoke thought, enriching the travel experience.Lastly, visiting museums fosters a sense of community and connection with the local population. Many museums often host lectures, workshops, and events that invite interaction and dialogue. Engaging with locals in such settings can offer travelers unique perspectives and insights, enhancing their understanding of the culture. For example, community-focused museums in smaller towns might feature local artists or historians, allowing visitors to engage with the heart and soul of the community.In conclusion, museums are essential stops for travelers as they provide invaluable opportunities to learn about history, appreciate art, and connect with the local culture, making each visit a memorable part of the journey.
238;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: In a busy and crowded world, we should not expect people to be polite to others.;Once a celebrity said: A man's manner is a mirror that reflects his virtues. Recently, the social environment we lived with busy noises and crowded spaces in case that people pay less attentions on their behaviors and manners. They are being rude towards others. Due to this phenomenon, someone suggests that we should not expect people to be polite to other. Obviously, I do not agree with such kind of altitudes, the explanations I explored would be stated as following.First of all, a person with good manner will give others a fine personal impression. Through those impressions, a person was easily to get acquired with others and blended with the community that surrounded him as soon as possible. For example, I worked in a new company, if I am a guy with good manners and treating everyone well, my new colleagues will accept me, even then I will be approved by the employers. In opposite situation if I am being rude, I can not get along well with each other. Finally, I will be fired and have no other choice but lost my job.Secondly, people will get respect from politeness within each other. Politeness and tender words not only can help the speaker to earn a good reputation but also that encourage the listeners who were in need. A successful corporation must have a relationship with respect and pleasure. There are many more facts have improved that people with politeness are easily to be succeed, because from their behaviors, they made their partners or opponents to find their own individual dignity.Finally, the society needs a civilized environment and orders. And a degree of social civilization depend on its people's qualities. In order to create a better living environment for ourselves and our offsprings, our behaviors must be asked with politeness and good manners. Benefit from those effective measures, there may be an obvious effect on the reducing of criminal rate.All in all, I suppose that people should be polite to others in a such busy and crowded world.;"In a busy and crowded world, the pressure of daily life can often overshadow basic social courtesies, leading some to believe that we should not expect politeness from others. However, I strongly disagree with this assertion. Politeness is not merely a luxury; it is a fundamental aspect of human interaction that helps to maintain civility and foster positive relationships, even amidst the chaos of modern life.First and foremost, politeness serves as a social lubricant that eases communication. In trying circumstances, such as crowded public transportation or busy urban environments, a simple gesture of politeness—like saying ""please"" or ""thank you""—can significantly enhance the mood and create a more cooperative atmosphere. When people are polite, they acknowledge the shared humanity of those around them, allowing for a sense of community and belonging, which is crucial in today’s often impersonal world.Moreover, expecting politeness encourages a culture of respect and empathy. When individuals prioritize kindness, even in fleeting interactions, it creates a ripple effect that can inspire others to do the same. This is particularly important in busy settings where stress levels are high. By maintaining standards of politeness, we not only improve our personal interactions but also contribute to a more harmonious society.Lastly, it is essential to recognize that an expectation of politeness does not disregard the realities of modern life. People may be preoccupied or stressed, yet understanding this context should motivate us to act with even more sensitivity toward one another. Acknowledging human imperfections should not absolve us from striving for kindness.In conclusion, rather than relinquishing our expectation for politeness in an increasingly crowded world, we should hold steadfast to this ideal. It enhances our interactions, fosters respect, and ultimately contributes to a more compassionate society, one that functions seamlessly amid daily hustle and bustle."
239;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;There is a famous old saying that failure is the mother of success. For that reason, some people advocate that some difficulties people met at their early ages will become an invaluable fortune in their future lives. However, some people think it isn't supposed to be that case. From my point of view, I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path.To start with, hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as, a shining weather, a delicious breakfast and etc. People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end. As a result, experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time.What's more, people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles. Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties, they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens. Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way.So, to sum it up, both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people's life path will be a priceless treasure to them. Remember if you are afraid of encountering difficulties, then you will be in the troubles all the time.;I firmly agree with the statement that most experiences in our lives, which seem difficult at the time, turn into valuable lessons for the future. Life is replete with challenges that test our resilience, adaptability, and understanding. While these moments can be uncomfortable or even painful, they often serve as crucial turning points that facilitate personal growth and development.One compelling reason is that difficult experiences inherently provide opportunities for introspection and self-discovery. For instance, consider the experience of failing an exam. At the moment, this failure may feel devastating, leading to feelings of disappointment and self-doubt. However, upon reflection, such an experience could inspire the individual to reassess their study habits, seek help from peers or tutors, and ultimately develop a stronger grasp of the subject matter. This newfound approach not only improves academic performance but also fosters a growth mindset, enabling the individual to face future challenges with greater confidence.Moreover, overcoming adversity often cultivates resilience, an essential trait needed in both personal and professional spheres. For example, an individual who faces job loss may initially perceive it as a catastrophic setback. Yet, this experience may lead them to explore new career paths, acquire additional qualifications, or even start their own business. The challenges faced during unemployment can instill a stronger sense of determination and adaptability that proves invaluable in future endeavors.Lastly, many of life’s hardest moments enrich our empathy and understanding of others. When we face struggles, we become more attuned to the difficulties of those around us. As a result, we grow into more compassionate individuals, capable of offering support and guidance to others in need.In conclusion, challenging experiences, while often disheartening at the moment, ultimately become valuable life lessons. They cultivate self-awareness, resilience, and empathy, shaping us into stronger individuals ready to navigate the complexities of life.
240;Life in a city is much better than life in the countryside;As far as I am concerned, I agree with the statement that life in a city is much better than life in the countryside.Firstly, in the city there is much better education system. This means, that the schools and the universities have well equipped classes and the famous professors would like to work in such places.In addition, I believe that city provides more work opportunities than the countryside. There are not only more jobs, but they are also well-paid. Of course living in a city is more expensive, but incomes are higher too.Moreover, in the urban areas there are also more citizens what means, that the culture diversity is huge. Meeting and knowing new people's tradition is an unforgettable experience, which could influence on one's previous habits.Furthermore, the city has well-organised lines of transport. The buses and trains are more frequent than in the countryside, so the city provides better communication.However, in the countryside there are many places to rest, because of its location. Moreover, peaceful and close to the nature areas could help to avoid worries and sadness.Taking all into account, I think that living in the city is much better nowadays, because of the opportunities it gives. Today living in the rural places is in most causes connected with agrarian lifestyle, which for me is without perspective. If I could decide I would chose living in the city for sure.;Life in a city is often perceived to be much better than life in the countryside for several compelling reasons. First and foremost, cities serve as vibrant economic hubs that offer a plethora of job opportunities. Unlike rural areas, where employment options may be limited and often tied to agriculture or small businesses, urban centers boast diverse industries including technology, finance, healthcare, and entertainment. This economic dynamism attracts individuals seeking growth and career advancement, resulting in a more prosperous lifestyle.Moreover, cities are cultural melting pots that provide residents with access to a wide variety of entertainment, dining, and recreational activities. From theaters, museums, and concert venues to avant-garde restaurants and bustling nightlife, urban living presents an abundance of options that cater to diverse tastes and preferences. This cultural richness fosters a sense of community, as individuals with different backgrounds come together to share experiences and ideas, enriching the social fabric of urban life.In addition to economic and cultural advantages, cities typically offer better access to healthcare and education. Urban areas house renowned hospitals, specialist clinics, and a myriad of educational institutions, including colleges and universities. This ensures residents receive superior healthcare services and educational opportunities, which can be vital for personal and professional development.Furthermore, cities often boast more robust public infrastructure. Public transportation systems, such as buses and trains, provide an affordable and efficient means of commuting. This accessibility reduces the need for personal vehicles, ultimately minimizing traffic congestion and environmental impact—a stark contrast to the limited public transport and increased reliance on cars common in rural areas.While life in the countryside offers tranquility and natural beauty, the dynamic, diverse, and resource-rich environment of city life presents significant benefits that enhance personal and professional growth. For those seeking opportunities, cultural experiences, and convenience, urban living undoubtedly stands out as the preferable option.
241;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Your job has more effect on your happiness than your living environment does.;With the development of the economy, people become more and more rich. They start to pay attention to mental requirement like happiness. While I accept that job can offer happiness to some people, I believe that living environment is more important than job for most of us.Admittedly, job can bring us happiness. People can receive a sense of values and respected from job. If people receive respect from others, they will feel achievement and self-confidence. In addition, job can provide money to us. However, people should concern more about their living environment than job. First, for most of us, job is only a tool to maintain our lives. Few people can feel happiness from their job because they have to continue to work more than 30 years. For example, Workers in the FOXCONN factory, which is the main manufacture of APPLE Company, just repeat one action more than 8 hours every day. These labor works cannot provide workers with a lot of happiness because they feel tired and frustrated after long hour work. Second, beautiful environment is one of basic physiological needs, which are the most fundamental requirements for people. Without beautiful environment, people are not able to feel happiness and will fell anxiety. Nowadays, the fast development of economy is gradually destroying our environment very quickly. Factories released a huge amount of wasters into river and soil. In order to build city and factory, people destroy huge forests. In China, some residents who live in nearby some toxic factories became sick because these factories release a lot of toxic water and wasters into environment around people. Even though local residents benefits from an increasing number of jobs which are provided by those factories, they cannot feel happiness from high-paying job yet because most of them suffer from cancer or other diseases.In conclusion, it is far better to protect our living environment rather than focus on job or work since the goal people is for good livers.;"The interplay between one's job and living environment significantly influences overall happiness; however, I argue that a job has a more substantial impact on our well-being. Employment not only provides financial stability but also shapes our identity, social interactions, and personal fulfillment.First and foremost, our jobs are often a primary source of income, allowing us to afford necessary resources such as housing, food, and healthcare. Without financial security, even the most picturesque living environment can feel overwhelming and stressful. For instance, individuals with monotonous jobs in dreary locations have been known to find solace in their earnings, using them to create a comfortable home life. Conversely, a financially precarious living situation can overshadow any positive aspects one may have about their surroundings.Moreover, the nature of one's work plays a critical role in personal satisfaction. Engaging in meaningful work can evoke a sense of accomplishment and purpose. Individuals who find their careers meaningful often report higher levels of happiness, irrespective of their living environments. For example, healthcare professionals derive joy from helping others, which can mitigate any dissatisfaction they might feel about their physical surroundings. This sense of achievement and belonging often translates into a more optimistic outlook on life.In addition, the workplace is a hub for social interactions. Healthy relationships formed with colleagues can enhance happiness significantly. Supportive work environments foster collaboration and camaraderie, which can increase job satisfaction and emotional balance. On the other hand, an unfulfilling living environment may lack social engagement, leaving individuals feeling isolated despite their luxury.In conclusion, while both job and living environment influence happiness, a meaningful and fulfilling job ultimately wields greater power. It shapes our financial circumstances, provides a sense of purpose, and creates avenues for social connections, reinforcing the notion that our work is at the heart of our overall contentment."
242;Some people like to communicate by e-mail and voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer?;Technology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day. Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much. Voice mail, e-mail, telephone or just traditional way: face-to-face. However, I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating.Everyone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication. You can talk to others from thousands mile. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact. We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address. If the address is wrong, then you will know right away. Moreover, e-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click.In addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly. Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid. Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect. For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do. Therefore, e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out. She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed. I don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive.Last but not least, every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time. Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident. For example, when I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively. They may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say. Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation. E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive. On the whole, to compare to all ways of communication, I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use. Its convenience saves our time. Additionally, honesty is necessary for every conversation and also fluency can't be missing for a persuasive expression.;In today's digital age, communication has transformed significantly, offering various channels through which people can connect. While some individuals prefer e-mail and voice mail for their convenience and flexibility, others advocate for traditional methods such as telephone calls or face-to-face interactions. Personally, I favor face-to-face communication, as it allows for a deeper and more meaningful connection.Face-to-face communication has the advantage of non-verbal cues, which play a crucial role in conveying emotions and intentions. Body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice enrich interactions, conveying nuances that are often lost in written forms of communication like e-mails. These cues help clarify messages, reduce misunderstandings, and foster a more personal connection between individuals. For instance, during important discussions or negotiations, being able to read the other person's reactions can be pivotal for achieving an understanding or resolving conflicts effectively.Moreover, face-to-face interactions tend to build stronger relationships. When people meet in person, they create a sense of community and trust, which is especially vital in both personal and professional settings. Sharing experiences, laughter, or even challenges in real time can bolster bonds that virtual communications struggle to replicate. Additionally, face-to-face communication encourages active participation and engagement, leading to more dynamic discussions.On the other hand, while e-mails and voice messages provide convenience and allow for thoughtful reflection before responding, they often lack the immediacy and interpersonal connection that face-to-face meetings offer. The potential for misinterpretation increases, and the absence of physical presence can make it harder to establish rapport.In conclusion, while digital communication methods serve their purpose in our fast-paced world, I believe that face-to-face interactions provide unparalleled richness in human connection, enhancing understanding and building stronger relationships. Consequently, I prefer to communicate in person whenever possible.
243;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"There are many interesting programs on television which anyone can enjoy at little cost. Compared to other hobbies such as going to theater or going to sports stadium, it is a very cost-effective hobby that gives viewer quiet a few indirect experiences. However, from my point of view, television has more bad than good because it has made people not to have conversation each other.To begin with, television shows make people forget what is really important. One who has favorite programs tends to be obessed with them when they are on air. Thus, they cannot make appointment or go out with their family or friends at that time since they think the programs are so crucial to their lives. One of my friends, for example, once cancelled an appointment to play basketball with in order to watch the favorite television show ""Infinete Challenges"". This is not only about basketball, but also about our friendship, which depends on how often we meet and have a chance to talk to each other. That is, watching television alone at home, my friend lost the opportunity to increase cohesion between us.Moreover, even when people watch television together, there is no chance for them to have conversation in front of television. Watching television program together is not that different from watching same program alone. Thus, it is not good for them to watch television if they want to improve their sense of closeness. To illustrate my point, it is reported that most of people don't converse with their family when they are watching television together. It is natural they behave in that way because television shows don't require any participation.In conclusion, I firmly believe that it is detrimental to communication among members in group, family or friends or whatever, to sit in front of television and just stare forward. It is because television not only makes people be obsessed with it but also makes their mouth close.";Television has often been criticized for detracting from personal relationships, leading many to argue that it has destroyed communication among friends and family. However, I strongly disagree with this assertion. While it is undeniable that excessive television viewing can hinder face-to-face interactions, I believe that television, when consumed mindfully, can actually enhance communication and foster connections among loved ones.Firstly, television serves as a shared experience that can strengthen bonds between family members and friends. Watching a show or movie together often sparks discussions, promotes laughter, and creates shared memories. For instance, a family might gather to watch a popular series or a film that resonates with their interests. Such moments allow for interaction, debate on character decisions, and sharing of personal viewpoints, thus facilitating deeper conversations and connections rather than driving them apart.Secondly, television can educate and inform individuals on a variety of topics, enabling more well-rounded discussions. Educational programs, documentaries, and current affairs shows expose viewers to new ideas and perspectives. This can encourage families and friends to engage in meaningful conversations about societal issues, culture, and science, fostering a richer dialogue that enhances understanding and empathy among them.Moreover, television has evolved with technology, integrating social media platforms that facilitate interaction. Many viewers take to various platforms to discuss episodes in real-time, allowing friends to connect over shared interests even when they are not physically together. This interconnectedness can bridge distances and maintain relationships.In conclusion, while I acknowledge that excessive television consumption can lead to neglect of communication, I maintain that television has the potential to enhance interactions among friends and family. By viewing it as a catalyst for conversation and connection, rather than a barrier, we can appreciate its role in modern relationships.
244;Some people like to communicate by e-mail or voice mail. Other people like to communicate by telephone or face-to-face. Which type of communication do you prefer and why?;Although many people prefer communicating by telephone or face-to-face, personally I believe that communicating by e-mails or voice mails is better. There are several reasons to support this idea which I would like to mention in this essay.Firstly, communicating by e-mail is easy. Many people have problems with calling a person that they are not acquainted with. In this case it is not so difficult to write an e-mail or to leave a voice mail because even shy people feel themselves more confident.Secondly, you can write an e-mail at any time of the day. As for me, I work and study at the university and I don't have spare time during the day. I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems. I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail.Thirdly, when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself. For example, you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite. When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail.And finally, there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail. You should not worry about interrupting an important conversation or some other business.To sum up, I would like to say that for me both options of communicating are possible, but if this is an important and not urgent question I would prefer to answer it by means of internet or voice mail.;Communication is a fundamental aspect of human interaction, shaping relationships, collaboration, and understanding. In today's digital age, we are presented with a variety of methods to convey our thoughts and feelings, from emails and voicemails to telephone calls and face-to-face meetings. While each mode has its own advantages, I prefer face-to-face communication for several reasons.Firstly, face-to-face conversations allow for a deeper connection. Nonverbal cues—such as body language, facial expressions, and eye contact—play a critical role in how messages are interpreted. For example, a smile or a furrowed brow can convey emotions that are often lost in written communication like emails or voicemails. This rich tapestry of interactions fosters empathy and understanding, creating a more nuanced exchange that enhances the quality of the conversation.Secondly, face-to-face communication reduces the chances of misunderstandings. Written messages can sometimes lead to ambiguity or misinterpretation, especially without the tone and inflection that come naturally in spoken dialogue. By being able to immediately address questions or clarify statements during a live discussion, both parties can ensure that they are on the same page. This is particularly important in sensitive or complex discussions where clarity is paramount.Moreover, face-to-face interactions often foster collaboration and creativity. In professional settings, brainstorming sessions conducted in person can lead to a flow of ideas that might be stifled in more isolated communication modes. The physical presence of others can inspire dialogue that is spontaneous and dynamic, leading to innovative solutions that might not arise in a more structured digital exchange.In conclusion, while email and voice mail offer convenience and efficiency, I firmly believe that nothing can replicate the benefits of face-to-face communication. The ability to connect on an emotional level, ensure clarity, and promote collaborative problem-solving makes personal interaction the gold standard of communication.
245;"Do you agree or disagree with the following statement ""haste makes waste"" use specific reasons and examples.";This saying is stating that every fast and not well thought decision is a wasted one. In my opinion, this statement is completely true, for these few reasons:For one thing, making a quick decision means that it's not very thought out, and that it hasn't been checked from all its aspects. Consequently, making quick decisions leads to probable bad results. For example: if someone decided to quit his job without really thinking about the alternative, or a plan B, he could end up being unemployed, because of his speedy decision.In addition, making a rushed decision could also mean that the person is missing out on a potential opportunity. In another word, if this person had waited and thought his decision through he wouldn't have missed out on the job opening in the same firm, but at a different position. Hence, he wouldn't have been unemployed.Not to mention, that hasty decisions, not only goes to waste, but also, could affect the entire life of the person. To put it differently, is that after this person has quit his job and became unemployed, he can no longer pay his bills nor buy what he needs for his everyday needs, thus, his life had taken a turn to the worst.As can be seen from this, is that a hurried decision is almost never a good one. That's why one should always study his decision carefully and slowly, to ensure that the decision that the person is making is the best for him.;"The adage ""haste makes waste"" encapsulates a profound truth about the nature of decision-making and productivity. I wholeheartedly agree with this statement, as rushing through tasks often leads to mistakes, inefficiencies, and missed opportunities for improvement.First and foremost, when individuals hurry to complete their work, the quality of the output typically suffers. For example, a student under pressure to finish an assignment may overlook critical details, leading to errors that could have been easily avoided with a more measured approach. These mistakes not only result in lower grades but also require additional time to correct, ultimately negating any perceived time savings. Similarly, in professional settings, hasty decisions can lead to costly blunders. A marketing team rushing to launch a campaign without thorough research may create misaligned messaging, alienating their target audience and undermining the brand's credibility.Moreover, haste can lead to missed opportunities for learning and growth. When we rush, we often skip crucial steps in the problem-solving process, which can stifle creativity and limit innovative thinking. For instance, a software developer who hurries to release a product might ignore potential improvements or features that could enhance user experience, resulting in a mediocre product that fails to satisfy customer needs. Taking the time to deliberate and reflect can lead to a more thoughtful and effective outcome.Additionally, the psychological toll of haste should not be overlooked. Constantly operating under pressure can lead to stress and burnout, reducing overall productivity and motivation. People who take time to prioritize their tasks and manage their time effectively often find themselves more satisfied with both the process and the end product.In conclusion, the wisdom in the saying ""haste makes waste"" is clear. Rushing through tasks can lead to errors, hinder creativity, and contribute to stress. By allowing ourselves the time to think, reflect, and execute carefully, we can produce better-quality work and foster a more fulfilling and productive experience."
246;Some people think that the automobile has improved modern life. Others think that the automobile has caused serious problems. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays the automobile is one of the most significant forms of transportation in everyday life. Many people own cars and use them daily, which clearly shows how important they are. Generally speaking, I definitely agree with the statement that cars have improved modern life, for several reasons.Firstly, people are now able to overcome long distances in a short amount of time, which leads to numerous advantages. For example in relationships. Many people are now able to maintain relationships over great distances because they can visit each other regularly by using their vehicle. From my personal experience I recall that my car has always been a great help to see my childhood friends very often although I lived in another city. I was also able to establish a relationship with a man living 89 kilometers away. Thanks to my car we could see each other at the weekends and are still a happy couple today. Without my automobile we would probably not have been able to develop a relationship.In addition, cars increase the chance of employment because people are able to drive to work and can work further away from home. Furthermore, they are more flexible. My father for example has always been working all around Germany and because of that earned more money. He used his car to drive to the other end of the country, worked there during the week and came home for the weekend. If he had no car, he wouldn't be able to see his family at the weekends so for him his automobile is a great benefit - not only in financial but also in social terms.Finally, the automobile allows people to travel more often and thus get to know the world. If people do not own cars they are likely to stay in their hometown or village most of their life. They are mainly using public transport and are thus limited in accessing certain areas. There are still places in nearly every country in the world that cannot be reached by public transportation and can only be visited by car. As a result, people who own a vehicle have greater access to more places and will see more of the world.In conclusion, the above stated reasons clearly outweigh the fact that cars cause a lot of pollution because they provide flexibility, which is important in nearly all areas of life. Travelling, social life and employment are highly dependent on the flexibility of a person and there is nothing in the world that makes more flexible than an own car.;The automobile has undeniably transformed modern life, offering enhanced mobility and convenience. However, this advancement is accompanied by significant challenges that cannot be overlooked. In my opinion, while automobiles have improved aspects of our lives, the problems they have created warrant serious consideration.Firstly, the convenience afforded by automobiles has revolutionized how we travel and conduct daily activities. With the ability to drive from one location to another in a matter of minutes, individuals can access job opportunities, educational institutions, and recreational facilities that were once out of reach. This increased mobility fosters economic growth, as people can commute further distances for work, expanding labor markets and enhancing productivity.Nevertheless, the rise of automobiles is not without its drawbacks. The environmental impact is one of the most pressing issues. Cars are significant contributors to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating climate change and posing health risks to urban populations. Reports have shown that cities with heavy traffic often experience detrimental levels of air quality, leading to respiratory issues among residents.Furthermore, road safety remains a serious concern. The surge in automobile usage correlates with an increase in traffic accidents, which claim countless lives each year. Despite advancements in vehicle safety technology, human error, reckless driving, and distracted driving continue to pose significant risks on the roads.In conclusion, while automobiles have undeniably enhanced modern life by providing unprecedented mobility and economic opportunities, they have also introduced critical challenges, including environmental degradation and safety concerns. A balanced approach is necessary—fostering innovation in sustainable transportation methods, such as electric vehicles and public transit systems, can help mitigate these issues while retaining the benefits that automobiles bring to society.
247;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: It is better for children to choose jobs that are similar to their parents job than to choose jobs that are very different from their parents jobs.;When choosing a job, one need to consider it thoroughly. Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents' job or not, different people may hold different opinions. As far as I am concerned, I think choosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career. First of all, as parents are involved in the same environment, they could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information. For example, my father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge. Whenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting. Because he has many experiences, I could save enormous time in finding solution. This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues. If I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now.Nevertheless, since parents have worked in tens of years, they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry. They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children. For instance, they know which company has better welfare or provides better education. Moreover, their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies. It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society. When others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process. Some may argue that as time is different, the condition of job market is completely different. Therefore, choosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision. I agree with this opinion to some extent, but when it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly. The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash, so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more.In considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents', I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry. I believe parents can lead their children to a more smooth career path.;The topic of whether children should pursue careers similar to their parents' occupations or branch out into entirely different fields is a complex one. I contend that it is better for children to choose jobs that align with their parents’ professions, primarily due to the advantages of inherited skills, mentorship opportunities, and the reinforcement of family values.Firstly, children are often influenced by their parents, who serve both as role models and key figures in their understanding of work life. When children choose careers similar to their parents', they can capitalize on the skills and knowledge that have potentially been passed down through generations. For instance, if a parent is a doctor, the child may inherit a strong foundation in science and empathy through informal education gained at home. This existing familiarity can provide children a significant advantage as they pursue their own education and career paths.Additionally, selecting a career similar to their parents’ can offer unique mentorship opportunities. Parents, having navigated the challenges of their professions, can guide their children through the complexities of the job market, offer practical advice, and provide networking opportunities. This support is invaluable, especially in fields that may be difficult to enter without established connections.Moreover, choosing a profession similar to that of their parents can reinforce family values and work ethics. It creates a sense of continuity and belonging within the family structure, fostering pride in one's heritage. Many parents hope to see their children thrive and carry on their legacy, which can be intrinsically rewarding for both generations.In conclusion, while it is essential for children to explore their own interests and passions, there are significant benefits to pursuing careers similar to those of their parents. The transmission of knowledge, mentorship opportunities, and reinforcement of family values provide a strong foundation for children, potentially leading to fulfilling and successful careers. Thus, I agree that it is often better for children to follow in their parents’ professional footsteps.
248;Do you agree or disagree: To make children do well at school, parents should limit the time that children spend on watching TV and movies.;In 19th century, television is one of an significant inventions and has become a indispensible appliance in every house. For its accessible and containing fancy programs, television attracts audiences from a wide range of age and background. Children, who are addicted to TV, causes broad argument about whether they should be limited in watching television in amount of time. As far as I am concerned, I agree with that children should be forbidden in watching television or movies excessively.First of all, children generally have weak self-control, and thus they lose their time easily. Watching TV for a long time without doing homework is one of major headaches that most of children have brought to their parents. I, in my childhood, was just a typical case. Whenever I back to home from school, the first thing I would do is turning on the television and sit there for hours. I could watch TV for hours, but I could hardly sit in front of my desk to do homework for few minutes. I could memorize all channels that TV programs was playing, but I could barely memorize any word on the textbook. I, therefore, did extremely bad at school due to the lack of studying.Moreover, sometimes programs on TV are full of violence and sex which are harmful to children. Children are not mature enough to make a judgment of what is good or bad, therefore they are likely to imitate the behaviors on TV out of their curiosity. Recently, more and more children smoke because they imitate actors' behaviors on TV or movies. What's even worse, according to some statistics, there are more and more children have violent tendency, and the reports attribute this to TV programs and movies. It is obvious that there are many programs on TV or movies that are harmful to children in metal and physical health. How can anyone expect children could do well at school if they have those abnormal behaviors?Admittedly, in concerning the social relationship with peers, some may support that children should watch TV and movies for their rich contents that could give children some topics in conversation. I agree with this viewpoint to some extent. However, it doesn't mean that children should do it overtime and without being taken care what they are watching. In considering whether the time children watching on TV or movies should be constrained, I hold a strongly positive point of view toward this issue. Because children are poor at time management, and are less mature to make a good judgment, they cannot be too serious to be taken care when watching TV and movies.;The debate on whether parents should limit the time children spend watching TV and movies to ensure their academic success is complex and multifaceted. I firmly agree with this viewpoint, as extensive viewing of television and movies can detract from the time and energy children need to devote to their studies.First and foremost, excessive screen time often displaces time that could be spent on educational activities. When children spend several hours engrossed in shows or films, they may neglect homework, reading, or engaging in intellectually stimulating conversations with family. This can create a detrimental impact on their academic responsibilities, leading to poorer performance in school. Moreover, the content of many programs can also be disengaging or even counterproductive to learning stimulating skills and knowledge.Additionally, research has consistently shown that a sedentary lifestyle associated with prolonged screen time can adversely affect physical health. Poor health can lead to decreased concentration, fatigue, and a lack of motivation—factors that significantly hinder a child’s ability to study effectively. By encouraging children to engage in diverse activities outside of screen time, such as sports, reading, or creative hobbies, parents can foster a more balanced lifestyle that promotes both mental and physical well-being.Furthermore, the nature of television content often prioritizes entertainment over educational value. Many children are drawn to reality shows or cartoon series that do little to challenge their intellect or provoke critical thinking. In contrast, limiting time spent on these platforms can encourage a habit of seeking out more enriching forms of entertainment, such as documentaries, educational programs, or interactive learning games.In conclusion, I believe that by limiting screen time, parents can create an environment that promotes academic success. This moderation allows for a more well-rounded development in children, fostering both their educational accomplishments and their overall well-being.
249;Should we pay professional athletes (entertainers) a high salary? (Do professional athletes deserve their high salary?)Ê;Professional athletes and entertainers earn a huge amount of money that is hard to imagine. Most of the people spending their whole life can never achieve this. This salary gap between those famous people and us leads to a question-do those professional athletes and entertainers deserve this money? From my prospect, I believe that they do deserve this high payment.First of all, a worker's salary can properly reflect his/her competence and value on his/her career. Therefore, those who are paid high salaries must exceed others and achieve something incredible in certain ways. They are not paid for no reason. As we are now live in a competent world, we must show ourselves to be great enough so as to convince the employer that we deserve a better payment. It's all the same in every profession. That's why the richest athletes usually correspond to the greatest athletes in their fields, namely Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods.Second, such high salaries can also guarantee and support the athlete's great performances. Most of us only see the luxurious side of a rich athlete and ignore how may difficulties they've gone through and how much cost they've thrown into investing themselves. They shall reap within their high salaries. In other words, if they are not paid high enough in order to conform to their performances, there might not be such brilliant performances for us to be amazed. Some people might argue that the gap between the rich athletes and normal people is so huge that it seems to be unfair. However, in my opinion, as long as everyone has equal chances to pursue his/her dreams and careers, that would be fair. Fairness is not about equal payments for everyone, but equal chances to acquire the same goal or accomplishment.In conclusion, high salary for athletes is what they deserve in accordance with their own achievements and also a guarantee for quality performances. It is a positive encouragement for many more talented people to contribute to the world of athletics and entertainment, giving us awesome performances to enjoy.;The debate surrounding the high salaries of professional athletes has been a long-standing topic of discussion. Many argue that these entertainers are overpaid, while others contend that their salaries are justified given the unique demands of their careers. To understand this phenomenon, it is essential to analyze various aspects of the issue.One of the primary reasons athletes command such high salaries is the immense revenue they generate for teams, leagues, and related industries. Professional sports are a billion-dollar industry, drawing in millions of viewers, which translates into lucrative television contracts, merchandise sales, and sponsorship deals. In this context, paying athletes a significant portion of the generated revenue seems a natural outcome. Their performances attract fans and drive economic activity, thus justifying their financial compensation.Additionally, the career span of a professional athlete is often short-lived. Most athletes peak in their twenties or thirties, and injuries can abruptly cut careers short. As such, the high salaries can be viewed as compensatory, allowing them to secure their financial future within a limited timeframe. Consideration must also be given to the rigorous training, discipline, and physicality required to compete at such high levels. The commitment and sacrifices made by these individuals often remain underestimated.On the other hand, critics argue that the disproportionate salaries of athletes overshadow the compensation of essential workers, such as teachers or healthcare professionals, who contribute significantly to society. This raises questions about societal values and the prioritization of entertainment over essential services.Ultimately, the question of whether professional athletes deserve their high salaries revolves around market dynamics, individual merit, and societal values. While the salaries may seem excessive, they reflect the economic forces at play in the entertainment industry. It's crucial to strike a balance, ensuring that while athletes are justly compensated for their contributions, society also recognizes and rewards the essential roles played by other professions.
250;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People who canÕt accept othersÕ criticism canÕt succeed in group working.Ê;"In everyday life we encounter different people, and we receive different opinions about us or our works, no matter positive or negative. It might be easy to take praises but hard to accept criticism. Therefore, here goes the point that people who can't accept others' criticism can't succeed in group working. Personally, I agree with this statement.First, the core of group working is ""consensus"". It's the idea that everyone’s opinion accounts. In group works, group members gather together to have brain-storming discussion, think over every possible solutions and then finally reach an agreement. In this long process of discussion, there must be different opinions sparkling out. It doesn't work if one member solely insists on his/her idea and doesn't take other member's criticism because the work belongs to every member, not a personal show for specific one member. It's every member's duty to respect other's opinion.Second, taking criticism is a virtue as you take someone's opinion that is against you. Even if you are not working in a group, you still need to take others' criticism. Criticism definitely hurts because it points out your drawbacks and forces you to confront them. However, criticism can help you detect those drawbacks and fix them if you are willing to take it. Those who don't even take a word of criticism will eventually lose chances to get improved. In other words, if you can't take any criticism, not only will you fail in cooperating with other people, but also get defeated in personal works. As one Chinese idiom goes: ""The good medicine tastes bitter“. Criticism might be the most powerful solution to heal.However, some people might ask: what if the criticism proves to be wrong? What if that I was at first right but the seemingly reasonable criticism led me to the wrong direction? Doesn't insistence also a good character? In my point of view, even if you are right, criticism is still helpful because in this case it not only is a fixer, but it also serves as a practice to test you how much you know about your work. Taking criticism doesn't necessary mean that you have to take it all. You should have your own judgments too! And it's kind of art to make the best use of criticism.In conclusion, criticism is essential especially in group working but in other occasions we still need criticism. It's just like a picky mirror through which we can see the bad side of us and thus try to become more beautiful and confident.";"The ability to accept criticism is a cornerstone of effective collaboration and success in group work. I firmly agree with the statement that individuals who cannot accept feedback from others face significant challenges in achieving success within teams. Constructive criticism is not merely a reflection of an individual's shortcomings; rather, it serves as a tool for growth and improvement.Firstly, accepting criticism demonstrates emotional intelligence—a crucial trait for functioning in a group. Individuals who are open to feedback show that they value different perspectives and are willing to adjust their views or methods. This flexibility fosters a collaborative spirit, encouraging team members to share ideas without the fear of being met with defensiveness. Such a culture of openness not only enhances communication but also leads to more innovative solutions as diverse viewpoints are considered.Moreover, criticism provides essential insights into our blind spots. In a group setting, members may have unique roles and responsibilities, and it is highly likely that one individual’s perspective will be limited. Accepting feedback from colleagues allows individuals to view their work through a different lens, identify areas for improvement, and ultimately contribute more effectively to the team's objectives. Without this engagement, team members risk stagnation and discouragement, which can derail project progress.Lastly, the ability to handle criticism gracefully nurtures strong interpersonal relationships. When individuals react defensively or dismissively to constructive feedback, it can create tension, erode trust, and lead to conflicts. By contrast, those who embrace critique can foster a supportive environment where team members feel valued and motivated to contribute their best work.In conclusion, the capacity to accept criticism is integral to success in group work. It cultivates an environment of trust, encourages personal and professional growth, and enhances overall team performance. Thus, those who struggle with accepting feedback may find themselves on the outskirts of effective collaboration and ultimately hinder the potential for collective success."
251;Should we require our young children (aged 5-10) to learn music and art in addition to math, science, history and language?;Every parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful. In order to achieve this, they start cultivating their children when they are very young. In addition to basic knowledge like language or science, music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents. In my opinion, I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them. First, it's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young. Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination. Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules. They are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched. Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances. Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination.Second, music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing. They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way. They are essential to our spiritual life. Therefore, even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure.However, some people might argue that parents shouldn't put so much stress on children, since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them. In my opinion, it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like. If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much. In a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills. In this way, it will not be such pressure on children. In conclusion, young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage. Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his/her life.;"The debate over whether young children, aged 5 to 10, should learn music and art alongside traditional academic subjects such as math, science, history, and language is a nuanced one, yet it leans heavily in favor of including these creative disciplines in the curriculum. One of the most compelling arguments for incorporating music and art into early education is the profound impact these subjects have on overall cognitive development. Engaging in music and art stimulates different areas of the brain, fostering creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. For example, learning to play an instrument not only enhances fine motor skills but also improves mathematical abilities through understanding rhythm and patterns. Similarly, art encourages children to express their thoughts and feelings, cultivating emotional intelligence and boosting self-esteem.Furthermore, exposure to music and art can significantly enhance collaborative skills. Projects in these areas often require teamwork, helping children to develop communication skills and learn to appreciate diverse perspectives. In a world that is increasingly interconnected, these interpersonal skills are invaluable. Moreover, music and art enrich a child's cultural literacy and appreciation for diversity. Understanding various art forms and musical traditions fosters an inclusive worldview, helping children to empathize with others from different backgrounds. Such cultural awareness is particularly essential in our globalized society, where cross-cultural interactions are common.Lastly, the joy of creating and performing can lead to a lifelong passion for the arts, promoting mental well-being and resilience. In a time when mental health issues are on the rise among young people, the therapeutic benefits of music and art can serve as vital outlets for expression and stress relief.In conclusion, requiring young children to learn music and art alongside traditional subjects is not just beneficial; it is essential. By nurturing creativity and emotional intelligence, we equip the next generation with the tools they need to thrive both academically and socially."
252;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is explaining how that subject will help in their lives outside school.;There are many ways of teaching. Some people believe that strictly and carefully presenting theories in the class is the best way of teaching, while others assert that involving applications on that theory will be more convincing. In my opinion, I agree with the second idea that the best way for teachers to make students more interested in a subject is to explain how that subject can help and apply to their lives outside school.First of all, by explaining how the subject contributes to daily life, students will have vivid impression on that subject thus become more interested and active in acquiring the knowledge on that subject. Take chemistry for example, merely memorizing the names of the substances and the structural formulas seems to be very boring, while representing where and how those chemical reactions really happen near students will raise their curiosity and lead them to digest those theories learned from the class. While I was in senior high school, my chemical teacher once showed us how the detergent dissolves oil by an experiment and later on taught us how to describe this process with formal structural formulas. This type of learning method is more fun and eventually the results are good. I connected the visual images of that experiment with the formula and I barely forget, even though now I'm not studying chemistry anymore.Second, by bridging the theories with daily life events, students are given the chance to apply knowledge to their lives and develop their own ability of problem-solving. This will address students' interests because it's the assignment that needs real life participation. For example, in law class, students are informed their rights and duties and they are taught how they can apply law to different situations that might happen upon them. When any one of the situations occurs, they can think independently and figure out how to react.In conclusion, using life experiences and examples to demonstrate the knowledge on a subject is an effective way to attract students' attention and keep them eager on learning, not only because it reinforces students' impression on the knowledge but also invites students to practice the knowledge out on their own.;The assertion that the best way for teachers to engage students in a subject is by illustrating its relevance to their lives outside of school is compelling and merits agreement. When students can connect academic concepts to real-life applications, their motivation and interest in the subject tend to increase significantly.Firstly, when teachers demonstrate how a subject has practical implications beyond the classroom, it transforms abstract theories into tangible truths. For instance, when a math teacher explains that geometry is integral in fields like architecture, engineering, or even art, students are likely to develop a greater appreciation for the subject. Such connections can foster a curiosity about the world, motivating students to delve deeper into their studies. This approach not only enhances engagement but also promotes critical thinking as students begin to see problems and concepts as interconnected rather than isolated.Moreover, relevancy to real life can also cater to diverse learning styles. While some students may thrive on theoretical knowledge, others may find it easier to engage with hands-on projects that reflect real-world applications. For instance, a science teacher might encourage students to conduct experiments that replicate industrial processes or environmental testing, thereby illustrating the subject's significance.Additionally, students are more likely to remember concepts when they recognize their usefulness. This relevance-based learning can lead to deeper retention of knowledge and skills, as students feel a sense of ownership over their education—understanding why they learn what they do. In an era where rote memorization can become disengaging, contextualizing subjects can create a more dynamic and invested classroom environment.In conclusion, correlating curricular content with real-world applications not only ignites student interest but also prepares them for future challenges. By understanding the importance of their studies, students are likely to engage more deeply, fostering a love for learning that will benefit them both academically and personally.
253;Governments should focus its budget more on environmental protection than on economic developments.;Environmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century. They are both important because they are vital to human's future and welfare. However, since the budget and the recourse are limited, governments must choose between these two issues. In my opinion, I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments. The following are reasons why. First, environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments. All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one. Without Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she's gone. Just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well. Second, the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues. Environmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems. Take global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together. The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator, since the rising sea water could drown them. Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth.Some people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside. They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away. However, the truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now. It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages.In conclusion, environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence. As mentioned in the second paragraph, how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy? Similarly, how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by, ironically, by ourselves?;"The debate over the allocation of government budgets between environmental protection and economic development is increasingly relevant in today’s world. While economic growth is essential for a nation’s prosperity, prioritizing environmental protection is crucial for ensuring long-term sustainability and well-being. Governments should indeed focus more of their budgets on environmental initiatives than solely on economic development for several compelling reasons.Firstly, the health of the economy is intricately tied to the health of the environment. Natural resources such as clean air and water, fertile soil, and biodiversity are foundational for agriculture, tourism, and many industries. However, the rapid depletion and degradation of these resources due to pollution and climate change can lead to dire economic consequences. Investing in environmental protection helps safeguard these resources, ensuring that they can continue to support economic activities in the future. Secondly, climate change poses an existential threat that governments can no longer afford to ignore. The rising frequency and severity of natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, directly impact economic stability and infrastructure. Allocating a larger portion of the budget to environmental protection initiatives, such as the transition to renewable energy sources and sustainable practices, can mitigate these risks and foster resilience against climate-related impacts. Additionally, there is an increasing global acknowledgment that sustainable development can drive economic innovation. By investing in green technology and sustainable practices, governments can create new job opportunities, stimulate growth in emerging sectors, and attract foreign investment. This holistic approach not only addresses environmental challenges but also facilitates long-term economic benefits.In conclusion, while economic development remains a priority, it should not overshadow the urgent need for environmental protection. By reallocating budgetary resources towards sustainable initiatives, governments will not only preserve the planet for future generations but also foster a resilient economy that is well-equipped to face the challenges of the 21st century. The two goals are not mutually exclusive; rather, they should be integrated to ensure a sustainable future for all."
254;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not. Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen, the car use will decrease. While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. But as far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea, which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future. The following reasons will present my points.First of all, since the public transportation has improved, it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus. For example, I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars. So, with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own. Second, a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world. So, with the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not. For example, instead of driving each one's car, if we put forty people in a bus, it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city.Although, I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can't meet every place. Of course, it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places. However, no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet. It not only helps you to reduce the car use, but also good to your health. In this way, this won't be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared, the best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years.;"As we stand on the cusp of transformative technological advancements, I strongly agree with the assertion that in twenty years there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This shift is likely to stem from several interrelated factors: the rise of public transportation, urbanization, and advancements in alternative mobility solutions.Firstly, the trend towards enhancing public transportation systems is already underway in many metropolitan cities. As governments recognize the environmental impact of carbon emissions and traffic congestion, they are investing in robust public transport networks. Innovations such as electric buses and light rail systems not only alleviate traffic but also provide a more sustainable alternative for urban commuters. This will likely reduce reliance on personal vehicles, as people opt for efficient and eco-friendly transportation options.Secondly, urbanization is reshaping how we view mobility. More people are moving into cities, leading to increased density where the need for personal cars diminishes. City planners are rethinking spaces to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists over cars, promoting infrastructure that supports walking and biking. This cultural shift emphasizes convenience and sustainability, making it unnecessary for many residents to own a vehicle.Moreover, the rise of technological advancements such as autonomous vehicles and ride-sharing services further supports the decline of car ownership. Services like Uber and Lyft provide on-demand transportation, reducing the need for individuals to invest in and maintain a personal vehicle. As self-driving cars become more mainstream, the idea of ownership may shift to shared use, where individuals access vehicles as needed rather than owning them outright.In conclusion, multiple factors, including improvements to public transportation, urbanization, and innovations in mobility technologies, suggest that in the coming twenty years, car usage will likely decrease. The transition towards a more sustainable and efficient transportation system is not just inevitable; it is essential for a more sustainable future."
255;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? ItÕs not necessary for university students to attend class as long as they can pass their examinations.;In university education, students are given much independence in the ways of learning. Some students still rely on classes to keep up with the courses, while some students don't feel the need to attend classes because they believe that they can handle the exams. These different ideas of learning methods lead to a question whether it is necessary for university students to attend the class as long as they can pass their examinations. In my opinion, I believe that students should always attend class no matter what the outcome of the exam is. First, in terms of learning, attending class is more effective than simply studying alone to pass the exams. Classes are designed diligently for the students and professors absolutely bear more knowledge than the students. Professors not only have the knowledge, but also equip with experiences, knowing how to guide their students toward their academic achievements. Second, it's students' basic responsibility to attend class. Attending class is the most persuasive way for the students to show respect to the professor as well as themselves. Many professors grade their students with class attendances. In other words, class attendances are regarded as critical as examination performances. Those who even achieve high scores on exams could fail if they didn't show up in the classes.Some people might argue that if students already understand the contents on the class enough to pass the exams or they can study the course on their own. Why wasting time going to classes? Doesn't self-study more efficient? However, in my opinion, this is a rather immodest way of thinking. I believe that professors can always give students more than students themselves could because of the experiences and their qualifications as professors. Besides, even if students believe that they are so brilliant to surpass their professors, they can still go to the classes to discuss with professors and classmates. In conclusion, students can learn more thoroughly as well as showing respect for professors and themselves through attending classes. It's an essential learning process. Passing the exams is not the terminal purpose of learning. The learning process itself, however, is the most important and powerful way of evaluating a student.;In recent years, the debate surrounding the necessity of class attendance for university students has gained significant traction. Some argue that as long as students can pass their examinations, attending classes is unnecessary. However, I strongly disagree with this statement for several reasons.First and foremost, classroom attendance fosters a deeper understanding of the subject matter. While examinations may test a student's ability to recall information or apply formulas, they often do not capture the nuanced discussions and interactive learning that occur within the classroom. Engaging with professors and peers helps to clarify complex concepts and encourages critical thinking, which are essential skills not easily developed through solitary study.Moreover, attending classes cultivates important life skills. University is not only about academic knowledge but also about personal and professional development. By participating in lectures and discussions, students learn valuable skills such as communication, teamwork, and time management. These skills are crucial for future success in the workplace, where collaboration and effective communication are paramount.Additionally, regular attendance promotes discipline and consistency. In a world where distractions abound, committing to a class schedule helps students develop a routine that can enhance their overall productivity and focus. It instills the importance of accountability and responsibility, qualities that are highly regarded in both academic and professional realms.Lastly, social interaction is an inherent benefit of attending classes. Building relationships with fellow students and faculty can lead to networking opportunities, collaborations, and friendships that extend beyond academia. These connections can be invaluable when seeking internships, jobs, or recommendations.In conclusion, while passing examinations is an important aspect of academic success, it should not be the sole focus of university education. Class attendance enriches the learning experience, fosters personal and professional growth, and cultivates vital skills, making it an essential component of university life.
256;"When people succeed, it is because of hard work. Luck has nothing to do with success."" Do you agree or disagree with the quotation above?";What do you think when you see a beautiful building? And also when you see an airport? Do you think they have built by chance? Of course don't. Also it is ridiculous if you think world wide webs such as Google, Yahoo etc. created by chance. Howbeit some people think that luck is cause of a lot of success, but to be frank I cannot agree with them. I would explore my primary reasons here. To begin with, famous people are usually diligent people not lucky people. Hard work make you a professional man/woman which are powerful in his or her job. I mean, when you work hard you decrease portion of chance in your success. For example in football game it is said that penalty-kick need good chance to be goal. Statically the chance of being goal is fifty-fifty. But I think Ronaldo make a goal from a penalty-kick with more possibility than me. It is not for which Ronaldo is more fortune than me. Definitely it is for which he have more practice and exercise than me. He do a lot of exercise in football field every day, so it is not for which he is luckier than me.Moreover, we cannot always lean on our luck to be successful. I don't want to disavow the role of luck in success, but as you know it hardly accompany us. So, for example you prepare for TOEFL or other multiple-choice test which has four option to choose in every question. You cannot prepare for it without any study and Rely on your luck, even if you be a very lucky. If you pick up any choice by chance you would fail the exam. Undoubtedly it is wise advice which you have hard study to success on exam.Finally, you have to work hard to learn and to get a lot of information before doing a project in good way. The most fortunate people in the word cannot manufacture an automobile or build a high tower just by her or his chance. These plans is done by someone who is mastered in his/her work. Undoubtedly such people do work hard and have great experiences because of their hard works.In the end, I think any great success need great work not great luck, even though luck is one factor in reaching goal but its impact is extraneous and we must not reckon on luck in our plans.;"The assertion that success is solely attributed to hard work while luck plays no role is a contentious one. I find myself in partial disagreement with this viewpoint. While hard work undeniably lays the foundation for achievement, the influence of luck often intermingles with the fruits of one's labor in ways that are complex and unavoidable.To begin with, hard work is essential for success. Diligence, perseverance, and consistent effort are vital components that propel individuals toward their goals. Many who have achieved great feats, such as successful entrepreneurs, athletes, or artists, often attribute their accomplishments to their unyielding commitment to their craft. This dedication not only sharpens skills but also fosters resilience in the face of challenges. The notion that ""hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard"" encapsulates the idea that effort can lead to extraordinary outcomes.However, ignoring the role of luck in the calculus of success would be an oversight. Luck can manifest in various forms—be it the right place at the right time, serendipitous encounters, or unanticipated circumstances that favor one person over another. For instance, a talented musician may practice tirelessly, but the opportunity to be discovered often hinges on chance encounters with influential figures in the industry. Additionally, external factors such as socioeconomic background and access to resources can either facilitate or hinder progress, illustrating how luck intertwines with hard work.In conclusion, while hard work is undoubtedly a cornerstone of success, luck also plays a significant role that cannot be dismissed. The interplay between effort and chance shapes our life paths, suggesting that success is often a combination of relentless dedication and the fortuitous opportunities we encounter. Embracing both aspects allows for a more nuanced understanding of achievement and reminds us that while we can control our efforts, we must also acknowledge the unpredictability of life's journey."
257;Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than a teacher. Others think that it is better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.;Different people prefer different styles of learning. I think both learning by myself and learning with a teacher could be helpful. Learning with a teacher can prevent one from being confused and increase the rate and speed of learning. Another important point is that for practical subjects you have to have a teacher. On the other hand, sometimes I would rather learning on my own.A good and experienced teacher can help me learn faster and easier. Sometimes when learning a course by myself which is hard and confusing to understand and has few sources available, I get discouraged after spending a lot of time. In this situation, I'll look for a teacher and request for help from him or her. And then he or she will teach me the course efficiently in a short time and therefore I will learn faster and better and won't get discouraged and confused.There are some practical subjects that you can only learn them with a teacher or an instructor. For example, if you want to learn driving a car or some jobs like medicine and engineering and some sports like skiing and swimming, you'll have to find a teacher. It's almost impossible and inefficient to learn those things on your own. By the way, if you are going to learn some things by yourself, you may learn and understand them incorrectly! For example, from my own experiences, after I had started learning playing the guitar without a teacher, I got used to wrong habits regarding strumming and tempo, but after finding and learning with a tutor and identifying and eliminating those incorrect habits, I was able to play properly.There are some things that I prefer to learn them without a teacher because I won't have to spend extra money for a teacher and my time will not be wasted either because of going to classes. In today's world there are many great and useful sources available like books, electronic books, the internet and TV and satellite. I can utilize them as tutorials for many things. For instance, I can learn English or other languages by a lot of helpful books and many online websites. In sum, sometimes it is good to learn with a teacher and sometimes on my own. In my view, both can help and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages.;The debate over whether individuals learn better independently or with the assistance of a teacher has been ongoing for years. While there are valid arguments on both sides, I firmly believe that having a teacher offers unique advantages that cannot be easily replicated through self-study.One of the primary benefits of having a teacher is the structured learning environment they provide. Teachers curate a curriculum tailored to the students’ needs, breaking down complex subjects into manageable segments. This systematic approach helps learners build a solid foundation, ensuring they grasp essential concepts before progressing. For instance, a mathematics teacher can provide scaffolding, presenting simpler problems that lead to more complex ones, which is often more challenging to achieve in self-directed learning.Moreover, teachers offer immediate feedback and personalized guidance. When learning on one’s own, it can be difficult to identify mistakes or misunderstandings without an external perspective. A teacher can provide insights that help students recognize their weaknesses and strengths, allowing them to focus on areas needing improvement. This direct interaction fosters a more effective learning process, which is particularly beneficial for subjects that require ongoing practice, such as writing or languages.Additionally, teachers can inspire and motivate students in ways that self-study may not. Their passion for the subject can ignite a similar enthusiasm in students, encouraging them to engage deeply with the material. Inspiring educators often share real-world applications of lessons, intertwining knowledge with life experiences, thereby enriching the learning journey.While independent learning fosters self-discipline and critical thinking skills, my preference leans toward having a teacher. The expert guidance, structured approach, and motivational support that a teacher provides create a more dynamic and fruitful learning experience. In today's complex educational landscape, the role of a teacher remains invaluable in shaping engaged and knowledgeable students.
258;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Working at home with a computer and a phone is better than working at a companyÕs office using the same equipment.;Due to the convenience of current technology, people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them. People are no longer restricted in the office. This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it's better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company's office. In my opinion, I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office.First of all, while working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly. They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together. Think about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he/she can assemble his/her colleges right away and discuss. It's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone. For another example, if one’s computer or Internet has any breakdown, he/she can call the MIS staff to fix.Second, working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works. For example, people are easily distracted while working at home. It's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away. In addition, while people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing. Moreover, people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss.In conclusion, working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency. It not only has the advantage of working with colleges but also it provides a real working atmosphere that can never be grasped if people choose to work at home.;The debate between working from home and working in an office has gained significant attention in recent years, especially with the rise of remote work technologies and the shifting landscape of professional environments. While both options have their merits, I contend that working at home with a computer and a phone offers distinct advantages that make it more favorable for many individuals.One of the foremost benefits of remote work is the flexibility it provides. Employees who work from home often enjoy the ability to set their schedules, allowing them to optimize their productivity during peak hours. This flexibility can lead to increased job satisfaction and a better work-life balance, as individuals can accommodate personal responsibilities more effectively. In contrast, working in a company’s office typically requires adherence to strict office hours, which can be inconvenient for those with varying commitments.Additionally, working from home can significantly reduce overhead costs. Employees save on commuting expenses and time, enabling them to invest those resources into other areas of their lives, such as family time or personal development. Employers, too, can benefit from reduced office space requirements, lowering costs associated with renting or maintaining a physical workspace. Moreover, remote work fosters a more inclusive environment. Individuals with disabilities or those who may face difficulties commuting can thrive in a home office setup, as it allows them to create a workspace that suits their specific needs.However, it is essential to consider the potential downsides of remote work, such as feelings of isolation and challenges in communication. These issues can be mitigated through the use of technology and regular team interactions. Overall, while there are merits to both working environments, the flexibility, cost savings, and inclusivity associated with remote work make it a more favorable option for many in today’s evolving work landscape.
259;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In order to succeed, you should be more like others than be different from everyone else.;Achieving success is everybody's goal for life and there are absolutely many different directions that can lead people to success. Some people choose to be normal to wait for chances, while some other people prefer to be different from everyone else. Which one is the promising way to succeed? In my opinion, I believe that once you are unique enough, you are already on the way to success.First, being positively different from everyone else usually means that you've achieved something that is superior than others. As living in a competent world, we are like playing a survival game. Only who has the sharpest weapon can survive. If you don't make yourself outstanding enough or you fail to distinguish yourself from others, you will be easily replaced and eliminated by someone who is better than you. Take myself for example, when I was in college, I was always chosen to be the presenter of group report because I was the only one in my group who could present the report thoroughly and fluently.Second, being unique can create your own value which can never be taken by others. In other words, once you are special and unique, pursuing success is a matter of actively creating the fashion rather than passively waiting for other people to recognize and appreciate you. Take the most popular and prestigious technology company- Apple- for example. The reason why it gains such a tremendous success is because it achieves some brilliant qualities that can never be caught up by other competitors. It has its operating systems that can run smoother than any other companies and its design always wins the popularity among consumers. It is the uniqueness of Apple design that creates its own value.In conclusion, being different and unique is the better way to achieve success. It not only shows your competence but also creates your own value, making you take the lead in your way towards success.;In a world that often emphasizes the value of conformity, the statement that one should be more like others than be different from everyone else raises important considerations regarding success. While there are merits to mimicking successful behaviors and adopting traits that are widely appreciated, I firmly disagree with the notion that one should prioritize similarity over individuality when pursuing success.First and foremost, history presents numerous examples of individuals who have achieved remarkable success by embracing their differences. Innovators like Steve Jobs and artists like Vincent van Gogh forged their paths by thinking outside the conventional norms of their respective fields. Their uniqueness allowed them to create groundbreaking technologies and compelling works of art that have left a lasting impact on society. Such figures demonstrate that distinguishing oneself can be a powerful catalyst for success.Moreover, embracing one's individuality fosters creativity and innovation. When individuals feel free to express their authentic selves, they often generate unique ideas and perspectives that challenge the status quo. Diverse viewpoints lead to collaborative problem-solving, which is essential in today’s interconnected and rapidly evolving world. In sectors like technology, science, and the arts, diverse teams have been shown to outperform their homogeneous counterparts due to the variety of ideas and innovations they bring to the table.Lastly, the pursuit of authenticity can lead to greater personal satisfaction and fulfillment. When individuals strive to conform to societal expectations, they may find themselves in careers or lifestyles that do not align with their true passions and values. This dissonance can ultimately hinder their ability to succeed, as genuine motivation is often born from pursuing one's unique interests and strengths.In conclusion, while it may be beneficial to adopt certain traits or practices from others, the pursuit of success should not come at the expense of one's individuality. Embracing differences not only fuels creativity and innovation but also leads to a fulfilling and authentic life. Ultimately, it is our differences that often propel us toward true success.
260;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: Younger school children (aged five to ten) should be required to study art and music in addition to math, language, science and history.Ê;Undoubtedly, math, language, science and history are all extremely important subjects in student's education since these subjects provide students the basic understanding of the world. Therefore, some people assert that there is no need to learn other subjects for younger students. Nevertheless, the art and music, from my point of view, are also essential for younger student's future life because those subjects help students learn this planet from another perspective and they can release people from the enormous pressure nowadays. In this case, I would definitely agree that the art and music should be required to study.First of all, art and music would broaden student's horizon and therefore make them thoughtful. It is well known that the art and music are not bound by country border, and they are something that is shared by the people from every parts of this world and is symbols of various cultures. Under this circumstance, learning art and music enables students to appreciate the fruits of eminent artists and musicians and to feel the fascination of different cultures. For instance, students are able to feel the greatest music masterpiece in Euopren as the symphony of destiny-Beethoven's most notable workpiece is played. In addition, studying art and music is also the appropriate outlets of stress and superb ways to relax. Obviously, with the improvement of life rhythm, people have currently suffered too much pressure from their studies or jobs, and these pressure are likely to destroy one person if he cannot find a way to emancipate himself. Art and music are, of course most accessible tools for modern people to liberate themselves from the extremely stressful life. When enjoying one piece of brilliant paintings, such as the Mona Lisa, people would put all their pressure down on the ground and just think about what the most proficient and mysterious smile in this world stands for. At this moment, they would totally involve in the ocean of art and their stressful nervous would be relieved. Apparently, this sense towards art is built on the initial study on the art.Admittedly, the study of art and music is supposed to rely on younger student's own interest. The education of art and music would not work if students resist it. Thus, the school should replace some basic science class with some art and music class in order to cultivate student's interest of art without adding extra study pressure.In a nutshell, in the modern society, since understanding of the lengthen and depth of the world is important and meanwhile people have burdened excessive pressure, younger students' art and music education should not take the second place.;"In today's rapidly evolving educational landscape, the debate surrounding the curriculum in early childhood education remains pertinent. I strongly agree that younger school children, specifically those aged five to ten, should be required to study art and music alongside traditional subjects like math, language, science, and history.First and foremost, engaging children in art and music fosters creativity, a vital skill in the modern world. Creativity is not confined to artistic endeavors; it extends into problem-solving and innovation in various fields. By exposing young minds to artistic expression, we encourage them to think outside the box and explore unconventional solutions. This is particularly important in an era where automation and technology dominate many professional landscapes.Moreover, art and music education significantly contributes to the emotional development of children. These subjects provide an outlet for self-expression, helping children articulate their feelings and experiences. Within a structured learning environment, art and music allow individuals to process emotions in constructive ways, promoting mental health and emotional intelligence. For children who may find traditional subjects challenging, creative activities can enhance their overall well-being and self-esteem.Additionally, integrating art and music into the curriculum can enhance cognitive abilities. Research indicates that exposure to the arts can improve memory, focus, and critical thinking skills. These facets are essential for academic success across all subjects. For example, learning to play a musical instrument requires discipline and concentration, which can translate into better performance in more traditional academic areas.In conclusion, requiring younger school children to study art and music in addition to core subjects is not only beneficial for their cognitive and emotional development, but it also prepares them to thrive in a multifaceted world. A well-rounded education that embraces creativity will produce individuals capable of exceptional innovation and collaboration in the future."
261;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The personal and work-related challenges that young people are facing are not different with their parents and grandparents faced when they were young.;While debating about generation issues, people always have different opinions. Some people believe that little things changed through generation, while others claim that generation differences are presented in every way. In my opinion, I believe that every prospective between generations alters and especially the challenges for this generation are significantly different from the last generation.First, under globalization and industrial integration, the work-related challenges for this generation are getting more complicated and challenging. The successful people are those who can quickly respond to this rapid-changing world. In the past, focusing on one skill was enough to deal with the problems because every industry was rather small in size and simple to manage. However, as those industries expand and become internationalized, people are required to equip with multiple skills to answer those challenges. For example, now there are more chances to do business with people around the world, so besides one's own profession, language ability is essential as well. For another example, financial crimes are rampant in the 21st century, thus surging up demands for those who excel at both laws and financial management. Second, this generation is encountering the self-recognition issue which could not be experienced by the previous generation. The past generation was given less freedom and was usually asked to follow the paths their parents had prepared for them. In contrast, young people in this generation are exposed to more creative ideas and rather think individually. They are eager for finding who they are and what they really want. It is fortunate that they can struggle with these sweet worries and these worries are indeed never easy for them. They have to make decisions between so many possibilities and they are responsible for taking the consequences. In conclusion, challenges for this generation are more complicated and diverse than the past generation, whether in career or in self-identification. It is hard to judge which generation's problems are more difficult but it is no doubt that until the next generation, there will be whole new challenges waiting for the next youngsters.;The challenges faced by young people today inherently differ from those experienced by previous generations. While it is true that every generation grapples with obstacles, the nature of these challenges has evolved significantly due to societal, technological, and economic changes. Firstly, the rapid advancement of technology plays a crucial role in shaping the dilemmas of today's youth. Modern young adults contend with issues stemming from digital interactions, social media pressures, and the persistent presence of information at their fingertips. Unlike their parents and grandparents, who primarily dealt with face-to-face communication and simpler technological contexts, today's youth navigate complex online identities and cyberbullying, making their social and emotional challenges markedly different.Moreover, the job market has undergone substantial transformations. Young people are burdened with student debt at unprecedented levels and face an increasingly competitive landscape that often prioritizes specific skills over traditional education paths. While earlier generations also faced employment challenges, the current economic climate highlights precarious job security, gig economies, and the necessity for continual skill development. The fears and stresses regarding careers and financial stability are therefore amplified today in ways that past generations may not have comprehensively understood.Additionally, contemporary issues, such as climate change and socio-political unrest, create a unique sense of urgency and anxiety for the under-30 demographic. Past generations engaged with their own challenges, like civil rights movements and world wars, but the scale and immediacy of global ecological threats represent a new level of complexity that affects young people's worldview and sense of agency.In conclusion, while it is undeniable that young people today and their predecessors encounter challenges, the specifics of these dilemmas are inherently different. The unique circumstances of the current global landscape necessitate a recognition of these disparities, emphasizing the need for tailored support and understanding for today's youth.
262;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Views differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is better than specializing in one specific subject. Some people believe that having a broad knowledge can give you a higher chance to success, while others think that professional in a specific subject is the key to enroll a success. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. As far as I am concerned, having a large scale of different knowledge is the key to success. The following will present my points.First of all, when one knows different region's works, it will help one to get a friend much easier. For example, I worked in a large company, which has many different departments. I was in the Management Information System department. What we do every day is to solve the problem that our clients asked in the phone. While some of the problems are the Engineering department's part, I went there and discussed with the colleagues there, since I have studied some of the engineering courses. It is much easier for us to contact than any other person in my department, which made me popular there, and much easier to get the help that I need.Second, when you want to translate your major, it is important to know some of the things about different fields. Take my cousin Jeff and his friend as an example. They majored in financing when they were in college. But, they decided to enroll in the art system after graduated. Thanks to Jeff's hard working during his leisure time, he learned a lot about the history of art. Things ended up that he joined in a great team, while his friend who only knew financing issues can do nothing but worked in a bank.Although I agree with the idea that knowing different fields is important. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that if one can’t success one’s own major, what else things he can do in different filed. Of course, it may be true when talking about this topic. However, what if one finally find out him or her has the talent in other filed. In this way, it won’t be a problem at all.In conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether having the knowledge in different fields is better or not are carefully compared. The best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that a broad knowledge of different subjects is really important.;In today’s rapidly changing world, the debate between broad knowledge across many academic subjects and specialization in a specific field is increasingly relevant. I assert that having a wide-ranging grasp of various disciplines is more beneficial than specializing in just one.Firstly, interdisciplinary knowledge fosters critical thinking and creativity. When individuals draw connections between different subjects, they often come up with innovative solutions that a specialist might overlook. For instance, consider the field of environmental science, which requires understanding from areas such as biology, chemistry, economics, and policy-making. A student well-versed in multiple domains is better equipped to tackle complex environmental issues than someone who is narrowly focused on one discipline.Secondly, broad knowledge enhances adaptability in the job market. The working world is evolving, and positions often demand skills that span diverse fields. For example, a professional in technology benefits greatly from understanding not only programming but also business principles, communication skills, and even design. A broad educational background allows individuals to pivot between roles and industries, making them more competitive and resilient in the face of change.Furthermore, broad knowledge fosters empathy and cultural awareness. Exposure to various disciplines often leads individuals to understand different perspectives, enhancing their ability to collaborate in diverse teams. This is particularly important in our interconnected global society, where the ability to communicate and work effectively with people from various backgrounds is crucial for success.In conclusion, while specialization can lead to expertise, the benefits of having a broad knowledge base are undeniable. It nurtures innovation, increases adaptability, and promotes understanding across cultures. In an increasingly complex world, a well-rounded education equips individuals to navigate challenges more effectively than specialization alone.
263;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Successful people try new things and take risks rather than only doing what they already know how to do well. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I have my own reasons why I agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks. There are many viewpoints regarding what the main characteristics of successful people are. In my opinion, one of the main reasons for supporting this statement is that successful people can learn important and very valuable points from trying new things. The other reason is that great success requires taking great risks.There are always interesting and useful experiences that successful people can learn them only by trying new things. For example, if you want to know how to act effectively when communicating with people, you can try something new like salesmanship in various stores and places. By selling goods or other commodities you will face different people with different behaviors and personalities and as a result you will learn how to behave people in different situations and jobs in the future. These experiences can only be obtained by trying new things and can’t be always found in books. I do believe that great success requires taking great risks. If you want to gain very high profits in investments, you should use great and very high amounts of money in very risky financial decisions and dealings in which you may lose much amount of money. If you want to achieve a remarkable success in an important exam, you should risk studying all the time and sacrificing your free time and your favorite hobbies. The more you take risks, the greater your successes will be. If you don’t take any risks, you will have an ordinary life with average successes. That’s why it is important to take risks.In sum, I believe that success and trying new things and taking risks go hand in hand and to achieve success you should consider them.;In today’s dynamic world, the path to success is often paved with innovation, experimentation, and a willingness to take risks. I firmly agree with the statement that successful people try new things and take risks, rather than solely sticking to what they already know. This approach not only fosters personal growth but also cultivates resilience and adaptability—qualities that are essential in navigating the complexities of life and career.Firstly, trying new things leads to the discovery of opportunities that might not be visible when tethered to familiar routines. For instance, consider the story of Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple Inc. Jobs’ determination to explore new designs and technologies led to revolutionary products such as the iPhone and iPad. His willingness to traverse uncharted territories allowed him to challenge the status quo, ultimately redefining industries and enhancing millions of lives. Had he opted to stick with conventional methods, his contributions to technology would likely have been far less impactful.Additionally, risk-taking contributes to resilience, which
264;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;I think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations. We should consider many factors and choose the best of them. I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons:We need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job. This can be done in school. In school, we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them. If we study them hard, we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future. For example, if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer, he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job. As you can see, studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job.One of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation. By relating well to people, we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication. Commuincation can bring many benefits. For example, if you need help with getting a job, by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well, you can achieve your goal. Or, if you are a salesman in a store or any other place, by relating well to your customers, you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers. So, relating well to people is also another important factor. In sum, though some people may disagree with me, as I explained my reasons and examples above, none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits.;In today's increasingly interconnected world, the ability to relate well to people is often seen as a crucial component of success in the workplace. While a strong academic background undoubtedly offers essential knowledge and skills, I argue that interpersonal skills and relationship-building are equally, if not more, significant for achieving success in a future job.Firstly, most jobs revolve around collaboration and teamwork. Employers seek individuals who can communicate effectively, understand diverse viewpoints, and foster a positive working environment. For instance, in fields such as marketing and healthcare, professionals must interact with various stakeholders, including clients, colleagues, and suppliers. An employee who can build rapport and navigate social dynamics is likely to enhance team productivity and drive project success. In contrast, someone who only excels academically but struggles to connect with others may find it challenging to contribute significantly in such collaborative settings.Moreover, the influence of networking cannot be overstated. Strong interpersonal skills enable individuals to forge meaningful professional relationships, which can lead to mentorship opportunities and career advancements. For example, attending industry conferences and events often leads to unexpected connections that can significantly enhance one’s career trajectory. Those who effectively engage with others in these settings often find job leads and collaborative opportunities that academically-oriented individuals might miss.Lastly, emotional intelligence, a key aspect of interpersonal skills, equips individuals to manage their emotions and understand the feelings of others. This ability is essential for conflict resolution, persuasion, and creating a supportive workplace culture. Employers increasingly value emotional intelligence, recognizing that employees who can navigate interpersonal challenges contribute to a thriving organizational atmosphere.In conclusion, while academic achievement is certainly important, the ability to relate well to people holds greater significance for future job success. Interpersonal skills not only enhance individual performance but also foster stronger teams and networks, leading to a more fruitful and fulfilling career.
265;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? The advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.;Advertising is becoming part of our modern society. They penetrate into people's life, affecting people's choices in different things. Therefore, it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people's life. Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits, while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people's judgments. In my opinion, the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.First of all, advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit. The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people's concept of wholesome diets and self-control. It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting, regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body. However, advertising is not the only information source for people. People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources, like news or magazines. As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits, they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations. It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors. Second, in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle, some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods. In other words, advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people. Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added. These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good. In these cases, the advertising industry bolsters people's awareness of having a healthy lifestyle. In conclusion, advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits. There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter. Besides, advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle. It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away. We will always be able to decide our own lifestyles.;"Advertising plays a significant role in shaping consumer behavior and can undoubtedly influence eating habits. However, to assert that it is the primary cause of unhealthy eating habits ignores a multitude of other contributing factors. I believe that while advertising does contribute to unhealthy dietary choices, it is not the main cause.Firstly, advertisements, particularly those promoting sugary snacks, fast foods, and convenience foods, often target vulnerable demographics such as children and adolescents. These ads frequently glorify unhealthy eating by depicting fast food as fun and exciting. Children, in particular, are impressionable and may develop a preference for these unhealthy options due to repeated exposure to such marketing. Nonetheless, the responsibility for dietary choices does not lie solely with advertising; parents and guardians play a critical role in influencing their children's eating behaviors. By offering healthy options and educating them about nutrition, they can counteract the allure of unhealthy advertisements.Moreover, lifestyle factors contribute significantly to eating habits. The fast-paced nature of modern life often leaves individuals with little time to prepare healthy meals. Economic constraints can also drive people toward cheaper fast food options, making them more accessible than healthier alternatives. Furthermore, emotional and psychological factors can influence eating behaviors, such as stress or binge eating, which advertising exploits rather than creates.In conclusion, while advertising undoubtedly contributes to unhealthy eating habits through its pervasive and persuasive messages, it is only one factor among many. Personal choices, familial influence, and socio-economic conditions significantly shape dietary habits. Thus, addressing unhealthy eating requires a more holistic approach that goes beyond critiquing advertising, focusing instead on education, accessibility to nutritious foods, and fostering a supportive food environment."
266;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"Nowdays there are different resources to entertain, educate and inform people. One of this resource is television; however television has some negative effects among some people. Therefore, I agree that Television has destroyed communication among friends and family. Some People spend a lot of time watching television, others even eat watching television, and some others make of this media a priority.First of all, some people spend a lot of time watching television. Instead of spend time with family and friends, they like to seat on a chair for hours. I know someone who wakes up in the morning and before even eat he turns the television on, he even records the programs he cannot watch during work hours. Sometimes his wife wants to talk before they go to work, but he only let her talk during commercials. So, she is used to his habit that she prefers to write him an email. Time with the family is gold, some people have to realize that and take quality of time to talk to them.Another way television has destroyed communication is when some people cannot even seat at the table and have dinner with the family. This is the time, when if they have children, they can share everything about school, a project and even concerns. Also, when there is a dinner with friends, some people do not have a fluid conversation because the television is again in between them. When family or friends gather together to have a good time eating and talking, this is not the reality in some cases.Finally, some people make the television a priority. I remember a friend told me one day that because she was watching a telenovela I could not go to her house a certain time during the night. Honestly, I was in shock! How she could say that to me?. As I have said, television is a great tool to learn, entertain and inform what is happening, but I agree that television has destroyed communication among friends and family as soon as television become a priority, spend a lot of time watching it and eat in front of the television.";"The assertion that television has destroyed communication among friends and family is a contentious one. While it is true that television can distract individuals and lead to a sense of isolation, I argue that it has not destroyed communication; rather, it has transformed it in ways both beneficial and detrimental.Firstly, television offers a platform for shared experiences. Watching shows or movies together can stimulate conversations and foster bonding among family and friends. For instance, a family might gather to watch a popular series, and this communal experience can lead to lively discussions about character motivations and plot twists, thereby enhancing interpersonal communication. In this sense, television can serve as a conduit for deeper connections.Moreover, television can also act as a source of information and inspiration that prompts dialogue. News programs and documentaries inform viewers about world events and diverse cultures. These topics often lead to important discussions in homes, encouraging critical thinking and strengthening relationships. For example, watching a documentary on climate change may lead a family to engage in a meaningful discussion about environmental conservation, thereby enriching their communication.On the flip side, it is undeniable that excessive television consumption can lead to reduced face-to-face interactions. Binge-watching can result in individuals neglecting quality time with loved ones. However, it is important to recognize that this challenge lies not with television itself, but with how individuals manage their viewing habits. Thus, the ultimate impact of television depends on individual choices and family dynamics.In"
267;Do you agree or disagree with the folowing statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support;University students can be divided into two groups, one group with less interest to study and the other which include hard working students. Usually the second group's members do not have enough time to do exercise. We all know doing exercise for at least 30 minutes form the basis of the healthy and happy life. But I don't think that equal amount of money should be spent on academic issues like libraries and laboratories and physical or social activities.First, in my view spending too much money for equipping the gyms or constructing football/basketball courts are really not necessary to encourage students to do sports. For example, my roommate, Mary, always wakes up 6 in the morning and spends 1 hour doing sport in the park which is near our dormitory. When she gets to the dorm, she is really full of energy and after taking a shower, she is ready to start a good day. As you see, she is doing exercise without spending a cent. What the university should do is informing the students the benefits of doing sport by hanging some posters in the campus, inviting some athletes to lecture for students and encourage them to spend some time for their body and health.In addition, students choose their major based on their interests. The university should provide the best equipment needed for physical education students. Because their major in completely involved in physical activities. In contrast, for an engineer or a medicine student I do not find it fair enough to equip gyms instead of their laboratories, because it really make the students enthusiastic to use innovative technology to learn and maybe find new things in their field.Finally, spending money on social activities looks like wasting money. For students who want to gather with their friends or want to go out to meet new people, university programs are the last place they would choose. For example when I and my friends want to spend time with each other, we prefer to go out of university to the places where we do not want to be disturbed by any familiar people. In conclusion, I do not deny the importance of doing sports in the success of university students, but I think both sports and social activities should not receive equal amount of money with libraries and laboratories.;The importance of sports and social activities in universities and colleges cannot be overstated. While academic programs and libraries are undoubtedly crucial for the educational development of students, I strongly agree that sports and social activities are equally significant and should receive equal financial support. Firstly, participation in sports helps students to develop essential life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and leadership. These skills are not only applicable on the field but also translate into academic and professional settings. For instance, when students engage in team sports, they learn how to collaborate effectively with others—a trait that is highly valued by employers. Furthermore, the physical benefits of sports contribute to overall well-being, which is essential for maintaining academic performance. Physical activity has been shown to increase concentration, reduce stress, and enhance cognitive function, all of which can lead to improved academic outcomes.Moreover, social activities play a crucial role in fostering a sense of community and belonging among students. College is often a pivotal period in young adults' lives, and social interactions contribute significantly to their personal growth. Creating opportunities for students to engage in social activities—whether through clubs, organizations, or recreational events—promotes inclusivity and diversity. These interactions can lead to lifelong friendships and networks that benefit both personal and professional lives after graduation.Additionally, universities that emphasize a holistic approach to education by funding both academics and extracurricular activities create well-rounded individuals. This, in turn, enhances the institution's reputation and attractiveness to prospective students. In conclusion, sports and social activities are integral components of the university experience that contribute to the development of not only the mind but also the body and social skills of students. Therefore, they should receive equal financial support alongside academic programs to ensure a balanced and enriching educational environment.
268;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? For success in a future job, the ability to relate well to people is more important than studying hard in school. ;To agree or disagree the statement that as far as getting a successful job in the future concerned, good ability of relating to people is more crucial than studying hard in the univeirsity is a matter of balancing its pros and cons. However, if one coniders the issue carefully, he or she may agree the title statement as I do.First of all, friends is a treasure with respect to either our daylife or our career. Relating well to people can bring plenty of merits to future job. Having a good ability of relate to people means you have a number of friends in a variety of fields, imagine when you are in trouble, you have a lot of people who have good relationship with you, so you can ask for your friends to help you solve this problem as soon as possible, even an esy phone call, instend of a series of complex solutions.Futuermore, no matter who you are a top-level managers of a company or a low-level employee of that company, relating well to people is also a importent issue. If top-level managers want to make a project successful, have a good relationship with their subordinaries is the prerequisit for the managers' work complete successfully, managers should listen to their employees needs and complaints about this job, pay much patiant and care to them. Consequently, make a good relationship with them.On the other side, if a low-level employee desire to enhance his position, it's fairly important to have a good relationship with their boss, only if the employee is considered excellent in his boss's eyes, he will be more possible to enhance position.However, someone may maintain that good specify knowledge is more crucial for future job. Studying harder in school, getting a good resume and absorbing lots of working knowledge, which can make these graduates more competitive than other applicants in one certain job. But imagine it, a person who is good at working knowledge but has an poorly relate to people, and a person who has a good ability of relating to people but his working knowledge is less better than the former, which person do you want to be? I think majority of people would choose the former because it has more chance than the latter in terms of getting good jobs in the future.In my point of view, I do really prefer to improve my ability of relating people and make more friends rather than studying hard in school.;The debate over whether interpersonal skills or academic excellence plays a more significant role in achieving success in a future job is multifaceted. While both aspects are undeniably important, I argue that the ability to relate well to people is increasingly paramount in today’s professional environment.Firstly, the modern workplace is inherently collaborative. Most jobs demand teamwork, where diverse groups of individuals must come together to accomplish common goals. Research shows that employers prioritize candidates who demonstrate strong communication and interpersonal skills over those who may excel academically but lack the ability to connect with others. The ability to effectively communicate ideas, understand team dynamics, and manage conflicts is invaluable, as these soft skills often determine a team’s overall productivity and morale.Moreover, networking plays a crucial role in career advancement. Building relationships with colleagues, mentors, and industry professionals can lead to numerous opportunities—be it in the form of job offers, promotions, or collaborations. Those who can create and maintain a strong professional network often find themselves in advantageous positions, regardless of their academic achievements.On the other hand, it is essential to acknowledge that academic knowledge provides a foundation of understanding necessary for many fields. Specialized skills and theoretical knowledge are crucial in professions like medicine, engineering, and science. However, it is the application of this knowledge through collaboration and effective communication that truly drives success.In conclusion, while academic performance can open the door to career opportunities, the ability to relate well to people is crucial for long-term success. As the workplace evolves to become more interconnected and collaborative, soft skills will increasingly outshine hard academic achievements. Thus, cultivating strong interpersonal abilities should be a priority for aspiring professionals.
269;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? As modern life becomes more complex, it is essential for young people to have the ability to plan and organize;With the fast rolling wheels of modern society, life becomes more complex and is not easy to handle than in the past. Therefore, it is essential for people, especially young ones, to possess the ability to plan and organize since it can improve the efficiency and reduce the crisis of our actions. Meanwhile, eliminating meaningless actions.First of all, great planning and organizing ability is able to cause our actions more efficient and productive. Take myself as an example, I used to be overwhelmed by the burden of preparing for the final exam, submitting my paper, and finishing my internship work at the end of each term. Yet, in this year, following the suggestion of my roommate, John, I make a to-do list to plan and organize perfectly everything I should get done in the final and hence take every tasks and trivials into control. This plan ability helps me a lot, making me climb to the top rank of the class while finishing everything else.Equally important, the capacity to plan and organize also help young people to eliminate the crisis in their actions, which may ruin one's whole effort over a very long time. As we all know, the employees in every company have to create profit as much as they can for their supervisors and complete their assignments perfectly. If some employees lack the ability to plan and organize ahead, they may get the procrastination and therefore take into action until the deadline is imminent. However, things have been changing all the time. For instance, the deadline of task is shifted to an earlier date for the change of company's schedule. In this case, those employees who did not plan and finish their assignments ahead of time perhaps are unable to finish these tasks on time and therefore will be penalized or get fired. Every employee can not afford this kind of loss.Finally, some assert that the ability to plan and organize can be learned until obtaining a job. Thus, it is not need for young people to possess this ability. Nevertheless, this ability is also essential for young people since young people can overcome their bad habits and fulfill their goals more quickly with this ability. As searching information on the internet, young people are probably distracted by other attractions such as online games or social webs. At this circumstances, they would surf on the internet for hours and end up no where. It is obviously a huge waste of time. But if they make their plan in the first place, and then stick to their plans, they could get their work done quickly beyond their imagination.In this complex society, we, young people, are encompassed with multiple tasks, so the ability to plan and organize is undoubtedly a powerful and sharp weapon that we must be armed with.;In today's rapidly evolving world, the complexities of modern life necessitate that young people develop exceptional planning and organizational skills. I firmly agree with the statement that these abilities are essential for navigating the challenges and opportunities that contemporary society presents.Firstly, the sheer volume of information available today can be overwhelming for young individuals. With access to the internet, social media, and various digital platforms, they are bombarded with choices and opinions. To filter through this chaos and make informed decisions, the ability to plan and organize is crucial. It enables them to set priorities, allocate time effectively, and focus on what truly matters amidst distractions.Moreover, the demands of academic life, intertwined with extracurricular activities and social commitments, require students to be adept at managing their time and resources. By honing their organizational skills, young people can balance their studies, hobbies, and personal responsibilities, which ultimately leads to a more fulfilling and less stressful life. A well-structured schedule not only enhances productivity but also instills a sense of accomplishment and boosts self-esteem.In addition, the workforce increasingly values the ability to plan and organize. In a competitive job market, employers seek individuals who can manage projects, work collaboratively, and adapt to changing circumstances. Young people equipped with these skills will not only stand out but also navigate their career paths more effectively.Lastly, the complexity of global issues such as climate change, social inequality, and economic uncertainties requires young leaders who can think strategically and implement organized solutions. By fostering these abilities, we empower the younger generation to become proactive agents of change.In conclusion, as life becomes multifaceted and interdependent, the ability to plan and organize is not merely beneficial but essential for young people. These skills are vital for personal success and for addressing the collective challenges of our time.
270;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.;Nowadays, it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities (options) as well. On the contrary to this popular belief, there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money. However, I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option.First and foremost, I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college. Also, they can help each other for learning materials better. However, if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems. Another significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points. In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study. Finally yet importantly, appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class’s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments. However, the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times. Through this way, they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study. On the basis of the points mentioned above, I convinced that communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials. Moreover, teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it. Also, attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success.;The debate over whether university students should be mandated to attend classes or have the option to choose is an intriguing one, with valid points on both sides. However, I firmly believe that attending classes should be a requirement for university students.Firstly, attending classes fosters a structured learning environment. Many students benefit from the discipline that comes with regularly scheduled classes. The commitment to attend classes enforces a routine, helping students manage their time and prioritize their studies. In a university setting, where the coursework can be challenging, this structure ensures that students are engaged and remain focused on their academic responsibilities.Moreover, attending classes allows for direct interaction with professors and peers. This dynamic can significantly enhance the learning experience. Professors can clarify complex topics, address students’ specific questions, and facilitate discussions that deepen understanding of the material. Engaging with classmates fosters collaboration and promotes diverse viewpoints, which are crucial in developing critical thinking skills. These interactions can also lead to networking opportunities that may benefit students in their future careers.Additionally, classes often include hands-on activities, demonstrations, and group projects that are difficult to replicate in an online or independent study format. These experiences are vital for students in fields that require practical application of knowledge, such as sciences, engineering, and the arts. While proponents of optional attendance argue that it promotes independence and responsibility among students, it may inadvertently lead to a lack of motivation and commitment to their education. In the formative years of higher education, it is essential to instill habits of accountability and the value of collaborative learning.In conclusion, mandatory class attendance not only cultivates a structured and engaging educational environment but also enhances interpersonal interactions that enrich the overall learning experience. For these reasons, I believe that university students should be required to attend classes.
271;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Telephones and email have made communication between people less personal. Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;There are many advantage of these invention, telephones and email. Communication between people by using telephones and email made my life easier. I personally disagree with this notion that these types of communication, telephones and email, made people less personal. I will give several reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, telephones and email help people, who live far away from other people, to connect each other. Unlike email, send message by using mail service could be lost and could be sent to wrong address. I can using telephones and email to talk or write directly to people I want to connect with. For example, right now, I am in the U.S. It is not possible to have conversation in person with my parents, who live in my country. Consequently, I can make a phone call or write email to my parents whenever I want. Telephones and email made me feel close to my parents.Second, using telephones and email could express some important words better than face-to-face communication. For instant, sometime when I argue with my friends, I cannot express my self to my friends at that moment. So, when I have a time to realize what had happened, I could explain the real thought that I want to express without emotion. Thus, these types of communications make me feel personal.Telephones and email make me feel personal because I could directly connect with people that I love. Beside, I could express my personal thought through telephones and email. As a result, I believe that telephones and email do not make communication between people less personal.;In today's fast-paced digital world, telephones and email are often viewed as tools that enhance communication. However, I argue that these technologies have made communication between people less personal. The reliance on such impersonal methods often detracts from the richness and depth of human interaction.Firstly, consider the nature of communication through email and telephones. While they facilitate quick exchanges of information, they inherently lack non-verbal cues such as facial expressions and body language, which are crucial for conveying emotions and intent. For example, a sincere apology delivered in person allows for eye contact and empathetic gestures, creating a more profound emotional connection. In contrast, an email or a phone call may lack the nuance needed to convey genuine empathy, often leading to misinterpretations or a sense of detachment.Moreover, the immediacy of emails and text messages fosters a culture of rapid communication that prioritizes speed over substance. This trend can result in superficial conversations, where relationships suffer from a lack of depth. For instance, a group of friends might exchange texts daily, yet miss the opportunity for meaningful encounters that strengthen bonds. As people choose the convenience of a generic email over a heartfelt letter or a casual coffee chat, they risk losing the personal touch that once defined their interactions.Lastly, the omnipresence of technology often makes individuals feel connected while simultaneously fostering isolation. People may have hundreds of contacts on social media yet feel lonelier, as digital exchanges replace genuine friendships. This paradox suggests that, despite having more channels for communication, the quality of those interactions has significantly deteriorated.In conclusion, while telephones and email are invaluable for efficient communication, they inevitably render personal interactions less meaningful. The emotional depth and connection that come from face-to-face conversations or handwritten letters are irreplaceable, highlighting the importance of balancing convenience with the essence of personal communication.
272;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific examples to support your answer.Ê;I highly prefer living in a big city to living in countryside. The big cities have lots of advantages and facilities over the small towns. Where a person lives and grow up is very important to his future life, because the environment that a person grow up, build the personality and his/her culture.There are lots of social places in big cities like restaurants, museums, bars, sporting clubs, cinemas, theatre and etc. People in big cities have many options to enjoy their life and spend their times with their friends in social places in contrary to people living in small towns who have few choices and at most cases one bar or one cinema to socialize with their friends.In big cities educational facilities is quite better than small towns with more experienced and profession teachers. It’s undisputed that in this modern world education has a very important role in the human kind future life. Better education results better career and been well paid. So persons in big cities have more chance to get the better job than people living in small towns. Also lots of companies placed in big cities and there are more job positions in there than small towns.But by living in big cities one sacrifices quiet and peaceful life with breathing fresh air and loses much time in traffic and anyway for transportation, because distances in big cities often are too far to pass quickly. Every technology has it’s good and bad effects but I prefer having the technologies with their disadvantages to living like 16 century without any of modern facilities of technology. In addition to what mentioned, medical technologies is completely better in big cities and in my view this profit overcomes all the bad influences of technologies on human kind.In conclusion, in my view living in big cities is quite funnier and better and more exciting than living in small towns because of many more social places, technologies facilities, better education and medical services.;When it comes to choosing a place to live, the decision between a small town and a big city often hinges on personal preferences and lifestyle choices. Personally, I would prefer to live in a small town. The tranquility and sense of community that a small town offers are features that greatly appeal to me.One of the primary advantages of living in a small town is the slower pace of life, which provides a more relaxed lifestyle. In small towns, one can enjoy the beauty of nature and open space, whether it’s through parks, local farms, or scenic trails. For instance, the simple pleasure of taking a stroll down a quiet street, with trees lining the sidewalks and children playing in yards, is a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of a city. This environment promotes mental well-being and allows individuals to connect more deeply with their surroundings.Moreover, small towns foster a strong sense of community and personal relationships. Everyone knows their neighbors, and there is often a spirit of cooperation and support. Events like town fairs, farmers' markets, and community picnics create opportunities for residents to interact and build friendships. Unlike large cities, where people can feel isolated even amidst crowds, small towns encourage a neighborly atmosphere that can lead to lasting relationships.Furthermore, smaller towns tend to be more affordable, allowing residents to manage their finances better. The cost of living is typically lower, enabling individuals to own homes and live comfortably without the financial strain that often accompanies city living. For someone who values financial stability and security, small towns present more opportunities for a balanced life.In conclusion, while big cities may offer a diverse array of activities and cultural experiences, my preference leans towards a small town. The peaceful lifestyle, tight-knit community, and affordability create a nurturing environment that aligns more closely with my values and aspirations.
273;Some people like to do only what they already do well. Other people prefer to try new things and take risks. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your choice.;You may love to try new things and take risks even if you aren't good at the things. That may help you expand experiences, look for your personalities and find your new talents. This ideal, however, doesn't necessarily be accomplished. If not, you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things. So, I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at.Focusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal. Without doubt, the more time you spend on what you do well, the more likely to achieve something great you will be. For instance, Albert Einstein, one of the most competent physicians in history, devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity. Instead, he hardly cared about something else. It is said that, surprisingly, he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because, at least for him, using two different soups properly was quite annoying. As the example above indicates, you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well.If you keep doing what you already do well, you can be better good at it. When you're doing something well, you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it. Then, you will motivate yourself to do more. To give an example, I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school. Because I was really satisfied with the fact that I could do preferably, I became to absorb myself to try more advanced level of math problems. As a result, I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems. Thus, by doing what you are good at, you will be better at it.In summary, doing what you can already do well helps you make a big accomplishment and do it much better.;In the ever-evolving landscape of personal and professional development, the choice between sticking to familiar activities and venturing into new experiences often shapes one’s growth trajectory. Personally, I gravitate toward the latter—embracing new challenges and taking calculated risks. This preference stems not only from a desire for personal growth but also from the exhilaration of discovering untapped potential.Engaging in new activities can lead to a heightened sense of accomplishment. For instance, when I decided to learn the guitar, I faced initial struggles with chords and strumming patterns, yet the joy of making progress far outweighed the frustration. Each small victory fueled my determination to keep experimenting with different songs and styles, ultimately enhancing my musical abilities and broadening my artistic expression. This experience taught me that stepping outside my comfort zone can unlock new skills and perspectives.Moreover, exploring new opportunities fosters adaptability, a crucial trait in today’s dynamic world. By taking risks, I have learned to approach problems with creativity and resilience. For instance, during my internship, I was assigned a project that required knowledge of data analysis—a field I had no prior experience in. Instead of shying away from the challenge, I sought help from colleagues and utilized online resources to learn the necessary skills. The outcome not only impressed my supervisors but also enriched my understanding of data-driven decision-making.In contrast, while sticking to what one does well can lead to mastery in a specific area, it often limits exposure to diverse experiences. Personal growth thrives on challenges and the willingness to embrace uncertainty. In a rapidly changing world, adapting through exploration is essential for both personal satisfaction and career success. Thus, my inclination toward trying new things and taking risks is a fundamental aspect of my journey toward becoming a more versatile and resilient individual.
274;In order to become financially responsible adults, children should learn to manage their own money at a young age. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?;One of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility, specially in financially matters. Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility? many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood. I am a kind of person who believes to children should learn to manage their own money at a young age, due to reasons that I stated below.The first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life, even though when we are not borne. So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues. To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood, when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked. First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished. I asked my father for extra money, but he refuse to give it to me. I found that I should manage the way that I spend money. From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted.Another aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family. If parents get the children all they wanted, they would be run out of their money for their essential needs. Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money, when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity. As a case in point, I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family, his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood. He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money. His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life, but unfortunately it was useless. Finally one night, having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car, he crashed a truck and died. Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property, but also bring sorry to his family.Although some people argue that children should be free to spend money to they what they want, In my opinion it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons, because our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood.;"The importance of teaching children how to manage their own money cannot be overstated in our increasingly complex financial landscape. I strongly agree that instilling financial responsibility in children at a young age is essential for their development into financially savvy adults.Firstly, financial literacy equips children with the necessary skills to make informed decisions about money. By learning the basics of budgeting, saving, and spending wisely, children develop the ability to differentiate between needs and wants. For instance, when children receive an allowance, they can practice allocating funds for various purposes such as saving for a larger purchase or contributing to a charity. This practical experience lays the foundation for responsible financial behavior, helping them understand the implications of their spending choices before they reach adulthood.Additionally, instilling financial responsibility early on encourages the development of critical life skills such as goal setting and discipline. When children set savings goals, be it for a new toy or an outing, they learn the importance of delayed gratification. This skill not only prepares them for future financial endeavors but also fosters a sense of achievement and confidence when they reach their goals. Furthermore, the earlier children are introduced to financial concepts, the more likely they are to carry these lessons into their adult lives. Studies have shown that individuals who learned about money management during childhood tend to exhibit healthier financial behaviors in adulthood, such as prudent saving, investing, and avoiding excessive debt.In conclusion, teaching children to manage their own money is crucial for fostering financial responsibility. By equipping them with the skills necessary to navigate financial challenges, we empower the next generation to make informed decisions, achieve their goals, and build a secure financial future. Such education is not merely beneficial; it is essential for nurturing a responsible and economically empowered society."
275;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Dancing plays an important role in a culture. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;In every country, people do dance for fun, for entertrain, and for decrease a stress. Dancing is also one of important parts of culture that represent to something that people believe. Many cultures do dance to show a great prosperous of its culture. And also dancing to entertain people. I will give reasons to support my opinion.First, dancing are significant part of culture that could show to something that people believe. For example, some culture people believe that they dance in order to sacrifice to their god so they will be get a happy life. Or some part of the world that are in arid area believe that if they danced, the rain would come. Consequently, dancing are the part of people belief.Secondly, dancing can represent to civilization of that culture. For instance, I have seen many western movies that when a kingdom have visitor from another kingdom, king or queen would dance to show a splendid of their kingdom culture. The way of movement, the way that they costume and also a music while they dance. All this is a civilization of their culture.Thirdly, many culture, people have many ways to entertain themselves. And dancing is one of that ways. Both people who see and dance also have a good time. For example, many event, such as christmas, last christmas I went to mall to buy gifts, and I was entertained by group of people in santa custom dancing in christmas song. I felt that people around me happy and group of santas also happy to see people happy.In conclusion, I strongly agree with notion that dancing is an important part of culture because dancing are represent to believe of people. Besides, dancing could show how civilization of that culture is. Moreover, people use dancing to entertain themselves. So dancing is important in every culture.;"Dancing undeniably plays a significant role in cultures around the world, serving as a vital form of expression, communication, and community bonding. I strongly agree with the statement that dancing is essential to cultural identity and heritage.Firstly, dance is an ancient form of expression that transcends language barriers. It allows individuals to convey emotions, tell stories, and share experiences that might be difficult to articulate through words. For example, traditional dances often recount historical events or celebrate milestones in a community's life, preserving narratives that inform and educate future generations. The Hula dance of Hawaii, for example, intricately incorporates storytelling through movement, encapsulating the rich traditions and beliefs of Native Hawaiian culture.Moreover, dancing fosters a sense of community and belonging. Cultural dances often bring people together during festivals, celebrations, and religious ceremonies. This communal participation not only strengthens community ties but also reinforces shared values and collective identities. In societies where dance is integral, such as the Samba in Brazil, these dance forms become focal points of cultural pride, encouraging unity among diverse groups of people.Additionally, dance serves as a means of cultural preservation in an ever-globalizing world. Many indigenous cultures use dance as a tool to maintain their distinct identity amidst external influences. For example, the Powwow dances of Native American tribes not only celebrate their heritage but also act as lively demonstrations of cultural resilience and continuity. These performances not only reconnect participants with their roots but also revive interest among younger generations, ensuring dance traditions are not lost over time.In conclusion, dance is more than just an artistic endeavor; it is a cornerstone of cultural expression and identity. Through its ability to convey emotions, foster community, and preserve traditions, dancing plays an indispensable role in enriching and sustaining cultures worldwide."
276;Do you agree or disagree with following statement? It is more important for students to understand ideas and concepts than it is for them to learn facts.;There are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not. Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students, I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives. In the following, I will state my reasons for this choice.First, when students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations. As a case in point, more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts. As a result, they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better. Second, it would improve students' social behavior. If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well. They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well. Thus, if they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life. Moreover, these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts. As a matter of fact, when a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently. In my viewpoint, concerns and anxieties are very destructive in everybody's life. It can prevent person to progress and thrive in every position. All in all, I am in the belief that learning facts is more beneficial for students in both social and individual life in the view of above-mentioned reasons. Students would improve their social positions and encounter their problems in positive ways and also intend in the more confidence manner and etc.;"In the modern educational landscape, the debate between the importance of understanding ideas and concepts versus memorizing facts is a pivotal one. I firmly agree with the statement that it is more important for students to grasp ideas and concepts than merely to learn facts. This perspective is increasingly relevant in a world characterized by rapid change and complex problems that require critical thinking and creativity.Understanding concepts fosters deeper learning and enables students to make connections between different areas of knowledge. When students comprehend the underlying principles of a subject, they can apply this knowledge to real-world situations. For instance, a student who understands the concept of gravity can better appreciate its implications in various scientific disciplines, from physics to astronomy. This ability to transfer knowledge is essential in an age where information is abundant, but meaningful application is often scarce.Moreover, an emphasis on concepts rather than rote memorization promotes critical thinking skills. Students engaged in exploring ideas are encouraged to ask questions, analyze situations, and develop their own viewpoints. This process cultivates a mindset that values inquiry and problem-solving, traits that are vital in navigating life’s challenges. In contrast, fact-based learning often leads to superficial understanding; students may recall information for exams but fail to retain it or understand its application in practical scenarios.Lastly, the digital age has transformed access to information. With a wealth of knowledge available at their fingertips, students are less likely to benefit from mere memorization. Instead, educators and learners alike should prioritize fostering comprehension of key concepts that allow for deeper engagement with the material and encourage a lifelong love of learning.In conclusion, understanding ideas and concepts provides the foundation for meaningful education, critical thinking, and the ability to adapt to an ever-changing world. Thus, prioritizing conceptual understanding over mere factual recall is essential for preparing students to thrive in the future."
277;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? At universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as classes and libraries and should receive equal financial support. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;There are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes. It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities. Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges, I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students' lives. In the following, I will state my reason for this choice.First, besides the good body shape, sports have very vital effects on human's healthfulness. In my viewpoint, our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly. As a case in point, last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back. After that exam, I felt depressed and exhausted. Therefore, I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well! As a result, sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health.Second, besides the academic knowledge, the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human's life. As a practical epitome, students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation. Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other's mind and different environment. In my opinion, social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment. So, social activities have same rights to receive monetary support.Moreover, they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments. If we follow just one wing of my life i.e., studying as a student, after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn't have any motivation. Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends. In my perspective, more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me.All in all, I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above-mentioned reasons. They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way.;I firmly agree that at universities and colleges, sports and social activities are just as important as academic pursuits and should receive equal financial support. While the primary purpose of higher education institutions is to foster learning and intellectual growth, the holistic development of students involves a balance between academics and extracurricular activities.Firstly, sports and social activities play a crucial role in promoting physical health and well-being among students. College life can be demanding, with rigorous coursework often leading to stress and anxiety. Engaging in sports not only provides a necessary outlet for relieving stress but also fosters a sense of community and belonging. For example, participating in team sports cultivates teamwork, discipline, and leadership skills—attributes that are essential in the workforce. Universities that invest in sports facilities and programs equip students with lifelong skills that extend beyond academics.Moreover, social activities enhance the overall college experience, offering opportunities for personal growth and networking. Events such as cultural festivals, workshops, and student clubs enable students to explore diverse interests and develop social skills. These activities can often lead to meaningful connections that might otherwise be absent in purely academic environments. For instance, students involved in clubs or extracurricular projects frequently build professional networks that are invaluable during job searches post-graduation.Furthermore, the inclusion of sports and social activities in a university’s agenda promotes a more inclusive environment. Students from various backgrounds can come together, breaking down barriers and fostering understanding and collaboration. Such an atmosphere enhances personal development and enriches the academic environment itself.In conclusion, while academic classes and libraries are unimpeachable pillars of the university experience, neglecting the importance of sports and social activities undermines the holistic education of students. Allocating equal financial resources to these areas not only supports physical health and social skills but also prepares students to thrive in all aspects of life, making them well-rounded individuals in an increasingly complex world.
278;Some people say that the internet provides people with a lot of valuable information. Others think access to so much information creates problems. Which view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In the modern society, internet is considered as one of the most important inventions over the past century. Some people believe that several problems occur from an information on the internet. However, some say that the internet provides a lot of valuable information. In my opinion, I agree with the latter because the internet gives daily necessary information, people can gain knowledge and they can explore the world.First of all, everybody would like to know what is going on around the world in their everyday lives. Sometimes, they want an information that can help them in daily life which the internet can provide all of these to people. For example, a businessman who has no time to watch a television or read a newspaper can receive news and check stock markets easily via the internet.In addition, people can gain more knowledge by using the internet, the most useful technology in the world. Many people such as students can take online courses to study at home or they can watch beneficial videos which also teach them knowledge. Not only students but also everyone could get more information and knowledge. For instance, people who have problems with their health can search for more information about it.Last but not least, The internet makes the world becomes smaller which is a good thing. This is because people who have no time or have financial problems could travel around the world by using the internet. They can see lots of picture and videos of many interesting places. Moreover, people can learn other countries's culture and tradition which makes them have more knowledge about that nations.To conclude, people are satisfied with the internet and sometimes even thanks it because it helps us in studying, doing business and exploring the world. With valuable information it provides, people can enjoy their lives much more.;The internet has undeniably transformed the way we access and share information. On one side of the argument, many people assert that the internet offers a wealth of valuable information, empowering individuals with knowledge on almost any subject. This access can greatly enhance education, encourage self-learning, and foster informed citizens. Resources like online courses, academic articles, and digital libraries allow anyone with an internet connection to explore diverse topics. For instance, platforms like Khan Academy and Coursera provide free or affordable educational materials, making learning accessible to a global audience.Conversely, there are valid concerns regarding the overwhelming abundance of information available on the internet. The sheer volume can lead to confusion and misinformation, as not all online content is credible or accurate. The rise of fake news and sensationalism has made it increasingly difficult for individuals to discern truth from falsehood. This problem is exemplified by the spread of misinformation during critical events, such as elections or global health crises, where public perception and action can be misguided by unreliable sources.In my opinion, while the internet indeed provides immense value through its vast information resources, it also necessitates a degree of caution and discernment. It is crucial for users to develop critical thinking skills that enable them to evaluate sources and validate information. Educational curricula should integrate digital literacy, equipping future generations with the tools to navigate the complexities of online information effectively.In conclusion, the internet is a powerful repository of knowledge that can enhance our understanding and engagement with the world. However, to fully realize its benefits, we must also address the challenges it presents and cultivate a society capable of discerning credible information from the multitude of voices competing for attention online.
279;Some universities require students to take classes in many subjects. Others universities require students to specialize in one subject. Which is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University is the place that provides people knowledge and skills to use in their real life. Some universities require students to study in one subject. On the contrary, others require students to study in several subjects. In my point of view, studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in, they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future.First of all, when students finished their high schools, they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities. This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all. For example, pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music. Therefore, requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them.In addition, people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one. Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study. For instance, university students who study business are also know history of the world. Furthermore, students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers. Hence, they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another.Finally, students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career. This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer. For example, students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include. Moreover, bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge.In concluding, learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject because it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future.;The issue of whether universities should require students to take classes across a range of subjects or allow them to specialize in a single discipline has sparked substantial debate. Each approach offers distinct advantages, and the optimal choice often depends on the individual student's goals and circumstances.On one hand, universities that promote a broad curriculum enable students to acquire a diverse skill set and knowledge base. This policy fosters a holistic education where students can explore various fields, such as humanities, sciences, and arts, fostering critical thinking and creativity. For instance, a student majoring in biology who also takes courses in philosophy may develop stronger analytical skills and an ethical framework for evaluating scientific innovations. This interdisciplinary approach prepares students for an increasingly complex world where jobs often require versatile skills and the ability to collaborate across various domains.Conversely, specializing in one subject can be particularly advantageous for students aiming for a specific career. Such depth of knowledge is essential in fields like medicine, engineering, or law, where expertise is crucial. A dedicated program allows for intensive study and practice, equipping students with the skills and insights necessary to excel in their respective fields. For example, an engineering student who immerses themselves fully in technical courses may have a better grasp of advanced concepts needed for real-world applications.Ultimately, the question of which approach is better cannot be universally answered, as it significantly hinges on personal aspirations and career paths. Students with broad interests may thrive in diverse learning environments that promote a well-rounded education, while others with a clear career goal may find greater success in specialized programs. A balanced approach that incorporates elements of both strategies could also be ideal, allowing students to obtain a foundational breadth of knowledge while also delving deeply into their chosen specialization. This flexibility could ensure they are well-prepared for future challenges in their academic and professional lives.
280;Some people think governments should spend as much money as possible exploring outer space (for example, traveling to the Moon and to other planets). Other people disagree and think governments should spend this money for our basic needs on Earth. Which of these two opinions do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Although developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting, there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation. Thus, these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity. Therefore, in my opinion, I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first.First, as you can see that after great economic recession, many people in many countries were unemployed. Then, many people did not have money. When people did not have money, They had to rob other people. There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities. Consequently, quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy. So that, government should invest to create more jobs. When people have jobs, they did not have to steal money. Therefore, criminal rate were drop. Thus, people have a good quality life.Second, environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it. Nowaday, industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide, which caused of greenhouse effect. Greenhouse effect causes of climate change. These impact on every living creature in the world. So, government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide. In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide, government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy. If we lived in good environment, our life would be better.Lastly, family is a root of society. If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other, that family could have problems, If family had problems, it mean society could have problems. When society had problems, it could impact to a nation. Thus, government should create campaign to fill love to family. For example, setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other. When family understand each other, it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble.In conclusion, I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs. The basic needs: jobs, good environment, and love in family. These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people.;The debate over government spending on space exploration versus addressing basic needs on Earth is both complex and vital. While the allure of discovering the cosmos is undeniable, I align with the perspective that governments should prioritize spending on essential earthly needs.First and foremost, addressing pressing social issues should be our primary concern. There are millions of people worldwide who lack access to basic necessities such as food, clean water, healthcare, and education. Allocating significant funds to outer space programs diverts attention and resources from these critical areas. For instance, with billion-dollar budgets dedicated to missions to the Moon or Mars, we could alleviate poverty, support public health initiatives, or invest in renewable energy sources to combat climate change. These efforts would generate immediate benefits, improving lives and fostering a healthier society.Furthermore, focusing on our planet allows for a more sustainable approach to progress. Technological advancements inspired by space research are certainly valuable, but many of these innovations can be developed in tandem with solving earthly problems. Investing in sustainable technologies can address climate challenges and reduce our impact on the planet, ensuring that Earth remains a viable home for future generations.A broader perspective reveals that our responsibility to our planet and its inhabitants should take precedence over the mysteries of the universe. While space exploration does possess its merits, such as inspiring global cooperation and scientific advancements, we must first ensure a base level of well-being for all. Ultimately, by prioritizing spending on pressing earthly needs, we invest not only in our immediate survival but also in a sustainable future for all humanity. Therefore, it is essential that governments focus their resources on solving the problems we face on our planet before venturing into the unknown of space.
281;People have different ways of escaping the stress and difficulties of modern life. Some read, some exercise, others work in their gardens. What do you think are the best ways of reducing stress? Use specific details and examples in your answer. ;Nowadays, we are living in in the world which is absolutely complicated. Everything seem to be rush, and it have a lot of competition. These make people get stress. Thus, many people try to reduce their stress. There are many activities that could relieve those people who are in stress. in my opinion, reducing stress by listening to music, playing sports, and doing meditation are easy and practical ways.First of all, listening to music is a great way to relax. For example, when I go to office, I use public transport. I see many things such as traffic jam, crowded people at bus stop, and all so crowded people in buses. These make me stress. So that I always listen music from my mp3 player. I could enjoy listening music without thinking of people around me. Consequently, I feel happy when I listen music.Second, another way that is perfectly work for everyone to reduce the stress is exercise. For instance, I alway have many things in my mind such as a difficult of my work that I have to finish in time. These problem sometime make me hard to fall asleep because it make me stress. Thus, after work, I always do exercise, and jogging is my favorite sport. I feel that after working out, I am easily to fall asleep. Exercising not only reduce my stress but also make me get a good health.Third, meditation also one of the ways to reduce the stress. when I have many things to think about, and this make me stress, I will do meditation. Meditation is easy way to relax because it is not require any equipment, and it take few minutes. A way to do meditation is that I just sit down, close my eyes, and count my breath. These could relieve me from stress. In conclusion, there are many ways to reduce the stress. In my point of view, listening to music, exercising, and doing meditation are the most activities that people could do to escape from stress. It is are easy and usable. And everyone should find the time to do more and more to feel better physically and in everyone mind.;"In today's fast-paced world, stress has become a prevalent issue that affects many individuals. As people navigate the complexities of modern life, finding effective ways to escape stress is essential for maintaining mental well-being. Among the myriad of options available, I believe that exercise, reading, and practicing mindfulness are some of the most beneficial methods for reducing stress.Firstly, exercise serves as a powerful stress reliever. Physical activity releases endorphins, which are hormones that elevate mood and promote a sense of well-being. Engaging in activities such as running, swimming, or even walking can clear the mind and provide a much-needed break from daily pressures. For instance, a study by the Mayo Clinic revealed that just 30 minutes of moderate exercise can significantly reduce anxiety levels and improve overall mood. This confirms the long-standing notion that ""a healthy body leads to a healthy mind.""Secondly, reading offers another effective escape from the burdens of life. Immersing oneself in a captivating book allows individuals to temporarily step away from their worries and enter a different world. Whether it’s fiction, history, or self-help, literature has the power to transport readers and provide comfort, insight, and even laughter. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many turned to books as a way to cope with isolation and uncertainty, highlighting the therapeutic nature of reading.Lastly, practicing mindfulness and meditation has gained popularity as a method to combat stress. Mindfulness encourages individuals to focus on the present moment, fostering a sense of peace and reducing anxiety. Techniques such as deep-breathing exercises or guided meditations can significantly lower stress levels. Research from Harvard University indicates that mindfulness meditation can physically change the brain, leading to increased emotional regulation and resilience.In conclusion, while there are numerous ways to escape stress in modern life, exercise, reading, and mindfulness stand out as particularly effective. Each of these methods addresses mental health challenges in unique ways, offering individuals the chance to find relief and restore balance in their lives. By incorporating these practices into our daily routines, we can better equip ourselves to handle the stresses that arise in the contemporary world."
282;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn. Give specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;Everyone is different. Although students are in the same process of education system, learning abilities in each students are not equal. Some students are fast learner, but some students are not. Thus, paying for teacher base on grade that students got is not appropriate, and it is not fair for teacher. So that, I disagree with this notion.To begin with, in schools, main task of teacher to give knowledge to students, and this role have to finish in time. there are certain period of time for teachers to teach. In these short time, it is not possible for teachers to pay attention to individual students in class. Teachers have to manage to teach every topics by schedule. If teachers pay attention to specific students, their work might not finish on time, and this might make many student miss some field in topics that they should know.Second, learning abilities in each students is different. It is not possible that they all comprehend all lessons in the same period of time. Some students might understand all topics that they had learnt but some are not. Therefore, testing result are different. This problems depend on how hard study they do. It is not teachers fault. Thus, teachers should not be paid by testing result that students get.Lastly, there could lead to a big problem if schools pay teachers by grade that students get. That is problem in quality of education. Teacher may not care about how they have to teach to make students understand the topics. Teachers may just give high grades to get higher salary. This problem should not be happened. Therefore, grade that students get should not be in evaluating teacher.In conclusion, I totally disagree with this statement that teachers should be paid by how much their students learn because teacher could not pay attention to each students in class. Besides, learning abilities of student are different. Moreover, there are problems if paying teacher by grade students get.;The question of whether teachers should be compensated based on their students' learning outcomes is a contentious one, inviting diverse opinions on the efficacy and fairness of such a model. While the idea of tying teacher salaries to student performance may seem appealing in theory, I fundamentally disagree with this approach. Firstly, measuring learning outcomes is complex and multifaceted. Student achievement is influenced by a plethora of factors beyond a teacher’s control, such as socioeconomic status, parental involvement, and individual learning capabilities. For instance, a teacher who works in a low-income area with limited resources may encounter significant challenges that hinder student progress, irrespective of their teaching quality. Penalizing teachers in such contexts for their students' performance could lead to a loss of morale and could dissuade talented individuals from pursuing a career in education.Moreover, the emphasis on standardized testing as a primary measurement of learning success is problematic. These tests often fail to capture the full scope of a student's abilities and knowledge. Students who excel in creative or critical thinking areas might not perform well on standardized tests, which could unfairly affect their teachers’ evaluations. This narrow focus on specific metrics could lead to teaching approaches that prioritize test preparation over holistic education, stifling creativity and critical thinking in favor of rote memorization.Finally, teaching is inherently a collaborative effort. It involves various stakeholders, including teachers, parents, and the community. Holding teachers solely accountable for their students' achievements neglects the role of others in the educational ecosystem and oversimplifies the intricate process of learning.In conclusion, while the intent behind linking teacher pay to student performance is understandable, it is an oversimplification of the educational landscape. A more equitable approach would consider a broader range of factors that contribute to student learning and recognize the dedication of teachers in facilitating growth, no matter the circumstances.
283;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Movies and television programs should present stories in which good people are rewarded and bad people are punished.;When we watch movies or dramas, some of us like to see good people have a good ending and bad people are punished. While there are also some people who do not like this. Personally, I prefer to see good people get rewarded. However, if the good people always get an happy ending, I don’t think it’s proper.First, if all the story end up in the same way, it will be boring. If good people always win, we can guess the ending of the movies or dramas. Then we will feel less interested in them. But if the good people are not always rewarded, we will try to finish the movie or dramas to find out the end of the story. For example, Hollywood stories usually have a happy ending like a hero beats a crime and get a girl. But now many people, including me, have been tired with it. I don’t want to see the same kind of ending again and again. So we can’t always let good people be rewarded in movies or TV programs.Even in the real world, good people can get a bad ending sometimes. And I think it happen more often in the real world than in those movies. So if children always watch the TV programs that good people get rewarded, they may think it will be true in the real world. They will be misleading by those movies. And they may act like good people in order to get reward. Once they find the good people are not always get rewarded, they may feel upset and not to be a good person. But in fact, the good people do good things no matter the ending is good or not. So we should tell this to the young children to avoid the misunderstanding.In fact, those good endings sometimes are helpful. Some people may be encouraged to do good things. But like I said, this kind of behavior won’t last long, because someday they will realize the truth. So I suggest we should show people the truth in the stories. And if they can, they will be good people no matter how the story ends.Based on my arguments above, I think movies and TV programs should present different stories in which good people get reward or get nothing.;The debate over whether movies and television programs should consistently depict stories where good people are rewarded and bad individuals are punished is a thought-provoking one. I firmly agree with this statement for several reasons.First and foremost, media serves as a powerful tool for shaping societal values and norms. When films and television shows present narratives that uphold the idea of moral justice, they reinforce viewers' belief in a fair world. This can be particularly beneficial for younger audiences, who are still forming their understanding of ethics and morality. By witnessing good characters triumph and receive their rewards, and bad characters face consequences, children and adolescents learn valuable lessons about the importance of integrity, compassion, and personal responsibility.Moreover, such narratives can offer emotional satisfaction and closure for audiences. The resolution of conflicts in favor of virtuous characters tends to evoke feelings of happiness and hope, enriching the viewing experience. Stories that highlight the triumph of good over evil can inspire individuals to strive for righteousness in their own lives, providing role models that promote positive behavior and ethics.On the flip side, some may argue that reality often diverges from such neatly wrapped narratives, where the bad sometimes prosper and the good suffer. While this is true, it should be noted that entertainment often serves as an escape from harsh realities. Audiences gravitate toward stories that depict justice because they seek affirmation of their beliefs and a respite from life's unpredictability.In conclusion, I believe that movies and television programs should present narratives where good people are rewarded and bad people are punished. This not only instills hope and fosters moral values in viewers but also enhances their overall viewing experience by providing satisfying resolutions. Overall, emphasizing justice in storytelling is a critical element in both entertainment and societal development.
284;Distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning.;There are many advantages of distance learning, but it should not replace classroom learning. Learning in classroom could provide more information to study. Besides, learning in classroom are not only learning academic skills but also learning social skills, and learning how to solve problem in real situation. Consequently, I completely disagree with this statement that we should replace normal course with online course. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, learning in classroom could provide more information and make students more comprehend in subjects that they had learnt. Because in classroom have many equipment to demonstrate real example. For example, in biology class, learning anatomy by operating fog have many benefits. Learner could learn how to use tools and see actual organs of fog. Unlike classroom, online class just only study in textbook not learnin real situation.Secondly, online class could not provide knowledge about social skills. For instance, In a classroom, teacher could give assignment to student to work as a group. This could help students to learn how to deal with people, how to collaborate with people in their group. This important skill cannot be gotten in online classes.Lastly, learning in classroom, student could have healthier life because in school can provide exercise class which train student to move their body. Classroom have specialist trainer to teach students to it right way. If student do it by themselves, they might be hurt themselves. This make students have healthier life which online class cannot provide. In conclusion, I personally disagree this this notion that we should replace classroom with online class. Because, classroom could provide real actual example to make students more understand in their subject. Besides, classroom courses are also provide students to learn social skill. Moreover, classroom could provide exercise class to set students to have a good health. Thus, having classroom could provide abundant skills to students.;In recent years, the landscape of education has significantly evolved with the advent of technology. Distance learning and online computer classes have emerged as viable alternatives to traditional classroom learning. Advocates argue that this shift can enhance accessibility, customization, and overall efficiency in education.One of the most compelling arguments for replacing classroom learning with online education is the increased accessibility it offers. Students from various geographical locations, including those in remote areas, can benefit from high-quality resources and instruction without the need to travel. This democratization of education allows individuals who might face barriers due to distance, economic constraints, or health issues to access learning opportunities that were once beyond their reach. Furthermore, online platforms can accommodate a diverse range of learners, enabling each to engage at their own pace and according to their individual schedules.Additionally, online learning provides a level of customization that traditional classrooms often lack. In a conventional setting, the pace is typically dictated by the collective needs of the class, which can leave some students struggling to keep up while others may become disengaged. Online courses, however, often allow students to revisit lectures and materials at their convenience, thereby promoting a more personalized learning experience. This self-directed approach not only fosters a deeper understanding of the subject matter but also cultivates critical skills such as time management and self-discipline.Critics may argue that the social interaction found in classrooms is vital for personal development. While these interactions are important, advancements in technology have facilitated a new form of connection through virtual classrooms and discussion forums, where students can engage with peers and educators alike.In conclusion, distance learning and online computer classes present a modern solution that can enhance the education system by making learning more accessible and customizable. As we continue to leverage technology’s capabilities, it is essential to evaluate these approaches critically, ensuring they complement rather than completely replace the necessary human interactions that are integral to the educational experience.
285;What are some of experiences that have shaped your outlook and the way you live now.;Many circumstances that I experienced change the way I think. There are many experiences that are improve my life in many way. For example, I could improve the way that I solve problems, improve how I take care of my health, and improve to plan my life for future. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, studying in university taught me to be more prudent person to solve problems. For example, in math class, the way that we learnt to find an answer by doing step by step. Start with find cause of problem and the way to do research to solve the problem. I could adapt this method to use my real life. When I want to go to somewhere, I try to find the way to reach to destination. Which ways are shortest and which ways are less consume my time. I could find a better way to solve problems.Secondly, Some experiences could teach me the way to take care of myself. For instance, reading and listening the news about choosing a good diet are the way to keep myself are more healthy. Thus, I am always buy a quality food such as organic food. This food are not have chemical. So that, I can have a good health. This experience teach me to aware my health.Lastly, experiences are also change to plan for my future life. For example, I read about saving money for my retire is a good plan for my life. Consequently, I start changing myself from spending many thing that I want to saving money for my entire life. This experience change me to concern about making plan for my future life.In conclusion, experiences that shape my thinking and the way to live my life are teach me to be a better person. Because I could find a better way to solve problems. Besides, experiences could shape me to be more aware about my health. Moreover, these experiences could make me to make plan for my future life. These experiences taught me to change my life to be a better person.;Throughout my life, several pivotal experiences have significantly shaped my outlook and the way I live now. One of the most profound moments occurred during my volunteer work at a local shelter. Engaging with individuals facing homelessness opened my eyes to the complexities of societal issues that I had previously only considered from a distance. It taught me empathy and the importance of human connection. Witnessing the resilience of people, despite their struggles, encouraged me to be more grateful for my circumstances and to strive to make a positive impact in my community.Another experience that greatly influenced my perspective was my family’s relocation to a different city during my adolescent years. This transition was initially challenging, as I had to leave behind friends and familiar surroundings. However, it ultimately fostered adaptability and open-mindedness within me. I learned to embrace change and appreciate the beauty of diversity, as I was exposed to new cultures, ideas, and ways of life. This exposure has instilled in me a curiosity about the world and has encouraged me to seek out experiences that expand my understanding of different perspectives.Additionally, my academic journey has played a crucial role in molding my outlook. Engaging deeply with subjects such as philosophy and sociology has pushed me to question norms and think critically about my beliefs. Discussions about ethics, morality, and social justice have ignited a passion for advocacy, pushing me towards a lifestyle that values fairness and equality.In conclusion, my experiences have taught me the importance of empathy, adaptability, and critical thinking. They have inspired me to live purposefully, seeking to understand others and effect positive change. These lessons continue to guide my decisions and interactions, shaping my identity and commitment to living a life rooted in compassion and understanding.
286;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreigh language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Give the advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Knowing foreign language is became more and more important in this time. Many people pursue to study foreign language. There are two options to learn foreign language. First is stay in homeland to study foreign language. The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken. Going to another place to learn language is better choice. I will give reasons to support my opinion.To begin with, going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language. For example, everyone around me speaks foreign language, and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people. If I could not communicate with other people, I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger. This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language.Secondly, having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster. For instance, English school in outside my home country, there are many people that come from different places and from different languages. The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language. Thus, I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong. This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster.In conclusion, I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people. Besides, in foreign country I could have a chance to speak foreign language with my friends. Learning foreign language form another country is better choice for me to study language.;Learning a foreign language can be a transformative experience, opening doors to new cultures, ideas, and opportunities. However, individuals can choose to acquire a foreign language either in their home country or in the country where that language is predominantly spoken. Both methods have unique advantages that cater to different learning styles and objectives.Learning a foreign language in one's own country allows for a structured environment, often with trained educators who can provide tailored instruction. Access to language classes is typically more convenient, especially for those with busy schedules or obligations. Additionally, resources such as textbooks, online courses, and study groups are readily available. This approach usually helps build a foundational understanding of grammar and vocabulary without the pressure of immersive circumstances. However, it may limit exposure to authentic language use and cultural nuances.On the other hand, learning a language in its native context offers an unparalleled immersive experience. Living in a country where the language is spoken provides daily opportunities for practice, improving fluency and comprehension rapidly. Engaging with native speakers allows learners to pick up colloquialisms, slang, and cultural references that are often missed in a classroom setting. This real-world interaction fosters not only language skills but also cultural appreciation, enhancing the learning experience.In my opinion, while both methods are valuable, learning a foreign language in the country where it is spoken is more advantageous for achieving fluency and a deeper understanding of cultural context. The ability to engage effectually with native speakers and experience the language as part of everyday life significantly accelerates the learning process. Ultimately, the best approach may be a combination of both environments, allowing learners to master the language’s technical aspects at home while also immersing themselves in its practical application abroad. This holistic approach can lead to greater proficiency and cultural connection.
287;If you could change one important thing about your hometown, what would you change? Use reasons and specific examples to support your answer.;Public utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place. However, it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements. In my hometown, there are almost complete public utilities for one’s needs but transportation. So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation. Since I’m facing the traffic congestion every day. And this problem seem to get worst. At first, it should have more alternatives to use public transportation, such as a subway train or a sky train. Hence, people will have more ways to go to a place. Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community, It makes people in this area have no choice. They must take only a bus to go to another place. If a subway and a sky train are available here, it will be more convenience to them. For example, people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule. On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus. Also, this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly. Secondly, the buses provide merely two routes in this community. It is absolutely a major problem. For example, if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses, I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus. Obviously, it is waste of time. They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily.Lastly, having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars. Also, it provides many advantages. For instance, people can save their expenses form gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive. The necessary energy will slowly be used up, since people use less their own cars.To sum up, the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people’s living. I wish one day this problem would be changed. And then, the transportation in my hometown is no longer difficult for everyone in this community.;If I could change one important thing about my hometown, it would undoubtedly be improving public transportation. While my hometown has a charming small-town feel and a close-knit community, its reliance on personal vehicles creates significant challenges, including traffic congestion, air pollution, and limited access to essential services.Firstly, enhancing public transportation would reduce traffic congestion. Many residents depend on their cars to commute to work, school, or even to run simple errands. This reliance leads to overcrowded roads during peak hours, making it difficult for commuters to get to their destinations on time. By introducing an efficient public transit system, such as buses or trams, the number of cars on the roads would decrease, resulting in smoother traffic flow and less frustration for drivers.Moreover, improved public transportation would significantly benefit the environment. Currently, the high volume of vehicles contributes to air pollution, diminishing the quality of life for residents. A robust public transit system would encourage more people to leave their cars at home, lowering greenhouse gas emissions and fostering a healthier atmosphere. For instance, cities that have invested in public transportation systems, such as Amsterdam or Tokyo, have seen substantial improvements in air quality.Lastly, a well-developed public transit system would increase accessibility for those without private vehicles, such as the elderly and low-income families. This would enable them to reach employment opportunities, healthcare facilities, and educational institutions more easily. For example, without reliable transit, many individuals may struggle to access jobs, thereby perpetuating cycles of poverty.In conclusion, revamping public transportation would not only alleviate traffic issues and environmental concerns but also enhance the quality of life for all residents. By implementing a comprehensive public transit system, my hometown would not only become more efficient but also more inclusive, reflecting the values of community and sustainability.
288;Schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Getting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance. Thereby, evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system. Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students. Therefore, I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers.To begin with, Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance. For example, evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product. Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information. Consequently, teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give. Therefore, evaluating from students could improve teachers' performance.Additionally, this evaluation from students could improve schools' quality. Teachers could augment their quality. Consequently, When school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality. For instance, in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high. Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students.Finally, people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students. Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance. Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects, students could comprehend their subject easily. As a result, students, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life.In conclusion, I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance. Moreover, schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers. Furthermore, students are easy to understand their subjects. Thus, I believe that there are benefits to ask students to evaluate their teachers.;The notion of having students evaluate their teachers has become a topic of considerable debate within the educational community. While some argue that such evaluations can foster improvement in teaching methodologies, I firmly believe that students should be encouraged to share their feedback on their teachers. This practice not only enhances the educational experience but also empowers students to take an active role in their learning environment.Firstly, student evaluations can provide valuable insights into a teacher's effectiveness. Students, being the primary recipients of teaching, are uniquely positioned to assess how well educators communicate concepts and engage their classroom. For instance, if a teacher’s explanations are often confusing or their methods fail to resonate with students, this feedback can prompt necessary adjustments. When teachers are made aware of areas needing improvement, they can adapt their approaches to better suit the needs of their students, ultimately leading to a more productive and enjoyable learning experience.Moreover, allowing students to evaluate their teachers promotes a culture of open communication and accountability. It fosters an environment where feedback is not only welcome but encouraged, which is essential for personal and professional growth. Teachers who receive constructive criticism can harness this feedback to refine their teaching strategies, thereby improving their effectiveness and maintaining high engagement levels in their classrooms. Additionally, involving students in the evaluation process cultivates a sense of responsibility and ownership over their education. When students learn to articulate their opinions about the effectiveness of their education, they develop critical thinking and evaluation skills that are vital for their future endeavors. It empowers them to recognize that their voice matters, which can lead to a more collaborative and respectful educational atmosphere.In conclusion, implementing a system where students evaluate their teachers can yield numerous benefits, from enhancing teaching quality to empowering students. While it’s crucial that evaluations are conducted thoughtfully and constructively, I wholeheartedly agree that student feedback is an invaluable tool in the continuous quest for educational excellence.
289;Some people prefer to work for a large company. Others prefer to work for a small company. Which would you prefer? Use specific reasons and details to support your choice.;Companies vary from small to large ones based on the context, success and needs of their work. Small companies usually have a local job in the area, while large companies work in an international context providing for the entire nation or even for other foreign countries. I personally prefer to work for a large company for several reasons.First, to find a job in a large company is way more easier than to find a job in a small company. Large companies always look for new skilled employees to fill in their need of distributing, managing and selling their products in different countries. For example, if a large company decides to open a branch in a foreign country, they would need more employees in that country to work there. In other words, Large company equals more job opportunity.Second, I think that a large company can give better salaries than a smaller one. The fact that a company is a large one, this means that it's having a considerable success. In other words, this means that the company can give more salaries to its employees. For instance, common sense would tell us that a famous and international known company won't give the same salary as a small local company.Third, I love travelling around the world. large companies have an international reputation, as they organize international conferences, meetings and workshops which will give me the opportunity to travel in different countries and meet new people. As well as learning new skills in my field from these workshops.In conclusion, i can certainly state that I would rather prefer working in a large company than in a small one. I have different reasons to hold that, such as having a better chance to find work, having a better salary and having the opportunity to travel around the world to attend international conferences.;When considering employment options, the choice between working for a large company or a small company often comes down to personal preferences and career goals. While both environments offer unique benefits, I prefer working for a small company. My inclination stems from the opportunities for personal growth, the close-knit community, and the potential for meaningful impact.Firstly, small companies typically provide an environment where individuals can wear multiple hats and take on varied responsibilities. This breadth of experience is invaluable for personal development. In a smaller setting, employees often have the chance to engage in projects across different departments, allowing them to acquire diverse skill sets that would be less accessible in a larger organization, where roles tend to be more specialized. This holistic exposure not only enhances my abilities but also makes my work experience richer and more fulfilling.Secondly, the collaborative culture found in small companies fosters stronger interpersonal relationships among colleagues. With fewer employees, team members frequently work closely together, creating an atmosphere of camaraderie and support. This connection can lead to a more enjoyable work environment, where people feel valued and appreciated. The flat organizational structure often found in smaller companies encourages open communication and idea-sharing, which leads to innovative solutions and a strong sense of belonging.Lastly, working for a small company allows me to see the direct impact of my contributions. In a larger corporation, it can be easy to feel like just another cog in the wheel, but in a smaller setting, my efforts can have a significant effect on the company's success. This sense of purpose boosts motivation and job satisfaction, making my work more meaningful.In conclusion, the advantages of working for a small company—ranging from personal development and close relationships to the ability to make a tangible impact—align closely with my professional aspirations. These factors make small businesses the ideal environment for my career growth and fulfillment.
290;Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students. Discuss these views. Which view do you agree with? Explain why.;No one can disagree that knowledge is the most important for everyone. College and university are playing in an important role to provide academic skills to people in order to pursue their goal. There are an issue that some people agree that this opportunity should be preserved for good students however there are others people who think that everyone should have this chance to gain these advance skills from college or university. This issue will be discussed.First of all, many people think that college and university should consider students to study with them only if they are good students. The reason is that studying in advance education take a huge of money. College and university do not want people who not qualify for to waste their money in these expensive courses and waste their time. They believe that only good students have potentials to success programs more that those who are not considered as good students. Consequently, mediocre students are not have a chance to gain these advance knowledge from college and university.On the other hand, there are some people think that all students should have equal opportunity to study in higher education. Of course, higher education take a lot of money and a lot of time however moderate students should have a chance to try. Everyone that has strongly ambition could pursue and success their goal even they are not classified as a good student because people can change. With a good environment in college or university is encouraging students to study harder for a good future. Thus, mediocre students should have opportunity to be trained in college and university.In conclusion, I personally agree with that college and university should be available for all students who want to pursue their goal. Students can have opportunity to learn, to practice, to gain more knowledge for their career and for their future. Studying in college and university is a great opportunity that all students should have.;The question of whether higher education should be universally accessible or reserved for only the most proficient students is a contentious issue that reflects broader social values. Those in favor of universal access to college and university education argue that education is a fundamental right. This perspective emphasizes that higher education serves not only to empower individuals with knowledge but also to contribute to a more informed society. By making higher education accessible to everyone, societies can foster diversity, innovation, and a workforce that is well-rounded, drawing from various backgrounds and experiences. Moreover, in a rapidly changing job market where many careers require advanced skills, it is imperative that all students have the opportunity to pursue further education irrespective of their academic background.On the other hand, proponents of restricting higher education to high-achieving students contend that this approach would maintain higher academic standards and ensure that resources are allocated efficiently. They argue that admitting only those who demonstrate strong academic abilities encourages a competitive environment, motivating students to excel. This viewpoint often invokes the idea of meritocracy, suggesting that individuals who work harder and achieve higher grades deserve the opportunity to advance their education.While both viewpoints have their merits, I lean towards the belief that higher education should be accessible to all students. The potential societal benefits of an educated populace outweigh the concerns regarding academic standards. Access to higher education can serve as a great equalizer, offering opportunities to individuals regardless of their socio-economic background. Rather than restricting education, we should focus on better preparatory programs in high schools to equip all students with the necessary tools for success in college. By investing in education for everyone, we promote social equity, stimulate economic development, and foster a culture of lifelong learning that benefits society as a whole.
291;Playing Computer Games wastes time and students should not be allowed to play it.Ê;It is a debatable subject that children should not be allowed to play computer games since playing computer games is a a waste of time. I hold a positive view against this opinion. First and foremost, a large number of students are obsessed in on-line computer games and as a result their performance in school are declined. An investigation done by Beijing University shows that 80% of the students who failed in the final exam paid 2 hours or more on-online games every week, while 90% excellent students expressed that they did not touch computer games during the most of the days. Recent research by Scientist also reveals that the youngs are more likely to be attacted by and lose themselves in these computer games, because of their low control ability. Second, children could learn nothing from these computer games, therefore time on this activity is really time wasting. Since all these games are developed for commercial purpose and in order to catch the eyes of the children, majority of the games use war, violence, bloody, or sexual subjects to lure the students. However, those subjects are not suitable for the students and will bring bad effects to the youths. Admittedly, there are a few students paying considerable time on the computer games playing finally choose computer games related jobs as their career. But we have to realize the fact: majority of the students failed in front of the computer games playing and they use their time for studying, sleeping and physical exerice to play these computer games. It is not uncommon that the teenages are found sleepless for several days playing on-line games at public internet bar, and there are also some media reports regarding the sudden death case of the teenages in the internet bar. In conclusion, I believe it is better that children are not be allowed to play the computer games. The computer games are like cigerate to adults and we need to set up rules to regulate this area.;In recent years, the debate surrounding the impact of computer games on students has intensified. Many argue that playing computer games is merely a waste of time and should be restricted for students. This perspective is grounded in the belief that excessive gaming leads to procrastination, a decline in academic performance, and detrimental effects on physical and mental health.First and foremost, the pressing issue is the potential for academic decline due to time spent gaming. Students often find themselves absorbed in virtual worlds, causing them to neglect their studies and essential responsibilities. Research has shown that students who spend more time on video games tend to have lower grades, as they may prioritize gaming over homework, projects, or studying for exams. This can lead to a cumulative effect, ultimately impacting their ability to perform well in school and pursue further educational opportunities.Moreover, gaming can foster a sedentary lifestyle, which poses health risks. Many students spend hours in front of screens, leading to a decline in physical activity. This lack of movement can result in various health issues such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and poor posture. Furthermore, the immersive nature of gaming can contribute to mental health challenges, including anxiety and depression. The social isolation that can come from prolonged gaming sessions further exacerbates these issues, as students may replace real-life interactions with virtual connections.While it is essential to recognize that not all gaming is inherently negative, the focus should be on moderation. In a structured environment, where gaming is limited and does not interfere with academic responsibilities or health, it can serve as a reward or an enjoyable leisure activity. Nonetheless, the argument remains that unrestricted access to computer games often leads to adverse outcomes. Thus, it is reasonable to impose limitations on gaming for students to encourage a more balanced lifestyle, prioritizing their education, health, and overall wellbeing.
292;Do you think classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by e-mails. Why?;When it comes to the question whether classmates or colleagues should work on projects in person or by email, I am of the view that wok in person is preferred because this means help to achieve a good communication. Firstly, team members may have different views and they need to reach a union opinion efficiently. Obviously, discussion face to face in a meeting is much better than by emails. An experiment conducted by the Beijing University asked two groups of people to discuss the budget of an activity. The first group was asked to discuss in person, while the second group was asked to discuss by email. The result shows that the 1st group used 30 minutes to reach the agreement on the budget, while it takes 30 hours for the later one. The similar experiment done by other scientist show the same result that people can reach an agreement quickly if they could talk to each other. Secondly, work in person can indirectly improve the quality and the efficiency of the project because there will be less conflicts or fight amongst the team members. Writing an email for an informal matter will make that matter looks official, therefore people who receives the email may feel nervous or maybe feel offended by the words in writing. While if the same words are expressed in talking, the counterparty will feel more relaxed since their response will not be recorded and they will not misunderstand the informal discussion to an official claim. Therefore, less misunderstanding leads to less conflicts and fights, and enhance the communication amongst the team members. Admittedly, sometimes we have to use emails if the team members are not located in the same place. Although emails are not convenient for the work but it is better than none. Since it is a classroom or campus projects, there is few possibility that the project members are located in different areas. While we should realize that in a project, there are numerous coordination works are required, if each opinion is communicated via email, there will be hundreds or thousands of emails there that we know this is not a good experience. In conclusion, I prefer the project members to work in person rather them by email because work in person will be more efficient.;In today's technology-driven world, both in-person collaboration and digital communication through emails have their advantages and disadvantages in executing projects. However, I firmly believe that classmates and colleagues should prioritize working on projects in person whenever possible. The benefits of face-to-face interaction far outweigh the conveniences of remote communication.First and foremost, in-person collaboration fosters stronger relationships and promotes a sense of community among team members. When classmates or colleagues work together in the same physical space, they are more likely to engage in spontaneous discussions, brainstorming sessions, and problem-solving activities. This dynamic not only enhances team cohesion but also allows individuals to build rapport and trust. Strong interpersonal relationships can lead to improved teamwork, as members feel more invested in each other's success and the project's overall outcome.Moreover, in-person communication enables immediate feedback and clarification. When working on a project, misunderstandings can arise, and resolving them promptly is crucial to maintaining progress. Face-to-face conversations allow for real-time dialogue, where individuals can ask questions and receive instant responses, reducing the likelihood of miscommunication that often occurs in written correspondence. Non-verbal cues such as body language and facial expressions also play a significant role in enhancing communication and understanding, aspects that are often lost in emails.While emails offer convenience and flexibility, they can lead to delays in communication, as responses may not be instantaneous. Additionally, lengthy email threads can become confusing and overwhelming, leading to important details being overlooked. Therefore, when seeking effective collaboration, face-to-face interactions are more advantageous.In conclusion, while both methods of communication have their place, working on projects in person leads to better relationships, immediate feedback, and clearer understanding. Emphasizing in-person collaboration can significantly enhance the quality and success of group projects, making it the preferred approach for classmates and colleagues.
293;Some people think university professors should spend more time doing research while others think they should spend more time educating students. What is your view?;These days, more and more university professors are involved in scientific research. Some are afraid that this will lead to the decline of education quality and suggest them to spend more time on teaching. However, according to my experiences, professors should be encouraged to mainly do research.First of all, doing research is a method of self-improvement for professors. Universities are relatively fenced environment. The research projects provide communication with the outside. In addition, by doing research, professors could catch up with the latest development of modern technologies. I still remembered that my professor took part in several research projects when I was in college. He was often invited to do speech in other universities. Although my university is not in the high-ranking list, he gained a reputation by those projects. The research projects like windows opened to the wider world.Secondly, professors should fully use the research-friendly environment provided by universities. It is very common to see state-of-the-art laboratories in the campus. Also, you could not find another place with so much talent people gathering together. Consequently, there is really no reason to discourage professors from using those advantages. We all know that Einstein developed the theory of general relativity when he was a professor in HU Berlin. Universities positively contribute the professors' success. Last but not least, doing research could also improve the teaching quality. With the help of research projects, professors could lead their students into the practical world from the classroom. They can easily teach students how to imply the knowledge in practice. I still remembered the experience of being an assistant in one of my professor's research project. By participating in it, I had opportunities to use theories on textbooks in real life experiments. The research project provides a more efficient way of teaching. For those reasons, it is natural to support the professors spending more time on doing research. While extending the way of their own development, the outcomes of the researches will also benefit the whole society.;"The role of university professors has traditionally been multifaceted, encompassing both teaching and research responsibilities. While the necessity for cutting-edge research in academia is undeniable, I believe that university professors should prioritize educating students. A balanced approach is essential, but ensuring that students receive quality education must take precedence for several reasons.Firstly, the primary mission of educational institutions is to foster learning. Students attend universities not only to gain knowledge in their field but also to develop critical thinking and analytical skills. Professors play a fundamental role in this process, influencing students’ intellectual growth and preparing them for future careers. If professors allocate excessive time to research at the expense of teaching, the quality of education may suffer, leading to a disconnect between academic theory and its practical application.Moreover, the educational experience is not solely about content delivery; it involves mentorship and personal interaction. Professors who are more engaged in teaching can better connect with their students, provide meaningful guidance, and inspire them to pursue their interests. Such relationships can significantly enhance student motivation and performance, creating a more enriching academic environment.On the other hand, research is essential for driving innovation and contributing to a field's body of knowledge. However, when professors prioritize research over teaching, they may inadvertently neglect their responsibility to shape the next generation of thinkers and leaders. Universities should view teaching and research as complementary rather than mutually exclusive; nevertheless, teaching should be viewed as the foundation upon which effective research is built.In conclusion, while research is vital to the progression of knowledge, the sacred trust of education remains the paramount duty of university professors. By investing more time in teaching, professors can create a profound impact on their students, equipping them with the skills necessary to thrive in a rapidly changing world."
294;Do you learn better by yourself or with a teacher ?;Every person learn in their own manner which they think that is most expedient to them. As for the learning by yourself, it has some certain profit. It gives you a chance to concentrate on what you learn cause there is no one who distracts your attention in presence of you, and your learning becomes more profound. In addition, the learning with a teacher makes us bear more burdens of studies cause they assign us homework, Nevertheless, I prefer to learn with a teacher rather than learn by myself. Firstly, The distinguishing fact of the learning with a teacher is that you can ask about problems related your studies. In other words, when we encounter difficulty in our study which we can not make out, that asking the difficulty from our teacher is propitious way for us to solve it instantly. In addition, professors and teachers have much experience and knowledge, and are so dextrous with letting students understand their study. They know something which are not incorporated in such materials as books and webpages. Hence I, in my class, often communicate with my teacher to find a coordinated answer to a my faced problem, and my classmates are so accustomed to communicating with the teacher. Secondly, in my mind, the learning with a teacher is more efficient than by myself. We can accomplish our assignments with little help of a teacher within less time than do it by ourself. Furthermore, the teachers play important role in leading us to right direction. Moreover, This gives us opportunity to rise our educational level to an exited degree. knowledge may be thereby better improved and strengthened.Finally, of course, being without a teacher has shortcomings. Notable one of the shortcomings is that if someone faced so complicated confusion in his study and his many endeavors on making out it were miscarried, this might be ended in disappointment. I think that for one who depends on only himself in learning, his improvement of ability, with regard to cooperation and express his opinion, is unpromising. Hence I support this point that the learning with a teacher is better.;The question of whether one learns better independently or with the guidance of a teacher is a complex issue that varies greatly among individuals. Both methods hold unique advantages and can cater to different learning styles, thereby influencing the effectiveness of the educational experience.Learning independently allows for a personalized education, where students can explore subjects at their own pace. This autonomy encourages self-discipline, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Independent learners often develop a deeper interest in the material since they choose topics that resonate with them. Additionally, they can adjust their study methods, employing tools and resources that suit their learning preferences, whether that be through reading, online courses, or hands-on experimentation.On the other hand, learning with a teacher provides structure, direction, and feedback. A skilled educator can offer explanations, clarify doubts, and present challenging concepts in an accessible way. Teachers have the ability to identify a student’s weaknesses and strengths, helping to tailor lessons that enhance understanding. Moreover, the collaborative environment of a classroom fosters social learning, where students can engage in discussions, share perspectives, and benefit from diverse insights. The interactive nature of teacher-led learning can also motivate students who thrive within a community, providing encouragement and accountability that may be lacking in solitary study.Ultimately, the effectiveness of learning independently or with a teacher depends on individual preferences and needs. Some may find autonomy liberating and conducive to deeper inquiry, while others may require the support and guidance of a knowledgeable instructor to navigate complex subjects. A balanced approach that combines both methods often yields the most rewarding results, integrating the personalized exploration of self-directed learning with the invaluable insights provided by skilled educators.
295;Technology designed to make people's lives simpler often turns out to make them more complicated.;Many people think they are blessed to be in the era of high technology. With newly developing technologies, people are able to carry various tasks more convenient and easy. For example, we no longer have to travel to DMV to renew our driver's license or drive to bank for sending money. Ancient people would probably think that we are like magicians. However, even with all the conveniences, we would have to admit that technologies made our lives more complicated. There are couple reasons and examples to support my answer.Of course, new technologies are always great. However, it takes time for people to adapt them. Since we are informed with devices that are produced with new features nearly every day, many people often get lost. For instance, I use new Iphone which I personally think is great. However, even though I used it for couple months, I still do not know how to use all the features proficiently. At first, I tried to go through all the instructions but, soon, I gave up because I found out that it is time-consuming and there are too many things to learn. Next, technology destroys the language. Ever since people used computers or cellphones to chat with others, they created their own language to communicate. Because people try to type as fast as they are talking, they use a lot of abbreviations and broken language. This has gotten worse with twitter, myspace, and facebook. What are even worse, young people who are still in the early ages are exposed to them and impeded by the newly developed inventions. To clarify, my younger brother does not know how to spell the words correctly and he talks to his friends with terms that I have never heard of. I have tried to correct him for couple times but he just thinks that I am too conservative.Although technologies allowed us to have a convenient life, it has made our lives more chaotic according to the reasons mentioned above.;In today’s fast-paced world, technology is often heralded as a bastion of convenience, designed to simplify our daily routines and enhance our quality of life. However, upon closer examination, it becomes evident that these advancements frequently lead to increased complexity rather than the promised simplicity. One of the most salient examples is the proliferation of smart devices. Initially, gadgets such as smartphones and smart home systems were introduced as tools to streamline tasks, offering users the ability to control various aspects of their lives at their fingertips. However, as these devices have become more sophisticated, so too have their operating systems and the multitude of applications available. The potential for inconvenience arises as users find themselves grappling with constant software updates, the need for connectivity, and various compatibility issues. What was once a straightforward process of, for instance, turning on lights now requires navigating multiple apps, understanding complex settings, and troubleshooting when things go awry.Moreover, social media platforms epitomize the paradox of technological advancement. Designed to foster connections, these platforms often generate feelings of isolation and anxiety. Instead of uniting people, the curated online personas lead to unrealistic comparisons, while the barrage of notifications creates an overwhelming sense of urgency to stay updated. This complexity in our social interactions can exacerbate mental health issues, contrary to the initial goal of enhancing socialization.Additionally, the advent of automation, once seen as a means to lighten workloads, has resulted in the challenge of job displacement, creating economic uncertainties and necessitating the continuous reskilling of the workforce. In conclusion, while technology undoubtedly holds the potential to simplify our lives, the reality is often more nuanced. As we integrate these tools into our daily lives, it is crucial to remain mindful of the complexities they introduce, ensuring that we harness their benefits without succumbing to the complications they may cause.
296;Nowadays, distance-learning programs are such common thing for us, but some people argue that they're not as good as those by attending in a college or university in person. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"There are some people who believe that distance learning and online computer classes should replace classroom learning while there are some people who strongly disagree with this opinion. As far as I am concerned, I strongly believe that online classes should never replace classroom learning. I list my reasons as follows.First, indeed classroom learning is the best way to provide education comparing to online classes. In the classroom environment you can learn from your classmates, because if you see any of your classmates who is performing better, it will force you for making your performance more better. For example, When I was in First Year in B Com, I was not serious in my study, but when I saw some of my friends who took better grades than me, it influenced me and I intended to do better in my subjects. Finally I got 1st rank in final exam.Second, in classroom learning you have to complete study work on time. It makes you perfect in time management skills. Moreover you can learn by participating in group studies how to communicate with others. It makes you communication and of course your group skills better, which can help you in your future and career.Third, professors play vital role in classroom learning, most of them are specialists is their subjects, and they help you by giving valuable information and useful skills. You can improve your skills by work under any professor; you can ask questions face to face, it will clear your doubts. In result you learn quickly. For example, I have my personal experience. For Toefl IBT Coaching first I was depend on some online courses, but after 1 month I realized that I was wasting my time so I joined an institute for preparation of Toefl IBT, and in 1 month I felt that my English skills have been improving faster.It's undeniable that online classes have some advantages so they could be used as supplementary, but they could not be substitute of existing classroom learning. From the discussed above, we can easily draw the conclusion that the classroom learning is the best way to provide education for these reasons.";Distance-learning programs have gained significant traction in recent years, particularly accelerated by global events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. While some argue that these programs lack the benefits of traditional in-person education, I contend that distance-learning can be equally effective, albeit with certain limitations.One of the primary advantages of distance learning is its accessibility. Students can participate in courses from anywhere in the world, breaking geographical barriers that often limit educational opportunities. This flexibility allows individuals with work or family commitments to pursue their studies without needing to relocate or alter their schedules dramatically. Furthermore, online education can be more affordable, as it eliminates the costs associated with commuting, housing, and materials.Additionally, technological advancements have enhanced the quality of distance-learning programs. Interactive platforms, live lectures, and collaborative tools help create a rich educational environment that mirrors traditional classrooms. Many programs also incorporate multimedia resources, including videos, podcasts, and forums, which can cater to various learning styles, enabling students to engage with the material in a more personalized way.However, the limitations of distance learning must be acknowledged. One significant drawback is the lack of face-to-face interaction, which is crucial for developing interpersonal skills and building professional networks. In-person education fosters a sense of community and camaraderie that can enhance the learning experience. Moreover, some disciplines, particularly those that rely heavily on hands-on experience, may not translate well to an online format.In conclusion, while distance-learning programs offer distinct advantages in terms of flexibility and accessibility, they cannot fully replicate the rich experience of in-person education. Therefore, a balanced approach that integrates both formats may provide the most comprehensive educational outcomes, allowing students to benefit from the strengths of both modalities.
297;In some countries, teenagers have jobs while they are still students. Do you think this is a good idea? Support your opinion by using specific reasons and details.;"When we talk about student, we generally mean a boy or a girl who study in school or college. In some country, teenage students have the opportunity to do some part time job beside their study. However, some people do not support the concept of teenagers doing job beside study. In my view, it is good for a teenager to do a part time job while he/she is still a student and this is for two reasons.The main reason is that students can learn lots of things from part time job, before starting their real job. Students can learn about time management, money management and convince people by their words. For example, when I was in my high school I worked as a sales-man in a shop for a year. As i had to spend some of my time in my job, therefore, i had to manage my time efficiently. I had to manage my boss as well as had to prepare my homework. This taught me how to manage time efficiently and do any job quickly and effectively. Moreover, I learn money management. When my boss was out of the shop, i had to manage the accounts section of the shop. From this i learned, how to manage money correctly. This experience taught me, doing part time job can help students to learn many things.Another reason is that from part time jobs students can earn money, which can help their parents. For instance, when i was in high school I worked as a home tutor. I taught math to two kids of my neighbor. I helped them to understand the difficult topics of the books. By tutoring them, i earned some money and bought me books with it. Moreover, after taking that part time job i stopped taking my pocket money form my parents. As you can see, part time job can help students earn money and which can help their parents financially.In sum, I am sure; some people will oppose the idea of part time job for students. They will argue, it can destruct students from their study. However, as i did part time job in my high school and it did not hurt my academic result; therefore, i believe part time job will be good for students. Every Student should do part time job beside their study if they want to prepare more efficiently for their future.";The practice of teenagers holding jobs while still attending school has been a topic of debate across various societies. While some argue that it can take away from educational pursuits, I believe that working while studying can provide essential life skills and financial benefits that are invaluable for young individuals.Firstly, having a job can foster a sense of responsibility and time management in teenagers. Balancing work and school requires planning and prioritization, skills that are crucial in adult life. Managing schedules, meeting deadlines, and fulfilling job responsibilities contribute to personal development. For instance, a student who works part-time in a retail store learns to juggle assignments, shifts, and personal commitments, preparing them for the demands of higher education or future employment.Moreover, working while studying allows teenagers to gain practical experience that can enhance their resumes. In a competitive job market, having work experience, even if it is part-time, can set them apart from their peers upon graduation. Students can cultivate essential soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. Such experience can also help them identify their interests and career paths early on, making them more informed decisions about their education.Additionally, earning their own money can instill a sense of financial literacy in young individuals. Handling income, expenses, and savings teaches them how to budget, make financial decisions, and understand the value of hard work. Financial independence can relieve some of the pressures of student life, enabling them to contribute towards their education or pursue extracurricular activities without relying solely on parental support.In conclusion, while there are potential drawbacks to teenagers working while in school—such as time constraints that could interfere with academic performance—the advantages of developing work ethic, responsibility, and financial acumen far outweigh the negatives. Therefore, I firmly believe that part-time jobs can be a positive and enriching experience for students.
298;Many people have learned a foreign language in their own country, others have learned a foreign language in the country in which it is spoken. Which is better? Given advantages of each and support your viewpoint.;Our World has varied cultures and each culture has its own language. It has become essential for a person to learn at least one foreign language as one do interacts with foreigners once in a lifetime and learning a foreign langauge adds on to a person skill-set as well. Also, I think its better that people learn foreign language in their own country. The reasons for holding that opinion are illustrated in the subsequent paragraphs.First of all, it is not possible for everyone to visit a foreign country to learn a foreign language as it requires large amount of money and legal formalities. In the earlier periods, it was not easy to find a teacher to learn a foreign languge. But with the advent of globalization, one can easily find a teacher in their own country. For example, in Indian sub-continent there are large number of centers opened for getting trained in variety of languages like french, german etc.Second, colleges and universities have introduced foreign language course as a part of their curriculum. Students can choose any language from the set of languages available at a university. So, it is very easy to learn a foreign in our own country. Also, highly qualified foreign language teachers are easily accessible in various schools and colleges.Third, technology has also played a great role in reducing the separation between learning a foreign languge in our own country. A large number of foreign language courses are available online and there are various forums where people can discuss their problems on different foreign languages.To sum up, it is better for people to learn a foreign language in their own country. It is cost effective and there is a pool of opportunities available now to accomplish the same.;The debate over whether to learn a foreign language in one's own country or in a country where the language is natively spoken has been a topic of discussion among language learners for years. Each method presents its own set of advantages and disadvantages, which can significantly impact the language acquisition process.Learning a foreign language in one's own country often provides access to structured courses and qualified teachers who can guide learners through the complexities of grammar, pronunciation, and vocabulary. This approach allows for a more controlled environment where individuals can progress at their own pace. Additionally, learners often benefit from culturally adapted materials that align with their own backgrounds, facilitating comprehension. Language schools and community colleges offer ample resources, making this option accessible to many.On the other hand, immersing oneself in a country where the language is spoken presents a unique opportunity for real-life application and cultural integration. Immersion facilitates language acquisition exponentially, allowing learners to engage in day-to-day conversations, pick up colloquialisms, and practice listening to native speakers. The necessity of communicating in real-world scenarios can significantly boost confidence and fluency, which formal classroom settings may not replicate. Furthermore, cultural immersion fosters a deeper understanding of the language's nuances and the lifestyle surrounding it.In my view, although learning a language in one's own country is beneficial for foundational skills, the immersive experience of learning a language abroad is ultimately more effective for fostering fluency and cultural understanding. The practical advantages of engaging directly with native speakers and adapting to life within a new culture outweigh the structured learning approach. For those who have the opportunity, studying abroad can enrich both language skills and personal growth, making it a more comprehensive language-learning experience.
299;Some people believe that students should be given one long vocation each year. Other believe that students should have several short vacations throughout the year. Which viewpoint do you agree with? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Everybody require some break from their tight schedules likewise students also require vacation form their intense academic schedules. Many people promote one long vacation system of the school because it would help student to start their course or academic year with strong zeal of learning. So other several, prefer numbers of short breaks during the year so that student can get rejuvenate periodically. In both the scenario students relief themselves. However, i discern that several small breaks will help students to be active in their academics.Firstly, several vacations throughout the year will keep stress level of students low. Many educational bodies schedule its small vacations after term exams so that student's get relief form exam pressure. However, research done by universities proves that student's performance improves if they get regular breaks from their learning, preparation and examination schedule. Many colleges in foreign countries provide vacations to students after each semester that facilitate student to entertain themselves as well as prepare for their next semester. Also several holidays aid these students to not only amuse themselves but also arrange fund and materials such as books and references material for their upcoming course.Secondly, scientific research provide several authentic survey of the students' performance after break. It states that students learning capability increase after having refreshing vacation. To quote an instance, in my school we used to get several vacations after our quarterly exams. During those vacations i used to analyze my performance in latest examination and used to go through those question or concept again to avoid making same mistakes. I also used to spend my time on developing some recreational activity or learning some sports or game. During my all vacations, I used to miss my school due to which I used to restart my session with great enthusiasm of learning and scoring good marks in new quarter.Vacations are not only required by students but also by professionals and housekeepers. As it not only provide break to them from their regular commitment but also allows them to spend some time on themselves, heel stressful mind and boost desire of resuming to the regular schedule. Therefore schools should consider giving several small vocations to the students during the year.;"The debate over the optimal structure of school vacations for students has prompted varying opinions. Some argue that students should have one long vacation each year, while others believe that multiple short vacations are more beneficial. I firmly support the idea that students should have several short vacations throughout the year, as this approach can enhance learning, mitigate burnout, and provide timely opportunities for recreational experiences.Firstly, multiple short vacations offer students regular breaks that help prevent academic burnout. Continuous exposure to schoolwork without significant rest can lead to fatigue and decreased motivation. Short vacations can serve as essential mental health breaks, allowing students to recharge and return to their studies with renewed focus and enthusiasm. For instance, after a demanding term, a week-long break gives students the chance to refresh their minds, thus improving their productivity and engagement upon returning to the classroom.Moreover, having short vacations spread throughout the academic year allows for flexibility in learning. Students can plan their study schedules around these breaks, which can reduce the overwhelming pressure that often accompanies long periods of continuous study. For example, during a series of shorter breaks, students might engage in refreshing outdoor activities, pursue hobbies, or catch up on personal interests, which contributes to a more well-rounded educational experience.Finally, short vacations facilitate opportunities for families to spend quality time together throughout the year. Many families may find it challenging to coordinate travel plans around a single long vacation; instead, shorter breaks allow for various family activities and bonding experiences.In conclusion, while a long vacation may seem appealing, several short vacations offer significant advantages in terms of mental well-being, educational flexibility, and family interaction. This structure better suits the diverse needs of students in today’s fast-paced educational environment."
300;"The expression ""Never, never give up"" means to keep trying and never stop working for your goals. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Use specific reasons and examples to support your reasons.";"""Keep running!,"" shouted from my heart but my legs can hardly move. During running for 20 Kilometers in a marathon running tournament 2014, I saw some people stopped running while the others fought until their last minute. At some moment, my body was telling me to stop but the choice that I made was on the contrary. I did not stop and won a medal goals in my life at the age of nearly thirty. From this experience, I believe that a person should keep trying for his goals. Firstly, committing to our goal helps creating personal worth. For example, I realized the true potential of my body and mind as I decided to train myself hard. Even if I were not to win this medal, I acknowledged the great amount of my endeavor as I could keep my tired legs running. Secondly, one who learns the great difficulty will become stronger. I remembered how I was suffered in the first round when I was last person who touched the line. However, I did not give up, and believed that I would be better in the next round because I knew how to improve myself. I had been a loser for a thousand time before the first winning, and suffering from losing in each competition makes me stronger. Thirdly, at some point, we, as an average people, might feel that the responsibility to our goal is too heavy to carry on. I believe that the responsibility is worthy of carrying. When the distance is longer and harder to achieve, a runner who can go beyond his limit will proud of himself. He can feel the sweetness of triumph because he did not stop pursing his goal. For these reasons, I agree that one should not give up, as the true reward is to have the dignity. Anyone who wants to achieve the goal should acknowledge that his effort and experience from suffering helps him understand his true potential and increase his strength, and ultimately, it will prompt him to be ready for overcoming the greater challenge in his life.";"The expression ""Never, never give up"" embodies a powerful ethos that encourages perseverance and resilience in the face of adversity. I wholeheartedly agree with this statement, as it reflects an essential truth about the pursuit of goals and personal ambitions.Firstly, persistence is often the key differentiator between success and failure. Many notable figures, such as Thomas Edison and J.K. Rowling, exemplify this principle. Edison famously stated, “I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work,” highlighting his relentless pursuit of innovation despite countless setbacks. His determination ultimately led to the invention of the light bulb, which transformed the world. Similarly, Rowling faced numerous rejections before finally publishing the Harry Potter series, now a global phenomenon. Their journeys illustrate that unwavering dedication often leads to extraordinary achievements.In addition, the process of striving for a goal teaches valuable life lessons. When individuals confront obstacles, they cultivate attributes such as resilience, adaptability, and problem-solving skills. For instance, a student struggling to master a challenging subject may initially feel discouraged. However, through perseverance—attending extra tutoring sessions or dedicating additional study hours—the student not only acquires knowledge but also builds confidence and tenacity. These qualities are invaluable, equipping individuals to handle future challenges, both professionally and personally.However, it is important to note that “never giving up” does not imply blindly pursuing unfruitful paths. Sometimes, it is necessary to reassess goals, adapt strategies, or shift focus. Nevertheless, the core message remains: persistence is crucial. In conclusion, the maxim “never, never give up” serves as a powerful reminder that dedication and resilience are integral to realizing one’s dreams. Embracing this philosophy can undoubtedly lead to personal growth and the eventual fulfillment of one’s aspirations."
301;Is it better to enjoy your money when you earn it or is it better to save your money for some time in the future? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;In recent years the majority of developed countries have a low saving rate because the people opt to spend their earnings immediately or they even take loans to finance their expenses. But isn't it better to save your money for later investments or rough times? Im my opinion, saving some part of your earnings is essential due to the fact that you can not predict future developments, neither in your professional nor your personal life, furthermore with savings you can fulfill some of your dreams.First, there are several uncertainties about your professional future. The global economic conditions in these days are tough and there are many unpredictable factors that make it necessary to have some money on your bank account. As example I remember some friends who lost their jobs recently due to the economic crisis in Europe. Some of them had no own savings. They could not afford the rent, so they had to move back in with their families and they lost their independence.In addition, you can not be sure about the development in your personal life. It is possible that in the future you have some unavoidable expenses that you could not afford without savings. Back in university I remember a friend of mine who had just little savings and he had to deal with a major repair of his car. He could not afford the maintenance so he had to sell it. Finally, with savings you can afford some luxurious goods and fulfill your dreams. Working hard and saving money for later on investments is a great way of getting a satisfying feeling and to reward yourself for something you have accomplished. For instance, I made a month-long backpack trip through Southeast Asia last summer with my girlfriend. Without our savings we could not have pursued our long-time dream.Considering all the above mentioned arguments, from my point of view there is no other choice than saving money for some time.;"The debate over whether to enjoy money when earned or to save it for future use has been a topic of discussion for many. Both perspectives offer valid points, but I believe that a balanced approach is the most prudent. Enjoying money today can enhance quality of life, while saving can provide security and peace of mind for the future.On one hand, spending money when you earn it can lead to immediate gratification and a fulfilling lifestyle. Experiences such as traveling, dining out, or engaging in hobbies can enrich one's life dramatically. For instance, a person who chooses to spend part of their earnings on travel might create memories that last a lifetime, enriching their perspective and understanding of different cultures. These experiences can also foster personal growth, allowing individuals to appreciate the world around them. Additionally, enjoying money can promote well-being; studies have shown that spending on experiences rather than material possessions yields greater happiness. However, the value of saving money cannot be understated. Saving not only prepares individuals for emergencies and unforeseen circumstances, but it also provides a safety net that can lead to greater financial freedom in the long run. For example, those who invest in retirement accounts early can benefit from compound interest, ensuring a comfortable lifestyle later in life. Furthermore, saving money can alleviate stress associated with financial insecurity, empowering individuals to make choices regarding their careers and lifestyles without the burden of debt.In conclusion, while there are undeniable benefits to both enjoying and saving money, the key lies in finding a balance. Enjoying the fruits of one’s labor contributes to a fulfilling life, but prudent saving lays the groundwork for future security. By striking this balance, individuals can enjoy life today while also preparing for tomorrow."
302;Some people are always in a hurry to go places and get things done. Other people prefer to take their time and live life at a slower pace. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Modern technologies and globalization have increased the speed of life in the past decades tremendously. However, while the majority of people live on the fast lane, others decide to reduce the speed and take their time. To draw an entire picture, we have to consider both the advantages and disadvantages of this increased speed of life and ask our self which way of life is better. In my opinion, it is very important to live life at a slower pace, because living in a hurry comes along with several disadvantages.First, living your life on the fast lane is very stressful and can affect your health. If you are always hurried and you do not take a certain time off, your body will react to your stressful lifestyle. Many hardworking people have diseases, like the burn-out syndrome, because their bodies cannot hold the pace. For instance, my father had a a breakdown several years ago due to his stressful job. After several weeks off his body was restored, now he has reduced the tempo of his lifestyle and is doing fine.In addition, living your life at a slower pace increases your happiness. If you are always facing excessive stress you cannot care for your beloved's. If you do not hurry yourself you can take more time for your family and friends. Caring for your social environment will increase your happiness and also reduce your stress level. For example, a friend of mine lives at a slow pace and is really satisfied about it, because he can enjoy his family and cultivate his friendships.Finally, quality takes time. When you are faced with difficult tasks and you do them in a rush, you are more likely to do avoidable errors or mistakes. Doing tasks in a hurry may end up in not considering all necessary aspects or opportunities. As a result you might make mistakes, you would not have done with more patience. To illustrate, I once wrote an essay in a hurry and got a bad grade, because I made few mistakes I could have avoided.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, living a slower life is advantageous for your health, your happiness and even the quality of your work.;In our fast-paced modern world, the choice between rushing through life or embracing a more leisurely pace is often a reflection of one’s personal values and lifestyle preferences. Personally, I prefer to take my time and savor life at a slower pace for several reasons, including enhanced well-being, deeper connections with others, and a greater appreciation for experiences.Firstly, living at a slower pace contributes significantly to my overall well-being. The constant hustle and bustle of life can lead to stress and burnout, diminishing both mental and physical health. By taking the time to slow down, I can prioritize self-care, engage in mindfulness practices, and focus on activities that bring me joy. For instance, I enjoy meditating and going for long walks in nature, which allow me to recharge and reflect. This balance fosters a sense of calm and promotes a healthier lifestyle that rushing often undermines.Moreover, a slower approach allows me to forge deeper connections with the people around me. When I take the time to engage in conversations and activities, I can fully immerse myself in those moments. This presence cultivates meaningful relationships and ensures that my interactions are genuine. For example, I cherish weekends spent with family, where we can play games, enjoy long meals, and share stories without the pressure of a ticking clock.Finally, living slowly fosters a greater appreciation for life’s moments. When I’m not racing to the next task, I can notice the beauty in simple things—a sunset, the laughter of friends, or the aroma of a home-cooked meal. This gratitude enriches my experiences, making each moment feel significant.In conclusion, while some thrive in the quick pace of modern life, I find solace and fulfillment in taking my time. By prioritizing well-being, nurturing relationships, and appreciating the beauty in everyday moments, I cultivate a more rewarding and meaningful existence.
303;Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree with this point of view? Why or why not? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer;In the past centuries the population steadily grew and now, for the first time in history, is exceeding seven billion. As a result more and more natural environment had to be vanished to make room for housing, feeding and industry. But isn't it important to preserve the land to maintain the other species living on our planet? In my opinion, we clearly have to change our attitude towards the environment because of several reasons.First, the natural diversity is very important for further generations. If we don't change our behavior we will extinct many species living for millions of years on the planet. As we destroy the natural habitat, like forests, jungles and lakes, to make place for our industry and farmland, we rob the ecosystem. To illustrate, every day a massive part of the Rainforest in South America is destroyed to provide wood and farmland. If we don't preserve this important part of our ecosystem many endangered animals will loose their natural habitat and go extinct. As a result, further generations will never have the opportunity to see and study these animals.In addition, a stable and sustainable environment is essential for the weather. Our behavior causes pollution, which heavily affects the weather conditions on planet Earth and causes the undoubtedly Global Warming. This not only affects the endangered animals, but also the humans because we are affected by the increasing sea level and the climatic changes. For example, recent studies from the United Nations Organization have shown that, till 2050 the sea level will increase over one meter in the average. This will dramaticly affect all people living near the coast and change the global climate.In conclusion, there is to say that, given the arguments above, we definitely have to change our behavior towards the environment, not only to preserve the endangered animals but also to preserve our own living conditions.;The debate over prioritizing human needs for farmland, housing, and industry versus the necessity for conserving land for endangered animals is complex and multifaceted. While it is undeniable that human development is crucial for societal advancement and economic prosperity, I argue that safeguarding the habitats of endangered species is equally important and should not be sacrificed for human expansion.Firstly, biodiversity is essential for the resilience of ecosystems. Endangered species often play critical roles within their habitats, contributing to ecological balance. For instance, the decline of pollinators like bees can have dire consequences for agriculture and food production. Therefore, conserving land for these species not only supports their survival but indirectly secures our own food sources. If we continue to prioritize short-term human needs without consideration for the natural world, we risk creating a cycle of environmental degradation that ultimately undermines our own well-being.Moreover, the loss of biodiversity can lead to a decreased quality of life for future generations. Green spaces and wildlife contribute to essential ecosystem services such as clean air and water, which are necessary for human health and survival. The economic models that prioritize development over conservation often overlook these long-term benefits and can thus be seen as short-sighted. Investment in sustainable practices, such as eco-friendly agriculture, can meet human needs while preserving the ecological balance.Additionally, protecting endangered species can foster tourism and recreation that bolster local economies. Many communities thrive on ecotourism, showcasing their unique wildlife and natural landscapes. This can provide income while fostering a greater appreciation for nature, ultimately leading to more support for conservation efforts.In conclusion, while human needs are imperative, they should not overshadow the importance of preserving land for endangered animals. A holistic approach that embraces sustainable development can ensure that both human and environmental needs are met, ultimately leading to a healthier planet for all inhabitants.
304;Some people believe that university students should be required to attend classes. Others believe that going to classes should be optional for students. Which point of view do you agree with? Use specific reasons and details to explain your answer.Ê;University students have different opinion about their attendance to class. Some students believe that they should be required to attend classes while others believe that it is an optional for the students. According to my opinion, because it is university level of education, students have enough maturity to choose their choice. Therefore, I strongly agree that going to classes should be optional for the students.To begin with, going to classes are sometimes waste of the time. For instance, some lecturers in our university read the same text in the reference books for that particular course module. Further, they didn't explain the contents in order to understand by the students. It was waste of the time. Because the university students have grown up, they have enough ability to read and understand the text book. Moreover, with the modern technology, students can collect more information from different sources. For example, from the Internet, students can read many articles and e-books and can watch video tutorials which provide the information more apparently. However, some lecturers deliver lectures very informative and interesting way. When the students attend that lectures, they can obviously feel that it was very useful and they did not waste their time.Additionally, mostly university has taken whole day for the lectures. Besides, most of the university students are working students in order to manage the expenses during the education time. Students need to work as part time basis. Hence, they have to schedule the lectures time, studying time and working time. At the same time, rather than attending any boring lecturers, students can participate to other activities such as debate competition, swimming meet, Basketball and so forth. From that they can meet other university students and build up the relationships with them. In a nutshell, although few brilliant lecturers deliver more informative lectures, some are boring the students in the class and wasting the students' time. When the students go to university, they have matured mentally and physically. They have enough knowledge to choose what they need to do. Therefore, to make use of time, if the students choose the classes as optional, it would provide more benefits than drawbacks.;"The debate surrounding whether university students should be required to attend classes or have the freedom to choose is a contentious one. While both sides present compelling arguments, I believe that attendance should be mandatory for several important reasons.Firstly, attending classes fosters a structured learning environment. Universities provide a unique opportunity for students to engage directly with professors and peers, allowing for a rich exchange of ideas and perspectives. This face-to-face interaction enhances understanding and retention of material, as discussions often delve deeper than textbooks can provide. Additionally, regular attendance helps students develop discipline and time management skills, essential attributes for both academic success and professional life.Furthermore, the social aspect of attending classes cannot be overlooked. University is not solely an academic experience; it is also a time for personal growth and networking. Students who attend classes are more likely to build relationships with their peers and professors, creating a supportive community that can lead to collaborations and friendships. These connections can serve as invaluable resources in their future careers, providing networking opportunities and references that might not be available to those who choose to isolate themselves.On the other hand, proponents of optional attendance argue that it encourages personal responsibility and self-motivation. While this can be true, it can also lead to detrimental habits. Some students may struggle with time management and prioritize leisure over academics if they are not required to attend. This disengagement can significantly impact their academic performance and overall university experience.In conclusion, while the idea of optional attendance may appeal to the value of personal freedom, the benefits of mandatory class attendance—structured learning, social engagement, and the development of essential skills—outweigh the arguments for allowing students to skip classes. Ensuring attendance fosters a more enriched and comprehensive educational experience."
305;Technology makes people's lives simpler rather than makes people's lives more complicated.;Believe it or not, nowadays people are always confronted with a problem that whether technology makes their life simpler or not, thus making them confused. Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier. Although I conceded technology may make people's life complicated in some aspects, the convenience it brings is more. In what follows, I will illustrate my point of view.First, when it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler. With a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle. Alternatively, if you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times.Second, technology also makes teaching simpler. In the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers. With the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards, it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once.Admittedly, to some extent, technology may make people's life more complicated. For example, the cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications. For instance, folks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them. In addition, games on their phone exert a tremendous fascination on teenagers, leading to a large problem that they got addicted to their phones. Consequently, making their life more complicated and tired. Based on the factors I have mentioned above, a conclusion can be drawn that although technology may make people's life complicated in some cases, the convenience it brings in people's are significant.;Technology has undeniably transformed the fabric of our daily existence, making lives simpler in numerous ways. By automating mundane tasks, enhancing accessibility, and fostering communication, technology has streamlined our routines, allowing us to focus on what truly matters.One of the most significant advantages of technology is automation. Automated systems in various industries have increased productivity and efficiency, reducing the burden of manual labor. For example, appliances such as washing machines and dishwashers have significantly cut down the time spent on household chores. In addition, applications and software can now manage finances, schedule appointments, and even shop for groceries, allowing people to dedicate more time to leisure activities and personal development.Furthermore, technology has dramatically improved accessibility to information and services. The internet serves as a vast repository of knowledge, making it possible for individuals to learn new skills, explore diverse cultures, or even seek online medical advice from the comfort of their homes. Telemedicine platforms allow patients to consult healthcare professionals without the hassle of travel, thereby simplifying the process of receiving medical care. Such innovations have not only saved time but have also made essential services available to a wider audience, regardless of geographical barriers.Communication has also been revolutionized by technology. The advent of smartphones and social media has transformed how people connect, enabling instant communication across vast distances. Families and friends can share updates in real-time, helping maintain relationships that might otherwise be strained by distance. Moreover, remote working tools have facilitated flexible working arrangements, allowing for a better work-life balance.In conclusion, technology serves as a catalyst for simplifying modern life rather than complicating it. Through automation, improved accessibility to information, and enhanced communication, digital advancements empower individuals, providing them with the tools they need to navigate daily challenges with ease. Ultimately, embracing technology can lead to a more organized and fulfilling existence.
306;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Television, newspapers, magazines and other media pay to much attention to the personal lives of famous people such as public figures and celebrities. Use specific reasons and details to explain your opinion.;"Some people think that mass media should only focus on news and current affairs. Others believe that television, newspapers and magazines should keep us entertained and therefore they should pay attention to famous people lives as well. This issue is a controversial one, but in my opinion a closer examination reveals that mass media deal too much with superficial things for different reasons. One reason is that television and newspapers focus on famous peoples' lives in order to increase their audience or readership. Gutter press and Tabloid TV are more and more replacing quality papers or documentaries programs. Thanks to the Internet, we can go online and have access to information from all over the world and therefore mass media don't need any more to keep informed people but their goal is to have enough readers or TV audience. Another reason is that we live in a society where the most important thing is appearance and gossip. Nowadays, unscrupulous paparazzi constantly follow celebrities just to take a photo while they are eating or training. Newspapers often receive accusations of checkbook journalism; this means that magazines pay people a lot of money for stories or photos. Additionally, there are Reality TV, television programs in which people are put into artificial environments and situations, for example like ""Big Brother"".To sum up, it is clear that television, magazines and newspapers pay too much attention of peoples' private lives for all the reasons mentioned above, namely to increase audience or readership and to give exciting and shocking news to a society which feed upon gutter press and Tabloid TV.";In the contemporary landscape of media consumption, the excessive focus on the personal lives of celebrities and public figures raises significant concerns. I firmly disagree with the notion that this attention is warranted or beneficial. This frenzy around the private lives of the famous not only detracts from more pressing global issues but also cultivates a skewed perception of reality among the general public.Firstly, the media’s preoccupation with celebrity gossip and scandals diverts attention from critical issues that require coverage. Socio-political matters, climate change, and economic instability are often overshadowed by the trivial details of a celebrity's relationship or fashion choices. For instance, during major events like elections or natural disasters, media outlets frequently prioritize sensational stories about public figures over essential news that informs and educates citizens. This imbalance cultivates a society that is ill-informed about significant crises while being excessively aware of the minutiae of celebrity culture.Moreover, the incessant scrutiny of celebrity lives can foster unrealistic standards and expectations among the public. The portrayal of a glamorous lifestyle, often curated through filters and sensational headlines, can lead individuals to develop an unhealthy obsession with perfection. This phenomenon has particularly adverse effects on younger audiences, who are impressionable and might internalize these unrealistic portrayals as benchmarks for their own lives. The emphasis on superficial accomplishments, beauty, and wealth overshadows the value of intellect, hard work, and character.In conclusion, I strongly believe that the media dedicates far too much attention to the personal lives of celebrities. Not only does this tendency distract from more essential global issues, but it also propagates a superficial understanding of success and personal worth among audiences. A more balanced approach to media coverage could promote a healthier, more informed society, prioritizing substantive content over sensationalism.
307;Which do you prefer: staying in one place or moving in search of another place?;Some people may prefer to live in different places at different time because of many reasons such as looking for better job, house, community and so on. I prefer to spend my entire live in one place which is my hometown. In my hometown, I have a lot of friends and good relationships, I love the traffic in here, and the environment is wonderful.I was born and grew up in here, a small town. In here, I have a lot of friends, and we usually spend free time to play sports like soccer, basketball and of course we have a lot of fun. Every people in my town have known each others, and we have good relationships. If anyone needs help, his neighbor will help as much as possible. Nowhere else can give me some people like in here.I want to live here because I love the traffic system in here. We have large streets but few cars, so we can move easily to anywhere. Last week, I went to the city center to meet my friends. The traffic in the city was too crowed. I have to wait for an hour to go to my friend house.I also love the environment in here. I have been gone to some places to travel and stay for a short time, and I realize that the environment in some place isn't clean and fresh like my home town. There were a lot of people so the environment can't be keep clean.In conclusion, I strongly feel that staying in one place is better than moving number of places. Moving some places can give to you a lot of experiences but living in one place like your hometown can make you feel comfortable about the traffic, people and of course the environment.;The choice between staying in one place and moving in search of another has been a topic of contemplation for many. Both lifestyles have their merits, and the decision often comes down to personality, life circumstances, and personal aspirations. Personally, I lean toward the idea of moving in search of new places, and here's why.Firstly, the act of moving opens up a world of opportunities and experiences. Traveling to new locations allows for the exploration of diverse cultures, cuisines, and ways of life. Each place boasts unique histories and traditions that enrich our understanding of the world. This exposure fosters adaptability and broader perspectives, qualities that are invaluable in today’s interconnected society. For instance, encountering different social norms can challenge and expand one’s worldview, promoting personal growth and empathy toward others.Additionally, moving can lead to a renewed sense of purpose and excitement. The prospect of a fresh start in a new environment can be invigorating. It creates an atmosphere of potential and discovery. This dynamic aspect of life fuels creativity and stimulates the mind, often leading to personal breakthroughs that might not occur in a static situation. On the other hand, staying in one place offers stability and a sense of belonging that cannot be overlooked. Deep connections with friends, family, and community are essential for mental well-being. However, I argue that one can also forge meaningful connections in new places. The transient nature of moving can lead to diverse relationships that might be equally rewarding.In conclusion, while both staying in one place and moving have their strengths, the thrill of exploration and the opportunities for growth that come with seeking new locales is what ultimately captivates me. The journey toward new experiences not only shapes us but also enriches the tapestry of our lives.
308;Students at universities often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community. Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community. Where would you prefer to live? Give reasons for your preference.Ê;When it comes to the issue of choosing an accommodation after completion of their high school, most students always get confused between these two options: living in an apartment, or in university dormitories. As far as I am concerned, both choices have their own advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, living in a dormitory helps students to familiarize themselves with the academic environment of the university. For instance, students can have an opportunity to take part in many kind of extracurricular activities happing around the campus such as attending conversation club, or joining sports club. Students can also have more chance of interaction with their teachers and classmates. In addition, it is easier for students to get help when facing problem such as if students have problem in solving their math question, they can easily ask for help to their roommates, classmates, or teachers. I think living in dormitory is always helpful to students. On the other hand, living off campus prepares students for the real life. For example, students can learn many new things such as how to become responsible, independent, punctual, co-operative compared to living in university dormitories. They are responsible to take care of everything including paying their apartment rent on time, and dealing with the utility bills. In addition, students also have to focus on their study, and try to maintain their grades higher. Furthermore, students also have a chance to know about the community around them. Interacting with the people, and socializing with them prepares students for the life after graduation. From given the evidences, it seems to me that it becomes hard for students to choose between their living options since both living accommodation have its own benefits. If I have to choose, I would definitely choose the second option: living in an apartment. I think that it teaches me everything that I certainly wants to learn in my life because learning all those characteristics would really help me in leading successful life.;When attending university, one of the critical decisions students face is where to live. Two primary options are university dormitories and community apartments, each offering distinct advantages. Understanding these differences can help students make informed choices about their living situations.Living in university dormitories provides unique benefits. Firstly, dormitories are usually located close to campus, allowing for easy access to classes, libraries, and extracurricular activities. This convenience can save students time and energy, thereby enhancing their academic experience. Additionally, dorm life fosters a strong sense of community. Students have numerous opportunities for social interaction, making it easier to forge friendships and engage in group activities. The environment is generally supportive, with resident advisors available to help manage conflicts or concerns. Moreover, dormitories often include meals, laundry facilities, and utilities as part of the housing package, simplifying daily logistics for students.On the other hand, living in community apartments offers independence and flexibility, which can be especially appealing for students looking to transition into adult life. Apartments often provide more space and privacy than dormitories, allowing residents to personalize their living environment. Furthermore, students can choose their roommates or even opt for living alone, catering to individual preferences. Community living may also afford students the opportunity to explore diverse neighborhoods and local culture, enriching their university experience beyond campus life.Personally, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community. The autonomy it offers aligns better with my lifestyle and aspirations for independence. I believe that managing my own space and responsibilities would allow me to develop vital life skills. Additionally, the chance to immerse myself in the local community, engage with various cultures, and build a wider social network is important to me. Overall, while both options have their merits, the advantages of living in a community apartment resonate more with my personal goals.
309;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct.;Organizations, these days, seek to find people who can work extraordinary fast and carefully. These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company. Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal mentioned before. I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons. Trying to learn skills, working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice.To begin with, if persons work rapidly, they will have more chance to study. Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter. If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying, they can stares in their workplace. For example, I have a friend who was working so slowly. He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him. My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working.Most importantly, people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased. If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money. This fact pushes them to work faster and faster. For example, because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money, I am working in two organization to gain more salary. The more money, the more chances.Last but not least, people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks. If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly, your boss will assign you more tasks. If you do them fast too, the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder. It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation. Even if we ignore this result, by the same token, you can get higher position and more money.To sum up, I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky. Gaining more skills by study, having more than one job, and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages. I hope people gain this skill because after that they will endorse my choice.;In today's fast-paced world, the debate between speed and accuracy in the workplace is more pertinent than ever. I firmly agree with the statement that it is often more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and ensure absolute correctness. This perspective stems from the nature of modern demand, technological advancements, and the importance of adaptability in a dynamic environment.Firstly, the rapid evolution of technology has changed the landscape of work. Businesses must respond to consumer needs and market trends almost instantaneously to remain competitive. For instance, in the realm of software development, companies that can launch updates or new products quickly often capture greater market share, even if initial iterations have minor flaws. These flaws can be addressed in subsequent releases. Therefore, the ability to prioritize speed enables organizations to innovate and adapt continuously.Secondly, working quickly fosters a culture of experimentation and learning. In many creative fields, taking risks and making mistakes is essential for growth. Quick iterations allow teams to test ideas, learn from their errors, and refine their approach, leading to improved outcomes over time. Notably, companies like Google and Amazon are renowned for their “fail-fast” mentality, where employees are encouraged to launch ideas quickly without fear of failure.However, it is crucial to note that speed should not come at the expense of quality. A balanced approach is vital, wherein workers are empowered to prioritize speed while also developing mechanisms for quick error correction. This duality promotes an efficient work environment while ensuring that the core standards of practice are upheld.In conclusion, while accuracy is undeniably important, the pressures of modern society and the benefits of an agile work culture suggest that, at times, working quickly—even with the risk of mistakes—can lead to greater innovation and success.
310;Do you agree or disagree: It is not necessary for university students to attend classes as long as they can pass the exam.;Though out the last decade, the load of the university students has been constantly increasing. There are those who consider that university students cannot attend any classes until the students pass the exam. There are those who said that student can attend the university coarse without passing the exam. However, from my perspective, students can acquire university knowledge without the prerequisite of passing exam. The reasons to be illustrated are follows. Firstly, the students are not constantly expert in every part of a subject. For example, I love Physics. But I don't like electronics, because electronics cannot always be seen in the real world. And I have had 0 in physics score when I study the electronics. But I constantly achieve 100 score when I study other part of the physics. And if I cannot attend the classes until I pass the exam of electronics, I could not pass the entire part of physics, and I will fail the exam over and over again. Luckily, in our university, you can attend the classes regardless of the score you reach. And I can study physics without consideration of my electronics. And at last, I took the electronics again and pass the exam.Secondly, if the university take the policy that no one can attend the classes without passing exam, students are highly likely to leave uncultivated. If one fail most of the exam, it means that he or she cannot participate in most of the classes. And the students will have nothing to do in the campus. Then he or she will play online games days and nights. The academic achievement will decline. In the end, this student will become a loser in the world. And all this is due to that the university don't permit them to attend the class. This is not the failure of the university but also the entire education system.Admittedly, the university student may don't reach a high if the university allow student to participate in the class no matter whether they pass the test or not. But the benefit of free to access to the classes eclipse the issue of lower points.All in all, the university should allow the student to participate in the classed without passing the test because not only is every students expert in every part of one subject but also it will reduce the student in the campus who leave uncultivated.;"In the debate over whether university students need to attend classes if they can pass their exams, I firmly disagree with the notion that attendance is unnecessary. While the ability to succeed academically through exams indicates a level of understanding, the benefits of attending classes extend far beyond mere grades.First and foremost, classroom learning fosters an environment of interaction and engagement. In-person classes promote discussions, which stimulate critical thinking and encourage students to delve deeper into the subject matter. This interactive environment can lead to a more comprehensive understanding that is often absent in self-study or online formats. Many educators employ various pedagogical techniques that enhance learning, such as group projects, debates, and presentations, which are difficult to replicate outside of a classroom setting.Moreover, attending classes allows students to build valuable relationships with peers and professors. These connections can be crucial for networking, mentorship, and collaborative opportunities. Engaging with faculty during office hours can provide insights and guidance that go beyond the curriculum, enriching the educational experience.Additionally, regular attendance instills discipline and time management skills. The structure of attending scheduled classes helps students develop routines and habits essential for success in any future profession. This discipline is often a predictor of long-term academic and career success, aspects that passing an exam alone may not sufficiently address.Lastly, the university experience encompasses more than just academic knowledge; it is also about personal growth and social development. By attending classes, students participate in a broader community and are exposed to diverse perspectives, which is vital for preparing them for the complexities of the real world.In conclusion, while passing exams is an important measure of academic success, it is not the sole indicator of a fulfilling and enriching university experience. Classroom attendance contributes significantly to intellectual, social, and personal development, making it essential for students in their pursuit of higher education."
311;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? To improve the quality of education, universities should spend more money in salaries for university professors.  Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;University education is always an important part of one's life. That's why education in university is discussed all the time. What is the best way to orientate the students? Raising the salaries of professors so? I would say no. The professors are essential, however, the schools are established for students. Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors. The following are my opinions. To begin with, the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors. I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively. By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment. A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer. Thus, students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning. That is to say, students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve. Thus, the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation. In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby. For me, I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment. It's unpleasant to stay at school. However, coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly.Besides, the ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better. To improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate. In addition, will the university filter all the professors overall? Some professors don't deserve the money at all, then, what's the point to spend money on them? High-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money. There won't be any effect if school does so. There was news about raising professors' salary in my country. This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly. The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries. As you can see, if the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen. At school, students are priority. Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university. That's the main reason I against providing more money to professors. Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition.;The quality of education in universities is a multifaceted issue influenced by various factors, one of which is the remuneration of professors. I strongly agree that universities should allocate more funds to increase salaries for university professors, as this investment can lead to substantial improvements in educational quality.Firstly, higher salaries can attract and retain highly qualified and experienced faculty members. When universities offer competitive compensation packages, they are more likely to secure top talent from the competitive job market. This includes not only professors who are experts in their respective fields but also those with a proven track record of effective teaching and research. For example, institutions like Stanford and Harvard have been able to maintain their prestigious reputations partly due to their ability to attract renowned scholars who bring their expertise and insights to the classroom.Secondly, better salaries can enhance faculty motivation and job satisfaction, resulting in improved teaching outcomes. Professors who feel valued and fairly compensated are more likely to engage deeply with their students, invest time in curriculum development, and pursue innovative teaching methods. This commitment enriches the learning experience, fostering an environment where students can thrive. Studies have shown that motivated educators correlate with better student performance and higher retention rates, creating a cycle of success that benefits the entire university community.Moreover, higher salaries can encourage professors to invest more in research and professional development. This, in turn, can have a cascading effect on students, as faculty members who are engaged in current research can bring fresh insights and cutting-edge knowledge into their classrooms. For instance, a professor actively engaged in their field can provide students with learning experiences that reflect the latest advancements and challenges.In conclusion, increasing salaries for university professors is a pivotal strategy for enhancing the quality of education. By attracting skilled faculty, fostering their motivation, and encouraging ongoing research, universities can create a dynamic educational environment that ultimately benefits students and society as a whole.
312;Pets should be treated like family members. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Pets have always been essential in our society. Cats and dogs are the most common pets but there are birds, tortoises and fishes as well. Some people think that pets should be treated like family members. However, others argue that they are just animals and aren't able to think like us. The issue is controversial but in my opinion, pets should be treated like human beings for different reasons.First, pets are our friends as well as certain human beings are. Similarly to friends, indeed, they are always with us and they are there if we feel alone. We can talk to them because they listen to us, more than some people will ever do. To illustrate this point, I can write about my own experience. When I was 14 years old, my uncle passed away and I felt like everything was no longer important. Talking to my friends was frustrating because none of them have ever felt that way. Since I was all alone at home for a long time, my dog was near me and it seemed to me that only him could understand my deeply feelings. Clearly, although pets aren't able to speak with us, we can nonetheless count on them.Secondly, pets are useful for a variety of things. For example, nowadays the pet therapy is becoming more popular than before. Researchers have discovered that pets can bring benefits in a huge amount of illnesses. There are dogs who lead blind people around the city and therefore without them they could not go around all alone. In addition, pets are important for depressed people as well because their presence make them feel better. Moreover, there are dogs who are educated in order to find out criminals or to use their sense of smell to find drugs. To sum up, I am strongly convinced that pets deserve to be treated like family members because of all the reasons mentioned above, namely they are our friends and they can be useful in many situations.;"The question of whether pets should be treated like family members elicits varied opinions, but I wholeheartedly agree with this statement. Pets, especially dogs and cats, often become integral parts of our lives and households, deserving of love, care, and respect akin to that afforded to human family members.Firstly, the emotional bond between pets and their owners is profound. Pets have an uncanny ability to provide companionship, comfort, and unconditional love. They are often present during moments of joy and sorrow, offering a listening ear or a warm cuddle when needed. Just as family members support each other through life’s ups and downs, pets fulfill a vital role as loyal companions, alleviating feelings of loneliness and anxiety. This emotional connection fosters a sense of belonging and well-being for both the pet and the owner.Moreover, treating pets like family members enhances their quality of life. When owners invest time, resources, and attention into their pets’ welfare, it results in happier and healthier animals. This includes providing regular veterinary care, proper nutrition, mental stimulation, and physical exercise—elements essential for a pet's overall well-being. Family-like treatment ensures that pets are not merely seen as possessions but as sentient beings deserving of respect and care.Additionally, the lessons that pets teach us about empathy, responsibility, and compassion are invaluable. Caring for a pet entails a commitment that mirrors the obligations we hold toward our families. This nurturing relationship can foster a sense of responsibility in children and remind adults of the importance of compassion towards all living beings.In conclusion, treating pets like family members enriches their lives and impacts the emotional health of their human companions. The bonds formed are testament to the fact that love and care extend beyond species boundaries; pets are deserving of our familial affection and attention. Therefore, embracing this philosophy can lead to a more fulfilling life for both pets and their owners."
313;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? In today's world, it is more important to work quickly and risk making mistakes than to work slowly and make sure that everything is correct. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;This current world we situate ourselves in is rather unpredictable, even one sudden invention could bring down all the notions we used bear in mind. Most of us has endeavored to keep up with the pace of the development of today's world in fast pace. I personally believe that even when fast pace may be the wise move to correspond with today's world. However, it might not be the most beneficial move to our society.Primarily, even when the world operates in fast pace, it still requires accuracy. Even simple issues in our daily life like homework require accuracy. If we rush through the work by taking risk of making mistakes, we are actually making zero effort going through our study roughly only for the purpose of fill in before the deadline. In short, it only fulfills the work itself which is rather worthless. It is our capability of work that we should improve rather than holding the belief in completing it. Certainly it may take time to keep up with the others if w need to review our work multiple times, but with consistent work soon enough we'll be able to bring up our speed in completion of work.Secondly, other than the importance of accuracy, the world also seeks efficiency, which concludes both minimum time completion and also criterion of quality. Even when we managed to keep up with the pace by neglecting the details of a project and only aim for a general frame of the project, this will not be something satisfy for the company and clients. We soon will be out of the picture even when we kept up with the pace since when the problem reveals itself we'll have to go back and fix the mistakes we have made. This might be even more costly and time consuming than a neat completion of work at the start. Besides, when looking at this problem within a broader image. Some work cannot tolerate any mistakes at all, for instance, in official missions like the work done by NASA, a tiny mistake can be catastrophic. A miscalculation of the orbit in launching rocket may lead to a failure of the whole project which might worth trillions of dollars. In such circumstances, even when the scientists want to finish off quickly, but they couldn't miss even a single part of the mission since it may trigger loads of problems.To sum up, even when we need to catch up with the pace of the world, it is necessary for us to be extraordinarily cautious since rough work is intolerable when we want to stay competitive.;In today’s fast-paced world, the pressure to deliver results swiftly often leads to the notion that working quickly is more important than ensuring accuracy. While efficiency is indeed crucial, I disagree with the idea that it is more valuable to work hastily and risk mistakes rather than taking the necessary time to ensure correctness.First and foremost, the consequences of mistakes can have significant repercussions, particularly in fields like healthcare, engineering, and finance. For instance, in the medical profession, a rushed diagnosis or treatment plan could jeopardize a patient's health or even their life. Similarly, structural errors in engineering due to a hurried review process can lead to catastrophic failures, illustrating that the cost of errors can far outweigh the benefits of speed. Therefore, prioritizing accuracy over speed can safeguard not only individuals but also organizational integrity.Moreover, the modern workplace often emphasizes quality alongside speed. Companies like Apple and Toyota have demonstrated that a methodical approach can yield innovative products that stand the test of time. Their focus on quality assurance has led to customer loyalty and long-term success, showing that thorough work fosters trust and reliability, both of which are invaluable in business.Additionally, working too quickly can generate a cycle of rework, ultimately leading to inefficiencies. A study by the Lean Enterprise Institute highlighted that organizations spending more time upfront on planning and quality control can save time and resources in the long run. This approach minimizes the need for corrections that arise from hastily made decisions.In conclusion, while working quickly can be advantageous in certain scenarios, it is essential to maintain a balance with quality assurance. The risks associated with making mistakes in a rush highlight the need for careful, deliberate work to ensure accuracy. Therefore, in a world that values rapid results, we should never compromise on the importance of correctness.
314;Some people prefer to live in a small town. Others prefer to live in a big city. Which place would you prefer to live in? Use specific reasons and details to support your answer.;Continuous technological and economical development in modern world created great differences between cities, a difference that is clearly visible in the size of various cities. From cities with more that 20 million people to small towns inhabited by only hundreds of people. This diversities in cities allowed for more difference in people's preferences for where to live. For me, I prefer to live in bigger cities than in small ones, this personal attitude is the result of many factors.First of all, I find the excitement of big cities to be attractive, living in a dynamic environment can turn into a very rich experience that sharpens one's personality and open one's eyes on the real world. Life in big cities cities gives one new challenges every day, let it be deciding which restaurant to go to or deciding which company to work for. For me, this lifestyles is very attractive and is considered a huge advantage of big cities compared with the constant, slow paced life styles of small towns.Another thing that put big cities in front of small towns is the facilitates and services it contains which support and improve the quality of its inhabitants' lives, hospitals, advanced medical facilities can satisfy one's need of medical safety. Cultural events such as exhibitions and theatre plays can enrich one's and widen his horizons, things which aren't offered by small towns.Furthermore, it's undeniable that the economic power of a country is driven by it's big cities and the majority of wealth and finance is centered and controlled in big cities. With this kind of power big cities offer more opportunities for one's career advancements and a more chances of higher income that small towns does, and higher income can be the basis of a happier, healthier life.Finally, although I prefer to live in a big city, I can not help but assure that this is a matter of personal taste, to be clear, I would love to spend some days in countryside to recharge my soul and relieve myself from daily stress.;The debate between living in a small town versus a big city has been ongoing for years, with both lifestyles offering unique benefits and challenges. Personally, I would prefer to live in a small town, and my preference stems from the sense of community, the slower pace of life, and the natural surroundings that small towns typically provide.One of the most appealing aspects of small-town living is the close-knit community. In a small town, people often know their neighbors, creating a supportive environment where everyone looks out for one another. This sense of belonging can foster numerous friendships and a feeling of safety that is sometimes missing in the anonymity of a big city. For example, local gatherings such as farmers' markets, town fairs, or seasonal celebrations allow residents to connect and engage with each other, thereby strengthening community ties.Moreover, small towns tend to have a slower pace of life, which can be refreshing in our fast-paced world. Without the hustle and bustle of city life, residents can enjoy a more relaxed lifestyle that allows them to appreciate their surroundings and spend quality time with loved ones. This can lead to lower stress levels and a greater sense of well-being. For instance, leisurely walks, spontaneous picnics, or simply spending time outdoors can become daily pleasures rather than rare occasions.Additionally, small towns are often surrounded by natural beauty, offering an abundance of outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, and camping. The proximity to nature not only promotes a healthy lifestyle but also provides an escape from the concrete and noise of city living. Being able to enjoy starry nights and fresh air is a luxury that many urban residents do not experience.In conclusion, while big cities may offer convenience and excitement, my preference for small-town living is rooted in the strong sense of community, the relaxed pace of life, and the closeness to nature. These aspects contribute to a fulfilling lifestyle that prioritizes relationships and well-being, thus making small towns an ideal choice for me.
315;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homes.;"The housing shortage is drawing more and more attention nowadays. And the cost of accommodation keeps growing these years. The necessity of governmental financial aid is extremely important. What government should take into consideration at the first place should not be historic and traditional building preservation but new building construction.Building more accommodating constructions meets people's basic need. People cannot live a harmonious life if citizens do not have a decent place to live in. If the price of housing grows continuously, a comfortable place to live in will be a luxury to the middle class and the low class. Then, ordinary people, especially the younger generation, will fall into a certain pattern - work, pay bills for housing, work; and I am sure that it will increase people's dissatisfaction of the government. Because when they are working, the fair of losing their accommodation always lingers, which will limit their efficiency. And government should spend money on people to rescue them from this, because only a government of the people, by the people, for the people will finally last; people's cohesiveness will be promoted.Otherwise, another vital reason why new building construction deserves more governmental investment lies in the fact that it requires far more resource compare to old building preservation. Build a new building has following prerequisites, land that has been sold by the government via formal procedures, a reliable construction company and tremendous amount of labor. Except these, hundreds of problems would occur during the construction. Thus, only government can cope with it by utilizing its enormous resource like dollars and effectiveness. Generally, personally speaking, I believe new building construction hold the right to gain more money from government.";The debate over whether government funds should prioritize new building projects over the preservation of historic and traditional buildings is a complex one, and I firmly disagree with the notion that new construction should take precedence. While it is essential for communities to grow and develop, the value of preserving history and cultural heritage cannot be overstated.Firstly, historic buildings serve as tangible links to our past, embodying the stories and experiences of previous generations. They provide a sense of identity and continuity within our communities, reminding us of where we came from. By investing in preservation, the government honors these narratives and fosters a sense of belonging among citizens. This connection to history can enhance community pride and stimulate interest in local culture, which can be crucial for social cohesion.Moreover, preservation often proves to be economically beneficial. Restoring and maintaining historic buildings can attract tourism, which supports local businesses and generates revenue for the community. Many cities have successfully transformed their historic districts into vibrant hubs that draw visitors from around the world. Furthermore, adapting existing structures can often be more cost-effective and environmentally sustainable than demolishing old buildings in favor of new construction.Finally, prioritizing new developments over preservation risks eroding the unique characteristics of a community. In our increasingly homogenized world, cities that lose their historical architecture can become indistinct and lackluster, contributing to a loss of diversity in urban landscapes.In conclusion, while new buildings and infrastructure are undeniably important for accommodating growth and development, they should not overshadow the need for preserving our historic and traditional buildings. By investing in the past, we not only honor our heritage, but also bolster our economy and enrich our communities for future generations.
316;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. Use reasons and specific examples to support our answer.;I agree with the statement that our life seems tough at the time but those difficult experiences of life become important lessons for the future. My opinion based on the reasons that Every tough experience makes us more skilled, improves our decision making and makes us more compatible for life.The best example of it is how babies learn about basics survival habits during their childhood. Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking, eating, etc., but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life. For example, when they tried to learn walking, they stumble and hurt themselves many times. But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk.All inventions and experiments are based on many unfortunate observations. No known scientist has success in first attempt. Scientists try and test many specimens before they get they want. It was said that Thomas Edison tested around 10000 bulbs before inventing Light bulb. So, all the initial experiments would be difficult and frustrating for him but he searched for more options and learnt new findings with each experiment even when he was failing in his attempts and finally found break through.Our difficult experiences also make us robust and strong unknowingly. We might be facing a toughest time of life at the time, but when we think back about those moments later in life, we feel more confident about our decisions and about ourselves. When I moved to college hostel after school, first few days were very unsettling for me because first time I was away from parent and staying with people I had not known. I had felt very fragile and emotionally distracted, but then slowly I started adjusting with roommates and built connection with them. I also became more casual and social with others, this experience increased my communication skill and social speaking skills. Therefore, to conclude my opinion on this statement, I want to mentioned that every experience in life whether it is good or bad always gives us something to learn and keep for life. Good experiences give us good memories and bad ones teach us lessons for life.;"Life is full of challenges, and while they may seem daunting in the moment, I firmly believe that most experiences perceived as difficult can emerge as invaluable lessons for the future. These experiences often foster resilience, impart essential skills, and contribute to personal growth.Firstly, navigating through challenging situations can build resilience. For instance, when faced with academic difficulties, such as failing a crucial exam, students are thrust into a situation that demands perseverance. While the immediate feeling of failure can be disheartening, it often motivates them to adopt better study habits and seek help when needed. This process not only improves their academic performance but also instills a sense of determination that can be applied to future hurdles, be it in education or personal endeavors.Moreover, difficult experiences can be profound teachers of life skills. Consider someone who takes on a leadership role in a community project but faces opposition and unexpected complications. Through this experience, they learn valuable skills such as conflict resolution, teamwork, and effective communication. These competencies are essential in many areas of life, including career pursuits. For example, professionals often encounter challenging situations with colleagues or clients; having previously learned to navigate difficulties equips them to handle future conflicts with greater ease.Lastly, difficult experiences contribute significantly to personal growth. An individual who has gone through a breakup may feel heartbroken at the time, yet this experience often leads to self-reflection and increased emotional intelligence. They may learn more about their own needs and boundaries, ultimately resulting in healthier relationships in the future.In summary, while difficult experiences can be painful and overwhelming, they often serve as catalysts for resilience, skill development, and personal growth. Embracing these challenges as opportunities for learning can transform our perspective on adversity and equip us for a brighter future."
317;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Drivers have to pay a fee for driving in busy city streets when there is a great amount of traffic.;"Started in the late eighteenth century, the industrialization and urbanization witnessed the explosion in number of automobiles. The very fuel that they rely on, oil, has now become the dominant pollution of cities' environment. While critics castigating about the exorbitant use of oil and other insisting to charged drivers with extra fee during the rush hours for their selfish conducts, I hold the contention that no additional payment should be charged on them. The reasons are the followings. Capitalism enfranchised people's right to own properties, and consequently, their rights to use them. Driving cars during the rush hours might is bound to polluting cities's environment, but laws protect drivers to do so, and accordingly, charging them extra fee might seems to be out of the jurisdiction. From another point of view, traffic jam is a natural phenomenon that nobody is able to shun or ban; so it is out of drivers' control. Why drivers should pay a fine only for driving their own cars in a particular time? Wars are notorious, but you can't blame the soldiers who are justing fight for their countries.Buying a car spends hundreds of thousand; paying for all sorts of fee takes another several-these are all ready too much for most of the families to bear. Charging drivers one more fee makes no sense and is ridiculous. Majority of the families buy cars simply for a safer and easier conveyance, and charging them too much fee adds a lot to their burden and is actually jeopardizing their rights.Rather than passively forcing drivers to pay another fee, government should instead, be more active on advocating the use of more efficient and environmental-friendly energy or planning out more reasonable and convenient layout that allow people to reach their destinations with less oil. Sometimes traffic jam occur only due to the malfunction of a traffic light, or unreasonable organization of roadways. In these cases, the one who should be charged for a fine is the city planner, not drivers. Simply put, charging drivers fees regardless of the causes of the problems could be ridiculous and even unlawful. In conclusion, ""rush hours"" are usually not the direct consequence of drivers. Instead, the real causes of traffic jam may fall on various of grounds, and therefore, charging drivers for another fee for this could be unreasonable and irrational.";The statement that drivers should pay a fee for driving in busy city streets during times of heavy traffic presents an intriguing argument that warrants thorough consideration. I wholeheartedly agree with this proposition for several compelling reasons.Firstly, imposing a fee for driving in congested areas can significantly reduce traffic volumes. In many metropolitan areas, congestion results in wasted time, increased pollution, and heightened stress levels for commuters. By implementing a fee, cities can incentivize drivers to explore alternative modes of transportation such as public transit, cycling, or walking. For instance, cities like London and Singapore have seen a marked decrease in traffic congestion since introducing road pricing schemes. These initiatives not only alleviate gridlock but also contribute to a more efficient urban transport system.Secondly, the revenue generated from such fees can be reinvested into public infrastructure. Maintenance and enhancement of public transportation systems, improving cycling and pedestrian pathways, and expanding green spaces are some of the potential areas for reinvestment. This creates a virtuous cycle where reduced vehicle traffic leads to improved urban environments. Such financial resources can also help subsidize transportation costs for lower-income individuals, making it easier for them to access necessary services and employment opportunities.Moreover, the environmental benefits of reducing traffic congestion cannot be overstated. Fewer cars on the road lead to reduced carbon emissions and improved air quality, which are crucial for combating climate change and promoting public health.In conclusion, the idea of charging drivers a fee for navigating busy city streets during peak traffic aligns with broader goals of urban sustainability and improved quality of life. It incentivizes responsible transportation choices, generates funds for essential public services, and positively impacts the environment. By embracing this strategy, cities can pave the way for a more sustainable and efficient urban future.
318;Agree or disagree: one of the best ways that parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is to encourage them to take a part-time job.;"Nowadays, the difference between school and society is bigger and bigger. If students want to get used to the society quickly, it is better for parents to encourage them to take part-time jobs. There are some reasons can support my view.First, there are a few opportunities for students to know how to live adult life in the university. Because most people they contact with are also students. However, when students do part-time jobs, they can work with many kinds of people, and most of whom are adults. So, they can teach students many things about adult life. My friend Lisa, who is doing part-time job now, tells me that it is fabulous to take it. Through part-time job, she makes friends with different kinds of people and they let her know the different aspects of adult life. For example, Lisa thought in adult life, work is the core; but after she knows these friends, she changes her mind that the true core for the adult life is responsibility but not work. Hence, thanks to the information her new friends has provided; now she is more confidence about her future adult life. Second, parents always tell students that the adult life is much tenser than school life. However, because we do not experience it, it is very difficult for us to really know how tense the adult life can be. Therefore, we need part-time job to teach us how hard the real adult life can be. Actually, some questionnaires indicate that if students have taken part-time jobs, they will make the best use of their time to prepare their future and more importantly; they will not expect too much for their future than students who have not taken the part-time job. Therefore, the part-time job can make people understand future life better.Third, some parents are afraid that the part-time job will effect student' study. Actually, most students will do the part-time job in their holiday, so it will not effect on their study. Compared with playing computers every day, doing part-time jobs is the best choice for students to spend their holiday.In conclusion, taking the part-time job can let students experience the real adult life and know more about it. Therefore, parents should encourage students to take the part-time job.";One of the best ways parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life is indeed to encourage them to take a part-time job. Agreeing with this notion, there are several key reasons that support the argument.Firstly, part-time jobs instill a sense of responsibility in teenagers. By having to balance work with school and other commitments, teenagers learn to manage their time effectively. This experience is invaluable as they transition into adulthood, where juggling various responsibilities becomes a norm. Managing schedules, deadlines, and commitments fosters skills that are essential in the workforce and in life.Secondly, part-time employment can be a platform for developing critical interpersonal and professional skills. Interacting with coworkers, customers, and supervisors helps teenagers cultivate communication skills and learn the importance of teamwork. These social skills are often as significant as academic knowledge in navigating adult life, as they contribute to building relationships and networking, key components in career advancement.Additionally, working part-time can offer teenagers a sense of financial independence. Having their own income allows them to understand the value of money, budgeting, and saving. It teaches them financial literacy, a crucial skill that will benefit them in managing expenses, debt, and investments in the future. This early exposure to financial responsibility can lead to more prudent financial decisions in adulthood.Moreover, part-time jobs provide teenagers with insights into the real world, helping them explore different career paths and understand the work environment. This exploration can encourage them to reflect on their future aspirations, focus on their education, and understand the importance of perseverance and hard work.In conclusion, encouraging teenagers to take part-time jobs is an excellent strategy for parents to aid in their preparation for adult life. Such experiences promote responsibility, social skills, financial literacy, and career exploration, ultimately equipping them for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
319;Some students prefer to study alone. Others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"Study achievements depend on a range of various factors, one of which is pattern of work you tend to choose while studying. In particular, we may prefer to work either within a team of other students or alone. As for me, I favor the latter because of the following reasons.To begin with, type of temper is one of the reasons that make me to choose individual work instead of team one. Being by nature introvert, I have to spend much time and efforts on adjusting to surroundings and especially new people. Once, when I was working on presentation with strangers, I sat aside and so prepared more than half of work myself instead of making attempts to get acquainted with unknown people. Therefore, my productivity boosts when style of work is appropriate with my type of temper.Furthermore/moreover, working alone allows me to avoid spending time and efforts on many things that are an integral part of teamwork. In other words, I must not divide tasks and duties between team members, share responsibility and benefits, and spend time on teambuilding. These advantages are especially important in situations of shortage of time. About a year ago I was lucky to become a participant of student brainstorming game. To my rivals' surprise, being the only member of my own ""team"" I gained a victory.In conclusion, from my point of view, type of temper and advantages of individual work are the most persuasive arguments in favor of studying alone.";Studying is an integral part of academic success, and students often have different preferences when it comes to their study methods. Some students thrive in solitary environments, while others find group studies more beneficial. Personally, I prefer to study alone, and my inclination towards independent study stems from a variety of reasons.Firstly, studying alone offers a level of focus that is sometimes hard to achieve in a group setting. When I study by myself, I am able to create an environment that is entirely conducive to my learning style. There are no distractions from conversations or differing study paces, allowing me to immerse myself fully in the material. This undisturbed focus helps me to absorb information better, leading to a deeper understanding of complex topics.Moreover, studying alone grants me the freedom to dictate my study schedule and strategies. I can explore subjects at my own pace, dedicating more time to challenging concepts without the pressure of keeping up with peers. This individualized approach also allows me to employ various study techniques, be it mind maps, flashcards, or practice quizzes, according to what I find most effective. For example, during my preparation for final exams, I found that working through practice problems in solitude helped reinforce my understanding far more than discussing them with classmates.Lastly, independent study cultivates self-discipline and responsibility. It forces me to take ownership of my learning, which is an essential skill not only in academics but also in life. As I navigate through challenges on my own, I build resilience and confidence in my abilities. In conclusion, while group study can offer social interaction and collaborative learning, my preference for studying alone stems from the enhanced focus, personal pace, and potential for self-growth it provides. It is in solitude where I find the most effective environment for achieving academic success.
320;Some people prefer to work for themselves or own a business. Others prefer to work for an employer. Would you rather be self-employed, work for someone else, or own a business? Use specific reasons to explain your choice.;Most people want to work for an employer, because they want to feel secure about their salary, or feel comfortable about other problems of having own job such as paying tax, worrying about selling, etc. Despite these problems, personally, I would prefer to have my own job. My arguments are listed as follows. First, time is the more valuable thing, which I have in my life. By having my own business, I can manage my own time. I could work whenever I want, or I do not need to give reasons to my boss for a delay. I can arrange time to travel when I would like. In addition, I can work long hours for earning more money. Totally, the most important reason for me to be self-employed is the sense of free. Moreover, earning money is the fundamental reason that why people work. The amount of money is always the most important criterion for everyone to choose a job. If I work for other people, I have to give my ideas to employers cheaply. Therefore, I never have been rich in my life, because my salary is not dramatically changed. In spite of many problems of having own business, I can earn more money based on my creativity and personal ideas. To sum up, in spite of the fact that many people are not eager to work for themselves, I would like to run my own business to control my own time, and to earn more money based on my noble ideas.;The decision between self-employment, working for someone else, or owning a business encapsulates fundamental preferences about work, autonomy, and risk. Personally, I would rather be self-employed, as it grants me the freedom to pursue my passions, make independent decisions, and develop a work-life balance that suits my individual needs.Self-employment empowers individuals to mold their careers according to their interests and strengths. Being my own boss means I can select projects that resonate with me, which can lead to a heightened sense of fulfillment and motivation. For example, a graphic designer who is self-employed has the liberty to choose clients that align with their artistic vision, as opposed to following a predetermined corporate vision. This freedom fosters creativity and innovation, often resulting in higher-quality output.Moreover, self-employment encourages greater independence and decision-making autonomy. Unlike working for an employer, where one may need to navigate office politics and adhere to rigid structures, self-employment allows me to craft my working environment and processes. This autonomy is not only liberating but can also facilitate a more innovative approach to problem-solving. I can adapt strategies quickly based on market feedback or personal insights without waiting for layers of approval.Finally, self-employment offers the potential for a better work-life balance. By controlling my schedule, I can prioritize time for personal pursuits, family, and self-care, which is often compromised in traditional employment settings. Although the path of self-employment can be fraught with uncertainty and challenges, the reward of living life on my terms makes it an attractive option.In conclusion, while working for someone else or owning a business has its merits, self-employment ultimately aligns best with my vision of a fulfilling and liberated career. The independence, creativity, and flexibility that come with self-employment are invaluable and contribute to my overall happiness and success.
321;Should a city try to preserve its old, historic buildings or destroy them and replace them with modern buildings? use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;"It is important for any city to replace old buildings with new ones, but these revolutions should not include historic buildings. The historic buildings show the history of our ancestors. In addition, they can develop tourism industries by attracting tourists. Historic buildings answer many questions, which are mysterious about our previous ancestors; thereby no one can determine the price of the historic buildings. They show the history of nations and previous generations who lived in the city. They show the lifestyle of people who lived in thousands of years ago. They show us how they survive, or how they defend themselves etc. By investigating about their structures, we can understand how much they knew about the architecture of building. In the other hand, historic buildings are important treasures, which provide an area to learn valuable lessons. Another advantage of historic buildings is their capabilities to attract more tourists to the city. It is interesting for most people to know about the way people live in thousands years ago. Therefore, It is a valuable opportunities for any city having historic buildings to show them to new visitors. Historic building can develop other industries such as restaurants or other food industries and handicrafts shops and so on. These are reasons that why we should preserve historic buildings in the city. They can benefit us financially by developing other industries. Moreover, they are the symbols of our nations, which can show the historical culture of our previous ancestors.";The debate over whether to preserve old, historic buildings or demolish them in favor of modern constructions is a crucial issue faced by many cities worldwide. Preserving historic buildings is essential not only for retaining cultural heritage but also for fostering community identity and boosting local economies.Historic buildings serve as tangible links to a city’s past. They tell stories of cultural, architectural, and historical significance that help educate current and future generations. For instance, cities like Paris and Rome have successfully preserved their historic architecture, which not only reflects their rich history but also becomes an integral part of their identity. Tourists flock to these cities, drawn by their marked character, which contributes significantly to their economies.Moreover, maintaining historic buildings promotes sustainability. Rather than demolishing old structures—often resulting in waste and environmental detriment—renovation allows cities to utilize existing resources. The restoration of buildings reduces the need for new materials, which can alleviate the environmental impact of construction. A prime example is the revitalization of Detroit’s historic sites, which has proven to be both economically fruitful and environmentally conscious.Additionally, preserving historic buildings reinforces community ties. These structures are often landmarks where community events take place or spaces that evoke cherished memories for residents. By keeping these buildings functional, cities encourage a sense of belonging and pride among their inhabitants, fostering social cohesion.In contrast, while proponents of modern constructions argue that contemporary architecture addresses current needs and reflects modern lifestyles, it often lacks the character and charm of historic buildings. These new structures may appear sterile and uninspiring, failing to inspire the same attachment and admiration.In conclusion, cities should prioritize the preservation of their historic buildings over their demolition. By doing so, they safeguard their cultural heritage, promote sustainable practices, and strengthen community bonds, ensuring that the stories of the past continue to enrich the lives of their citizens.
322;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Learning is a thing that we do in all of our lives. Getting the best lessons, besides our abilities to self-study, depends on our teachers a lot. There are people who believe that no one else is better than our parents in terms of teachers. I whole-heartedly agree with this opinion because of these following reasons.Firstly, parents are our teachers from the very early time in our life. As we were born, parents taught us from the very little things such as how to smile, how to walk to the ordinary routines such as eating. Moreover, when we grow bigger, they teach us many fairy tales and several important ethic lessons that affect us till the end of our lives.Secondly, at school we study bigger things about sciences and languages, but after school we learn from our parents. In my opinion, we spend most of our time at home with our families than it at school. I think when we leave school, maybe we will forget parts of the lessons we learn at school if we do not experience them in life, but I strongly believe we will never forget what our parents have taught us because we use it every day. For example, I believe I will never forget what my parents told me about how to be grateful to other people who help me.Thirdly, I totally believe parents love their sons or daughters unconditionally. Therefore, even when we grow older, get married and then have our own families with spouses and children, parents always keep watching us and help us to realize which is right and which is wrong in life. For instance, my older brother has got married and lived independently for two years but when he faces difficulties in his work or his life, he comes back to meet our parents and ask for advice.To conclude, I strongly believe that parents are our best teachers.;While the assertion that parents are the best teachers holds considerable merit, I would argue that, while they certainly play a pivotal role in a child's education, they are not the only or always the best teachers. Education is a multifaceted process, and the role of teachers, mentors, and external experiences significantly contributes to a child's overall development.First and foremost, parents serve as a child’s first teachers, imparting foundational knowledge and life skills. They foster emotional intelligence, social skills, and moral values, which are essential for navigating everyday life. For instance, by teaching children how to share, empathize, and communicate, parents lay the groundwork for successful social interactions. A child who feels supported at home is likely to cultivate healthy relationships outside of the family unit. However, as children grow, their needs evolve. Formal educators bring specialized knowledge and expertise that parents may not possess. Subjects such as mathematics, science, and history require a level of expertise that is often beyond a parent's capability. For example, a child may struggle with complex algebraic concepts that a trained teacher could explain effectively. Moreover, teachers are skilled in various pedagogical strategies that can cater to diverse learning styles, something which a parent, despite their love and good intentions, may not uniquely address. Additionally, peer interactions and experiences outside the home further enrich education. Schools offer environments where children learn to collaborate, resolve conflicts, and adapt to different social situations. Such interactions cannot be wholly replicated within the family. In conclusion, while parents undoubtedly play a critical role in teaching foundational values and skills, they are not necessarily the best teachers for every aspect of a child's education. A balanced approach, utilizing both parental guidance and professional education, leads to a more comprehensive learning experience.
323;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Workers would be much happier if they are doing different types of tasks during their workday than doing the same task.;"In my family, the argument topic between my father and mother always involves my father's job. Five years ago, he quitted his 20 years job as an architectural engineer, and became a landscape painter. Every time I asked him why, he will say, seriously,"" I am done, doing this same work for 20 years and I really want to try some different, that is all."" While there are innumerous people will deem it ridiculous and argue doing the same task is the meaning of job, but from my perspective, I am on the side of my father.Most of workers have adapted to do same task. It allows us to achieve more. As a authoritative dentist in my province, my mother has worked for 25 years. Gandhi devoted his whole life to fight against British-ruled government and inspire movements for civil rights in India, finally he became the father of the nation. These examples make it obvious that great achievement needs someone keen on one task for long time. While when it comes to ""happier"", different type of jobs can be responsible factor.Doing different tasks makes employees and employers much happier. Workers, who work for an ordinary company or industry, will be sick of same tasks day by day. Although they can be familiar with their job, changing of job is what serve to their happier. Changing the type of work will be fresh and elicit their potential to adapt a new environment, which, according to psychology theories, makes workers relaxed and happier. To set another example, consider every workers have ability to do several kinds of work, employers will be satisfied by the generating benefits. They both will be happy because the change of job, not the same task day by day.Different types of tasks during workday brings more challenges, making life colorful. Just like a song, if I did not have challenge, life would be blue. As an engineering researcher, I will surely be disappointed for failure, and exited for new challenges. New challenges from different tasks amounts far more than more works, it also means through dealing with it, I will obtain more knowledge and experience. As the saying of a Chinese writer, the color of life is rooted not in Japanese cherry blossom or Canadian maple leaf, but rather there always exists new things and challenge. After all, doing same task day and night just server to increase our psychological burden, connecting with different types of job is capable give us more colors to our life.To sum up, I admire my father's choice, while the same task give us opportunities to be an expert, like my mom, I still hold the firm view that different types of tasks endow more colors to our life.";The statement that workers would be much happier if they engaged in a variety of tasks throughout their workday rather than performing the same task repeatedly is one that resonates strongly in today’s diverse work environment. I wholeheartedly agree with this assertion, as diversified work not only enhances job satisfaction but also boosts productivity and creativity.First and foremost, performing a variety of tasks can prevent monotony. Repetitive tasks can lead to boredom, reducing motivation and a sense of purpose within the workplace. When workers engage in different activities, they remain mentally stimulated and often find renewed energy and enthusiasm for their work. For instance, someone who alternates between administrative duties, client interactions, and project planning is likely to experience a sense of accomplishment from the varied challenges they face, which can greatly enhance their overall happiness.Moreover, diversified work cultivates a broad skill set. Workers who are exposed to different tasks often develop new skills and competencies that can lead to personal and professional growth. This continuous learning fosters a more dynamic workplace where employees feel valued and appreciated for their contributions. A recent study in organizational psychology has shown that workers who engage in a range of tasks often exhibit higher levels of engagement and commitment to their organizations.Lastly, the opportunity to collaborate with various teams or departments is another beneficial aspect of diverse task assignments. Such interactions can foster a sense of community and belonging, both of which are essential for employee satisfaction. When workers feel connected to their colleagues through collaborative efforts, it creates a more supportive work culture that further enhances happiness.In conclusion, engaging in different types of tasks throughout the workday leads to a more fulfilling and enjoyable work experience. By reducing monotony, promoting skill development, and fostering collaboration, diverse tasks contribute significantly to worker happiness and overall productivity in the workplace.
324;Do you agree or disagree with the statement, in order to succed in doing a new job, the ability to adapt oneself in a new environment is more important than excellent knowledge of this job.;With the rapid development of economy, the controversial of good worker's requirement is always in a limelight. A large number of people will say the ability to adapt oneself to a new environment is necessary, because it is the basic communication skill for a new worker. From my perspective, there is only one thing would be beneficial to company, and there is only one way to be an outstanding worker, that is possessing excellent knowledge of this job. That's why I believe that the excellent knowledge of this job will be more significant.Admittedly, the ability to adapt oneself to the new environment has been proven to be part of job. This ability is helpful in communicating with other workmates, cooperating with other workers needs this ability, too. But working alone is a longer-term job than communicating, that is, the ability of adapting oneself to a new environment may be necessary for a fresh worker, but the excellent knowledge of this job will be benefit till one leave. The company will benefit from every worker of excellent knowledge. The core and most profitable technology of an IT company is invented by a worker with excellent computer knowledge, not a worker with outstanding communicating skill. The high reputation and popularity of a company is earned by some brilliant workers in public relation department with excellent skill to propagate this company. So the company will earn more money and reputation from these workers with excellent knowledge. Employees will obtain reward from hard-work pursuing excellent knowledge. Through our whole study life, undergraduate and graduate, we keep learning with the purpose of exerting these knowledge and experience on our job, just like an old Chinese scholar said, the essence of study is utilizing it. After we get a job, the destination of we keep accumulating and collecting knowledge is rooted not in fawn on our manager with the ability to adapt this kind of business culture, but in making us excellent and totally master this job. Finally, we will be rewarded with pride. That's why we can obtain reward from out excellent knowledge.To sum up, I would have to say that although we can use the ability of adapting oneself in a new environment, the excellent knowledge will be of more importance. Because it can not only benefit our employers, but also ourselves will be rewarded.;In the contemporary workforce, the ability to adapt to new environments often stands out as a more crucial factor for success than possessing extensive knowledge pertaining to a specific job. While expertise and technical skills are undeniably significant, adaptability plays a vital role in navigating the rapidly changing dynamics of any workplace.Firstly, the modern job market is characterized by frequent shifts in technology, organizational structures, and processes. Employees are often required to handle unexpected challenges and learn new systems or practices on the fly. Those who can quickly adjust their mindset and approach are better positioned to thrive in such environments. For instance, a program manager may excel at project planning but will falter if resistant to changes in project scope or team dynamics. Thus, adaptability ensures that individuals remain effective even when faced with uncertainty.Moreover, a collaborative workplace culture increasingly emphasizes teamwork and interpersonal skills. The ability to build rapport and communicate effectively with diverse colleagues is often more beneficial than technical knowledge alone. When an employee exhibits a willingness to learn from others and an openness to new ideas, they can leverage the strengths of their team, fostering innovation and driving project success. Conversely, an employee with deep job-specific knowledge who is rigid or resistant to change may struggle in a dynamic environment. Such rigidity can hinder not only personal growth but also impede the progress of the entire team. In conclusion, while excellent knowledge of a job is undoubtedly important, the ability to adapt to new environments is paramount in today’s ever-evolving workspace. Employing adaptability allows individuals to grow, collaborate, and thrive amidst changes, ultimately leading to greater career success.
325;Some people say that computers have made life easier and more convenient. Other people say that computers have made life more complex and stressful. What is your opinion? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Computers have revolutionized our lifestyle during last century. However, some people especially young ones use computers extremely and this excessive usage lead to increase stress among them, but computers have brought many advantages to our lives. From my point of view, computers have an important and inevitable role in economic, business, and other part of societies. In addition, they make the way of living easier by doing our routine duties. Admittedly, by using computers in many industries human's role has been reduced. Nowadays, computer can control and perform some routine activities in industries, which were early done by human. Many industries use computers to command to robots in order to do many regular tasks, which were carried out by human early. For example, many processes of production of cars are carrying out by robots, which are controlled by computers. In addition, car companies use computers to simulate and analyze car accident by computers. Despite many advantages, by coming computers many jobs has been vanished. A large number of industries fire many forces because of doing their works by new technologies and computers. Computers have an important role in social and personal life. Computers have opened up a network connection among people. This technology makes easier for people to send and receive personal message. Teenagers and adolescents spend free time in front of computers. Moreover, People can use computers to extract their essential information easily. By contrast, excessive use of computers has brought many difficulties. The results show that teenagers who are addicted to computer games show more violent and stressful behaviors. People who have type by computers may suffer from such disease related to knees. By considering all reasons, advantages of computers outweigh disadvantages. People benefit more from coming computers into their lives. In addition, computers can do most difficult tasks which leads to make life easier.;The advent of computers has undeniably transformed our lives, sparking a debate about whether they have simplified our existence or introduced unwelcome complexity and stress. In my opinion, while computers offer significant conveniences, they also add layers of complications that often lead to stress.On the one hand, computers have certainly made many day-to-day tasks more manageable. For instance, the accessibility of information through the internet allows individuals to obtain knowledge on virtually any subject within seconds. Online banking and e-commerce have simplified transactions, enabling users to manage finances and shop from the comfort of their homes. Additionally, the advent of remote work, facilitated by computers, has provided flexibility that was previously unimaginable, allowing for a better work-life balance for many.However, alongside these conveniences, computers can create complexity and stress. The vast amount of information available online can be overwhelming and lead to information overload, making it difficult to discern credible sources. Moreover, constant connectivity through emails, social media, and notifications keeps individuals in a state of perpetual alertness, blurring the lines between personal and professional lives. This can lead to burnout and anxiety, as individuals feel the pressure to be always available and responsive.Furthermore, the fast-paced technological advancements can leave some people struggling to keep up, fostering feelings of inadequacy or frustration. Many older adults, for example, may find the transition to using computers particularly daunting, resulting in a sense of alienation from the increasingly digital world.In conclusion, while computers have certainly enhanced convenience and efficiency in many aspects of life, they have also introduced a range of complexities and stressors. To fully enjoy the benefits of technology, society must find a balance that allows for both productivity and well-being, promoting a healthier relationship with computers.
326;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?Children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your position.;Learning a foreign language is necessary for children to strengthen their ability to learn. Whether children should start learning a foreign language as they start school or not might be a controversial issue. It seems to me that students should start learning that as they start school. Learning that not only help them to improve their minds and memories, but can extend their visions about the other countries. First, the ability of Learning in the childhood period is more powerful than other periods of life. Thereby students in the beginning of their education can learn faster and easier in compare to a young one to understand a foreign language. They can easily understand the language structure and memorize the vocabularies. It is out of of the questioned that the persistence of learning a knowledge in the childhood is more than other period of lives. By considering this and being aware of that students have not any responsibility and other difficulty in comparison with a young man, we can infer that why this time is the best time to learn any language.In addition, Learning a foreign language helps students tremendously to comprehend what happens in the around World. They would be able to understand other cultures and costumes. Moreover, It can give them a sense of power to communicate better with peers in other parts of the World. Having knowledge about other countries and their languages lead to extend the child's vision. Therefore, they would be able to develop their personalities and sense of reliance. Overall, it is easy to distinguish between a child having two languages and a child having just his native language while comparing their ability to communicate, understanding other studies, etc, to find that why children should start learning a foreign language in the beginning of the education.;I strongly agree that children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. Early exposure to foreign languages fosters cognitive development, cultural awareness, and enhances future opportunities for children.Firstly, starting language education at a young age harnesses children's innate ability to absorb information. Research has shown that children’s brains are particularly adaptable in their formative years, making it easier for them to acquire new sounds, vocabulary, and grammatical structures. For example, children can often achieve native-like pronunciation when they are exposed to a foreign language early on, an advantage that diminishes with age. By integrating language learning into their education from the outset, children can develop a more profound linguistic intuition and proficiency.Secondly, learning a foreign language enriches cultural understanding and empathy. In today's globalized world, cultural sensitivity is paramount. When children learn a foreign language, they not only acquire the means of communication but also gain insights into the corresponding culture. For instance, a student learning Spanish might explore the rich traditions of Spanish-speaking countries, fostering respect and appreciation for diversity. This cultural exposure can dismantle stereotypes and promote inclusiveness, leading to a more harmonious society.Lastly, being bilingual or multilingual opens numerous doors for future academic and professional opportunities. In an increasingly competitive job market, employers often seek candidates with language skills. For example, a student proficient in Mandarin may find themselves at an advantage in business sectors that trade with China. By beginning language education early, schools are equipping students with skills that will prove valuable throughout their lives.In conclusion, initiating foreign language learning in early education paves the way for cognitive benefits, cultural awareness, and enhanced career prospects. Given these compelling reasons, it is evident that foreign language acquisition should be an integral part of every child's educational journey.
327;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Boys and girls should attend separate schools. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Women or men almost need each other in full of life even in school. Although some experts believe that common schools for both female and male lead to diminish their efficiency in education, others view it as a helpful way to recognize the opposite gender. In my opinion, boys and girls should study together in the sense that they have a chance to know each other and learn how to behave with an opposite sex. School is a small society for students, which prepares them for the future life. By attending to the same school, students can learn how to view the opposite gender in classes as a friend or a classmate. In addition, a boy would know how to speak with a girl in every situation and vice versa. They would know how to ask her in order to cooperate with his study, how communicate with girls in a group, etc. Admittedly, when they study together and help each other, they exercise the the real life as they age. By contrast, some experts believe that attending both girls and boys in a same school cause many disadvantages for them. By doing this, outdoors relationships may expand and it may accompany with sexual relationship and as result, their thoughts deviate from the studies. Moreover, attending in the school having boys and girls might be beneficial for both to increase their motivation to study better. Boys and girls will try to show their capabilities and abilities in the class, therefore they will study increasingly. Indeed, Boys do not like to seem weak in front of girls and vice versa. As a result, the productivity of the class will be increased. In a word, attending boys and girls in a same school would bring many advantages. Taking part in the study groups would increase student's motivation to study more. In addition, they would be able to know the opposite gender, which help them to be prepared for the adult life where they almost will live or work together.;"The debate over whether boys and girls should attend separate schools raises important questions about education, gender dynamics, and societal norms. I strongly disagree with the notion that boys and girls should be educated in separate institutions. Coeducational environments offer significant advantages that not only foster academic growth but also prepare students for real-world interactions.Firstly, attending the same schools encourages mutual respect and understanding between genders. In a coeducational setting, boys and girls learn to collaborate and communicate effectively with one another, skills that are essential in both academic and professional environments. For instance, group projects often require diverse viewpoints; working alongside peers of the opposite gender enhances creativity and problem-solving by introducing differing perspectives.Moreover, mixed-gender schools can help to break down harmful stereotypes that may arise in single-gender classrooms. For instance, boys may feel pressured to conform to certain masculine behaviors that discourage emotional expression, while girls might be steered toward more traditional roles. Coeducation allows students to see beyond these stereotypes and fosters an atmosphere where individual interests and talents can flourish without gender constraints. A boy who enjoys drama or a girl who excels in science should not feel confined by societal expectations regarding their gender.Another argument against single-sex education is the inadequacy of its impact on academic performance. Research indicates that the perceived benefits of single-gender schools, such as reduced distractions or increased confidence, do not hold up when considering long-term educational outcomes. Coeducational systems have shown that they can produce equally, if not more, academically successful students.In conclusion, I firmly believe that boys and girls should not attend separate schools. Coeducational environments enrich the learning experience, foster respect between genders, and prepare students for a diverse and inclusive society. By ensuring that boys and girls learn together, we promote a more balanced and harmonious future."
328;Some people believe that success in life comes from taking risks or chances. Others believe that success results from careful planning. In your opinion, what does success come from? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. ;"""The biggest risk is not taking any risk."" The ones who have a big dream, they need to be brave and dare to live new situations. It is not guaranteed that you are going to achieve your dream if you had planned carefully as the same way when you take risks, but it is more frustrating if you had made plans and then it went wrong. Therefore, it is essential to take chances and believe this is going to work out. Assuming new opportunities is indispensable to have diverse experiences. In fact, life may not be easy; it will have various challenges especially when you take risks, but in the end, it can be surprisingly wonderful. For instance, some people abandon their job, family and friends and go to other country without knowing what the future holds for them. In the beginning, it can be tough to fit in this new place and find any opportunity, but after fighting against the obstacles blocking the way to get what is desired; it is possible to conquer what they are craving as well as start to build a new life in this other country. In fact, many people are afraid to take risks and fail. It is possible to get frustrate along the way, but it is vital to never give up on your dream. To illustrate, Walt Disney, whose career is famous, had a challenging life. One of the difficulties was some of his histories, such as Mickey Mouse and Three Little Pigs, were turned down. He heard lots of ""no"", furthermore one editor fired him alleging that he had no imagination, after all what he had gone through, he never stop chasing his dreams. To conclude, in this competitive world you have to be fearless and face all new situations. Even though sometimes you consider backing down and stay in the same routine that you are used to, it is necessary to have courage to take risks, be different and pursue your dream to have a successful life.";Success is a multifaceted concept that can be achieved through various paths, with two predominant schools of thought being the importance of taking risks and the value of careful planning. In my opinion, genuine success is most effectively attained through a combination of both approaches, as they complement and reinforce each other.On one hand, taking risks is often essential for growth and opportunity. Many of the most successful individuals in history, from entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs to athletes such as Michael Jordan, achieved greatness by stepping out of their comfort zones. For example, consider the story of J.K. Rowling, who faced multiple rejections before “Harry Potter” became a publishing phenomenon. Her willingness to take the risk of sharing her work and embracing failure ultimately led to monumental success. This illustrates how embracing uncertainty can open doors to amazing opportunities that meticulous planning alone may not uncover.However, while risk-taking can lead to extraordinary outcomes, it is not without the need for a solid plan. Careful planning provides a roadmap that can guide individuals through their endeavors. For instance, launching a new business involves not just the courage to start but also the strategic foresight to create a business model, conduct market research, and develop a marketing strategy. A well-thought-out plan minimizes the consequences of failure by preparing one for potential challenges, thus increasing the likelihood of success.In conclusion, success is best approached through a balanced fusion of risk-taking and careful planning. While risks can catalyze unprecedented achievements, a strategic plan helps to navigate the complexities of life. Ultimately, those who skillfully blend these elements are the ones who are most likely to find success.
329;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"People should sometimes do things, even though they don't enjoy it. This is basic part of the lives. There may be small or big things, but at last people should accept them, because most of them is about responsibilities. Moreover, sometimes by doing things helps the people learn about live. In this essay, the reasons for why I agree that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing will be explored. Firstly, most people's lives are filled with tasks that they don't enjoy doing.In personal live, we have some responsibilities towards to other people, there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities. For instance, housework is very difficult for me, although my husband helps me some of them, but it is my responsibility. I really don't like any of them, however I should do. Secondly,professional lives are filled with tasks that is neccessary parts of the jobs. Nobody likes attending boring conferences, or working a person who isn't well in with anyone. I'm a research asistant at a university, and as any of the univesity in ours we have a professor who isn't good at human relationships, most of the asistans don't enjoy to talk with him about any situation, although we have to ask about his field. Thirdly, doing something which an individual doesn't enjoy can led to enjoyment. People sometimes can attend any activities by insisting on any of their friends although they don't really want. For example, one of our friends tell my husband and me about a dance course which we both don't like. After insisting on some of our friends, we attended, and got really enjoyable time, we continued the course about six months although most of our friends left the course after a month.Nobody has a life with a lot of fun; there are sometimes unpleasant and boring parts which is not liked by anyone, but most of them are about responsibilities which is the part of individual's live.";I wholeheartedly agree with the statement that people should sometimes engage in activities they do not enjoy. While pursuing personal interests and passions is crucial for individual happiness, there are significant benefits associated with stepping outside of one's comfort zone and tackling tasks that might initially seem unpleasant.Firstly, engaging in activities that one does not enjoy often leads to personal growth. For instance, many adults find themselves in jobs that require skills outside of their preferred areas of expertise. Although tasks such as public speaking or analyzing financial reports may not be enjoyable, they contribute to overall skill development. By facing these challenges, individuals enhance their competencies, paving the way for career advancement or even discovering new passions. For example, someone who despises writing may find that composing an essay improves their communication skills tremendously, benefiting both their personal and professional life.Secondly, doing things that we do not enjoy can foster a sense of responsibility and accountability. Life is filled with obligations—whether they are household chores, professional duties, or social commitments. For example, a student may not enjoy attending a particular class but recognizes the value of education. By attending, they gain knowledge and discipline, ultimately equipping them for future challenges. Learning to embrace responsibility builds character and cultivates traits such as perseverance and resilience.Moreover, participating in unenjoyable tasks can strengthen relationships. Many social interactions involve compromises, such as spending time with friends or family during activities that do not particularly excite us. However, these efforts often strengthen bonds, demonstrating our willingness to invest in relationships, even when it requires sacrifice.In conclusion, while doing enjoyable activities is essential for personal fulfillment, engaging in tasks we do not enjoy serves critical roles in personal growth, responsibility, and relationship-building. Balancing both types of activities is essential for a well-rounded and fulfilling life.
330;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? It is more important for the government to spend money on new buildings than to preserve historic or traditional buildings and homesÊ;The city where I was born used to be of a great antique beauty, which was surrounded with by lots of ancient style buildings. Unfortunately, the unstoppable trend of urbanization makes me only appreciate parts of those classic buildings in the pictures or in museums. In order to prevent the disappearance of the historic buildings, some citizens suggest the government to spend money on historic buildings. As far as I am concerned, we should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings, letting next generations still have a chance to look at them. Here are some reasons and examples to illustrate my viewpoint. Historic buildings have intrinsic values, because they are significant symbols of a city. Old buildings are reminders of a city's culture and complexity. By seeing historic buildings -- whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic, people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area. For example, when somebody mentions Beijing, China's capital city, you will immediately have Capital Palace come to appear in your mind, because it is the most remarkable sign of the city, and also it is the inevitable history of Beijing, even the entire China. Depending on the study of Capital Palace, researchers have a comprehensive understanding of the history and the culture. Furthermore, historic buildings make our lives more colorful, provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds. The city is occupied with an abundance of modern houses and and high buildings which make it crowded, and no rooms for people to relax themselves. However, the warmth of the materials, the heart pine, marble, or the old brick, all those old buildings features call back of our inner peace. Lying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life's little annoyance and feel peaceful. Meanwhile, historic buildings can be a source of maintenance fees. There are many historic buildings, such as Beijing Place, Shanghai Artist Museum, they are all able to support themselves financially by charging tens of thousands of tourists. Our governments will be happy with those efficient consequences, and a majority of cities also can imitate this economical cycle. Overall, I believe that the city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity. However, the preservation of old buildings is a one-way street. There is no chance to renovate to save a history site once it's gone. This reality brings us to light the importance of locating and saving old buildings of historic significance. Therefore, government should spend money on preservation of old buildings.;The debate over whether governments should prioritize spending on new buildings rather than preserving historic or traditional structures is both complex and nuanced. I firmly disagree with the notion that investing in new constructions is more important than safeguarding our heritage. The preservation of historic buildings plays an integral role in maintaining cultural identity, fostering community pride, and promoting sustainable urban development.First and foremost, historic buildings serve as tangible links to our past. They tell stories of the architectural styles, societal values, and historical events that shaped our communities. By preserving these structures, governments not only honor the achievements and struggles of those who came before us but also provide future generations with a sense of place and continuity. The character and charm of a city often stem from its historical architecture, influencing both residents’ quality of life and tourists’ perceptions.Moreover, investing in preservation can prove economically beneficial. Historic buildings can attract tourism, leading to increased revenue for local businesses. For instance, in cities renowned for their heritage structures, the tourism industry flourishes, creating jobs and bolstering the economy. Additionally, restoring and repurposing old buildings is often more sustainable than constructing new ones. It reduces waste and conserves materials, aligning with modern environmental goals.Furthermore, new buildings, while potentially beneficial, can lead to a loss of community character and displacement of long-standing residents. Urban development often prioritizes profit over community, resulting in homogenous constructions that lack cultural significance. In contrast, preservation maintains neighborhoods' unique identities and fosters community cohesion.In conclusion, while the construction of new buildings can contribute to progress, the preservation of historic structures is vital for safeguarding our cultural heritage. By prioritizing both, governments can create vibrant, diverse, and sustainable communities that celebrate their past while shaping a bright future.
331;Some young adults want independence from their parents as soon as possible. Other young adults prefer to live with their families for a longer time. Which of the solutions do you think is better? Use specific reasons and examples to support your opinion.;As young people gets older they tend to seek more freedom and want to live on their own. But, the issue of what is the right age for young adults to leave their parents and start living on their own is a contentious one. Personally, I believe that young adults should live with their parents for a longer period of time.Living on your own is a huge financial commitment. At younger age people are less likely to get a high paying job, so It can be a difficult task to pay for rent, food, utilities and other expenses to sustain yourself. So, I believe that living with parents is a wise choice for adults until they get a head start to their professional career with a reasonable income.Another advantage of living with parents for a longer period of time is the enhanced emotional attachment with them. Parents have valuable advice to their children as they go through the changes in their adult life. Living together develops the environment of discussing adult's physiological and psychological changes face to face with their parents. Young adults will feel reluctant to discuss such problems with their parents if they move out and live on their own, and thus missing the valuable input of their parents.While some critics may argue that, young adults living with parents will not be free to do what they want. However, I believe that most young adults are inclined to take unprecedented advantages of the freedom they have. It is good thing if living with parents does not give freedom for young people to party all night, smoke or do drugs. In a nutshell, I believe that young adults should only consider living on their own only after they are sure they could sustain on their own. It is unwise to trade the opportunity of living with parents for a longer period of time for some late night parties or drugs. Thus, to cope with the physiological and psychological changes of adult life, to make financial life a less struggle and to prevent oneself digress from their destined path, it is important for young adults to live with their parents for a longer period of time.;The transition from adolescence to adulthood marks a crucial phase in an individual's life, often characterized by the desire for independence or, conversely, the preference to remain with family. While both choices have their merits, I believe that young adults seeking independence as soon as possible can develop essential life skills and foster personal growth more effectively than those who choose to live with their parents for an extended period.One of the primary benefits of early independence is the opportunity for self-discovery. When young adults venture out on their own, they are faced with the need to navigate daily responsibilities such as managing finances, cooking, and maintaining a household. These experiences promote problem-solving and decision-making skills, crucial components of personal development. For instance, a young adult living independently learns to budget their expenses, which instills financial literacy that will serve them well throughout life.Moreover, living independently encourages resilience and adaptability. Young adults must confront challenges without relying on familial support, which cultivates a sense of accountability and confidence. For instance, facing obstacles such as a difficult job market or unexpected bills can teach valuable lessons about perseverance and resourcefulness. These hardships ultimately contribute to character-building and prepare individuals for the complexities of adulthood.In contrast, while remaining at home may provide a sense of comfort and security, it can also create an environment that limits personal growth and fosters dependency. Young adults who stay with their parents may miss out on essential experiences that help them develop autonomy. Research shows that those who delay independence can struggle with challenges in the workplace or personal relationships due to a lack of practical experience.In conclusion, aspiring for independence while young ultimately equips individuals with the tools to thrive in adulthood. The skills and confidence gained from navigating life’s challenges on their own can lead to greater success and fulfillment in the long run. Thus, I believe that young adults pursuing independence sooner rather than later is the better solution.
332;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development.;Nowadays, the Earth has become like a small village. In the course of the last hundred years, the way majority of people communicate with each other has been altered significantly because of technology. But there are vast amount of disputes whether it is positive or negative. From my point of view, this development was a very positive one in spite of its some drawbacks.To begin with, nowadays, to keep in touch with loved ones in faraway places has become easy than ever. Technology revolutionized the way we communicate and in present, it is almost possible to do everything without tete-a-tete. By means of some software such as Skype, MSN, Whatsapp we can get in touch with everybody whenever we want. For example, in earlier times, people didn't leave for faraway places, because they could easily get lost. This is also one salient prove that the development of technology was a very positive.Further, by means of some communication tools, it has become very easy to make new friends. According to statistics, 40% of people met even their life partners via Internet. In this sense, Internet is a basic tool to keep in touch with old and make new friends.However, the other side of the coin is that, by communicating via Internet or phone, we cannot express our ideas and feelings fully, because during such conversations, some of our words can make a completely different sense. As a result, the rate of divorces is increasing day by day. By way of conclusion, I once again restate my position that the development of technology impacted on the means of communication among people very positively by making it easier and more comfortable.;In recent years, technology has transformed the way individuals interact, significantly altering their relationships. With the proliferation of social media platforms, instant messaging apps, and video conferencing tools, communication has become instantaneous and widely accessible. This evolution has led to both positive and negative developments in the types of relationships individuals forge.One notable change is the emergence of virtual friendships. Social media enables people to connect with others across geographical boundaries, fostering relationships based on shared interests rather than proximity. Individuals can engage with diverse communities and form connections that they might never have encountered in their local environments. This democratization of relationships can be seen as a positive development, providing support networks and promoting inclusivity.However, technology has also contributed to superficial interactions. Many relationships in the digital age exist predominantly online, leading to a decline in face-to-face communication. While online interactions can be convenient, they often lack the emotional depth and authenticity found in personal, in-person connections. The prevalence of online personas can result in misunderstandings, as the nuances of human emotions are often lost in text-based communication. This shift raises concerns about the overall quality of relationships and individual well-being.Moreover, the constant connectivity facilitated by technology can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. While people might have numerous online connections, these often do not translate into meaningful relationships. The pressure to maintain an online presence can also detract from real-world relationships, with individuals prioritizing virtual engagement over quality time spent with friends and family.In conclusion, technology has indubitably reshaped interpersonal relationships, allowing for broader connections while simultaneously raising concerns about depth and authenticity. To harness the benefits of technology while mitigating its downsides, individuals must strive to balance their digital interactions with genuine face-to-face relationships, ensuring that technology serves as a bridge rather than a barrier.
333;With the increasing use and development of new technology, many machines are now able to do the work which people used to perform. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend?;The issue of whether using of machine are bring many advantages to society is of great concern to many people. In my opinion, although using machines have many benefits, we cannot ignore its negative effects.It is undoubted that machines can bring many benefits. For one thing, machines are more effective than human. Not like human, machines do not need rest, which means they can work as long as employers want and consistently produce high quality products without any mistakes. For another, using machines can save company's money. Because machines never ask for salary, over-time pay or pension, so employers do not need to spend money on employee's welfare. The company only needs some technicians to make sure machines are working on the right track or replace some part when machines are not working. However, the disadvantages of machines that bring to us should not be neglected by people. To start with, because of extensive of using machines, many people loss their job. Especially in large population countries, high unemployment rate may cause crime and social instability. Apart from this, using of machines are also pose serious pollution and energy dissipation. For example, nowadays people prefer to use dish-washing machine to wash dishes and plates rather than hand washing. But they did not know that compared with hand washing dish-washing machine consume at least 2 times water and electricity to wash these tableware. As you can imagine, if thousands of families use dish-washing machines, how many water and how much electricity will be wasted!In conclusion, although we cannot deny machines are play a vital role in people living and working, problems posed by machines should draws more attentions as well.;The increasing integration of technology into our everyday lives has ushered in a significant transformation, leading to machines taking over tasks that were once the domain of human workers. This trend presents both advantages and disadvantages that merit examination.On the positive side, the automation of tasks can vastly improve efficiency and productivity. Machines can work continuously, performing repetitive tasks faster and more accurately than humans. For instance, in manufacturing, robots can assemble products at a speed and precision that far exceeds human capability. This not only reduces the time taken to produce goods but also minimizes human error, contributing to higher quality outputs. Moreover, automation can free up human workers from monotonous and physically demanding jobs, allowing them to focus on more complex and creative tasks that require critical thinking and problem-solving skills.However, the rise of machines comes with significant drawbacks, particularly regarding employment. As machines become capable of performing tasks traditionally handled by humans, there is a growing concern about job displacement. Skilled workers may find themselves at risk of redundancy, leading to increased unemployment rates and a widening economic divide. Additionally, the transition to a more automated workforce can create anxiety and resistance among employees, who may fear that they lack the necessary skills to keep pace with advancing technology.Furthermore, over-reliance on machines may result in a loss of essential human skills. As people become increasingly dependent on technology, there is a risk that basic skills, such as problem-solving and interpersonal communication, may deteriorate over time. In conclusion, while the mechanization of work presents compelling advantages in terms of efficiency and productivity, it also raises pressing concerns regarding job security and skill retention. Balancing these contrasting facets will be vital as society navigates this transformative era of technological advancement.
334;In the last 20 years there have been significant developments in the field of information technology (IT), for example, the World Wide Web and communication by email. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;Decade after decade, every day, scientists discover magnificent devices in the field of IT, such as interactive boards, multicore computers and laptops, tablets, which have an incredible resolution and also mobile phones, which have the power of a computer. World Wide Web and communication via email are some of the positive sides of information technology, however, there are some negative aspects.Firstly, connecting people by email is easy and fast. In addition, World Wide Web offers humanity to access to information, which they want to know for less than 10 seconds. These are two of the benefits, why IT is useful.Besides, nowadays technology is entering into our society really quick and scientists develop robots, which help people cope with their problems or just invent coffee machines, engines with integrated computers and etc. For example, before centeries, there were not washing machines, which clean your clothes, while a person do another job.Secondly, there are some drawbacks about this issue. Scientists believe that one day people will face their developments, for instance robots, and they will not succeed to control them. All this inventions will try to take control of the Earth.In conclusion, I agree that IT discoveries are likely to have more disadvantages than benefits and people should know how to use their developments properly.;In the past two decades, advancements in information technology (IT) have revolutionized the way we communicate, learn, and conduct business. Innovations such as the World Wide Web and email have fostered unprecedented connectivity and access to information. However, as we look towards the future, there is a growing concern that developments in IT may yield more negative effects than positive.One of the most pressing issues is privacy. With the proliferation of data-driven technologies, individuals' personal information is increasingly at risk. Cybersecurity threats, including data breaches and identity theft, have escalated, leaving many individuals vulnerable. As technology continues to advance, the potential for misuse of personal data can lead to wider societal issues, including harassment, discrimination, and even personal safety concerns.Furthermore, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), while offering efficiency and innovation, poses risks related to job displacement. As automation takes over tasks traditionally performed by humans, many workers find themselves facing unemployment or the necessity to retrain for new roles. This socioeconomic shift may exacerbate inequalities, leading to further division in society between those who can adapt to new technologies and those who cannot.Additionally, social media platforms, which have transformed communication, often propagate misinformation and contribute to societal polarization. The ability to spread false information rapidly can have dire consequences for public health, democratic processes, and social cohesion.On the other hand, technological advancements undeniably bring numerous benefits, including improved healthcare, enhanced learning opportunities, and greater global collaboration. However, as we contemplate future developments in IT, it is crucial to recognize that these potential benefits come with significant risks. Striking a balance between embracing innovation and implementing robust safeguards will be vital in ensuring that future advancements do not lead to more harm than good. In conclusion, while the evolution of IT has provided vast improvements to our daily lives, the looming challenges related to privacy, employment, and social dynamics evoke concern. Therefore, it is reasonable to assert that unless careful measures are taken, future developments in IT could indeed have more negative consequences than positive outcomes.
335;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, celebrities appear to become a spotlight of the mass media. Almost half of the news coverage on television and the Internet is devoted to the celebrity gossip. Not surprisingly, many people are worried that this attention to the famous people has an impact on them, especially on their children. This essay will compare both negative and positive consequences of this effect on infants.Fame is a great responsibility for public people as their admirers are very sensitive to any acts of their idols. Celebrity scandals and gossips can quickly reach the public which perceive it very negatively. This means that celebrities who received attention for overuse of drugs or alcohol are likely to get public disgrace. Therefore, children may see that this behavior is inexcusable.On the other hand, too much news coverage to famous people seems to have a negative influence on the choice of children of their future professions. As recent surveys showed, inspired by the fame and wealth, children now prefer more to become an actor/actress or a sports star than it was in the past. Many schools for preparation of so-called stars and various advertisements about famous people may mislead with the fact that this profession is highly required and easy reachable. This may confuse children who should not choose their future job because of the influence of the mass media, but from the basis of their own interests.In conclusion, parents should be more worried about their children's attitudes to the 'cult of celebrity'. They should teach their children how to distinguish shortcoming stars from truly talented ones and to put right priorities in life.;The influence of media coverage of celebrities on children is a topic that has generated considerable debate in recent years. While some may argue that such coverage is harmless or even beneficial, I firmly believe that the pervasive attention given to celebrity culture has a detrimental effect on children’s development and self-perception.Firstly, the constant exposure to glamorous lifestyles and unrealistic standards set by celebrities can distort a child's understanding of success and happiness. Many celebrities exhibit lives filled with luxury, beauty, and ostentation, which can create unrealistic expectations for children. They may internalize the idea that worth is directly tied to appearance and material possessions, leading to issues such as low self-esteem and body image disturbances. Young minds are particularly impressionable, and without adequate guidance, the values espoused by celebrity culture can overshadow more meaningful ideals such as kindness, hard work, and authenticity.Moreover, relentless media scrutiny often glorifies negative behaviors, such as substance abuse, promiscuity, and aggression. When children idolize celebrities who engage in such conduct, they may mistakenly view these actions as acceptable or even aspirational. The normalization of these behaviors can lead to poor decision-making and unhealthy lifestyle choices. Additionally, the obsession with gossip around celebrities can promote a culture of bullying and shaming, where children feel pressured to conform to peer expectations in the same way they see public figures navigating their lives.In conclusion, while celebrity media culture might provide entertainment, its pervasive influence can be harmful to children's development. It fosters unrealistic expectations and promotes negative behavioral norms that can have lasting effects on young individuals. Therefore, it is crucial for parents and guardians to engage in thoughtful discussions with children about the reality of celebrity culture and to encourage them to pursue healthier, more constructive role models.
336;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;"Recently, there has been a social concern in regards to whether mobile phones have a negative effect in our social communication. Indeed, mobile phones have been widely used for people of all ages, bringing convenience and entertainment into our life. However, as far as I am concerned, I strongly agree with the view that this great invention causes many social problems.In the first place, spending too much time on phones may exert adverse effects on social life. In the first place, as people increasingly tend to focus and relay on phones, they may lose their interest on daily activities like meeting with their friends so that distraction may be developed during study or social activities. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phone may damage both eyesight and physical posture of the children.Furthermore, there are many types of games available in the phone and many of them are very aggressive in nature such as ""Iron man"". In those games, children are rewarded for being more violent, and this violence is repeated again and again. For instance, many games involve children helping their character to kill or shoot, which many lead to increased aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviours. Therefore, the hardship of communication may be developed.However, other people may perceive this issue from different viewpoint. With rapid development of the internet, people are able to enjoy quick electronic communication via internet. For instance, as lots of chatting apps available online such as ""Weichat"", people tend to send instant messages free of charge by using their phones rather than face to face communication. Therefore, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication.After having considered all the problems that I have discussed above, we can finally draw a conclusion that although mobile phones brings convenience of communication, they also contribute to some social problems.";The impact of technology, particularly mobile phones, on social interaction is a topic of significant debate. While some argue that these devices undermine face-to-face communication, I contend that they are tools that can enhance social connections rather than destroy them.Firstly, mobile phones serve as a bridge for communication, allowing people to stay in touch regardless of geographical distances. Families separated by miles can share moments instantly through texts, calls, or video chats, fostering a sense of closeness that would be difficult to achieve otherwise. For instance, a student studying abroad can maintain regular contact with family and friends back home, thus enriching personal relationships despite physical separation.Moreover, mobile technology facilitates the formation of new connections. Social media platforms, accessible through mobile phones, allow users to meet and interact with individuals who share similar interests, hobbies, or goals. This virtual engagement can lead to real-world meetups and friendships, expanding one's social network significantly. In this respect, far from diminishing social interaction, mobile phones can enhance it by introducing users to diverse perspectives and experiences.However, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential drawbacks of mobile phone usage. The allure of virtual interactions may lead to a decline in face-to-face engagements, resulting in superficial connections. People can become engrossed in their screens, missing opportunities for meaningful interactions in their immediate surroundings. This concern emphasizes the need for a balanced approach to technology usage.In conclusion, while mobile phones can distract from in-person communication, they ultimately serve as powerful enablers of social interaction. When used wisely, these devices can strengthen existing relationships, foster new ones, and create a more interconnected world. The key lies in striking a balance between digital and physical interactions to ensure that technology enhances rather than detracts from our social lives.
337;Modern forms of communication such as email and messaging have reduced the amount of time people spend seeing their friends. This has had a negative effect on their social lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Undoubtedly, the movement of modern forms of communication has changed better, which help people to interact to others, such as email and messaging without limitation time. I totally agree that using of these soft devices have cut much of time people need to see with their relatives. However, it is had some demerits on their social lives.Mentioned to societies life style, they constantly use these kinds of electronic letter for making fellowship or just continuing theirs what they already had. Obviousness, there are other ways like social media that they could to use it for meeting theirs buddies such as Twitter and Facebook, also make the communication become feasible and limitless of time.Another perspective, using of these facilities has influenced netizens to keep themselves becoming unsociable. It caused they were swept away by virtual atmosphere, so they do not do much social live interactions with others. The consequence of this case made some people become geek, as too much of using email and messaging, without direct contacts. However, people have had own minded to keep connection with their friends as a good relationship, meet them and talk by face to face directly.In conclusion, I admittedly and strongly agree that the merits of email and messaging have reduced amount of ours time to communicate to. Besides, we need to make sure for the real gathering with our colleague.;In our technologically advanced society, modern forms of communication, such as email and messaging apps, have undeniably transformed the way we interact with others. While these tools offer convenience and efficiency in staying connected, I contend that they have contributed to a decline in the quality of our social lives and reduced the frequency with which we see our friends in person.Firstly, the immediacy provided by messaging platforms often leads to superficial interactions. Text-based communication lacks the nuance of face-to-face conversations—it strips away body language, tone, and emotional depth. Although we can maintain contact with a larger circle of acquaintances, the connections tend to become shallow. As a result, individuals may find themselves engaging in quick exchanges rather than deep, meaningful conversations that foster real friendships. Moreover, the ease of digital communication can result in complacency regarding personal interactions. The convenience of a text can deter individuals from making the effort to meet in person. When a quick message suffices for planning or catching up, the impetus to physically arrange gatherings diminishes. Many friends may find themselves opting for virtual chats over in-person rendezvous, leading to a decline in actual social interactions. Another detrimental effect is the tendency of people to substitute online communication for real-life experiences. Social media platforms can create an illusion of connection, where individuals feel they are socializing while spending hours scrolling through feeds instead of engaging with friends directly. This can foster feelings of isolation, as they might be surrounded by a virtual community yet lack the intimate connections that come from shared experiences.In conclusion, while modern communication methods have their advantages, they have substantially diminished the time people spend with friends and, subsequently, the quality of social interactions. Thus, I agree that these changes have negatively impacted our social lives, emphasizing the importance of maintaining in-person connections to nurture deeper relationships.
338;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Other believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.;"It is undeniable that children have an innocent mind, and they requires a proper guidance at a specific time to make them understand the value of life. Some people think that it is better to make them competitive, while other believes to make them co-operative. Both these factors have their own values, and have been discussed in detail below:Competitive children are more likely to be confident enough to handle the situations independently. This factor initially arises from the school, where teacher encourages student to feel more competitive through the grading system, and this is the place where children are trying to get on the top by scoring the highest marks. This factor will lead them to be successful in their lives ahead, but will also restrict them in many ways. For example, MNCs are mainly focusing on a team work, and a person with the competitive mind would be having a difficulty in managing the situation with the team.However, those who wants to create a sense of co-operation in their children is a symbol that they want to make them sensible enough in their lives ahead. Although, they will not be having a pace and an eager to get on the top as the competitors do, but they shall have an art of managing different situations of life with the help of a team.In my opinion, though competitive children will be far more clever and faster than the co-operative child in an initial level, but it will not help them to be on the success path for the long run; while on the contrary, co-operative child will have a potential of structuring and implementing new and innovative ideas with the help of a team.To conclude, I would say that people should create a sense of co-operation in their children to make them feel more accomplished in life.";The debate over whether competition or cooperation should be emphasized in children's development is a complex one, with valid arguments on both sides. Advocates of fostering a sense of competition in children argue that it instills important life skills such as resilience, ambition, and the drive for excellence. Competitive environments can push children to strive for their best, motivating them to improve their skills and achieve their goals. In sports, for instance, competition encourages teamwork and discipline, as children learn to set personal benchmarks and work toward surpassing them. Such experiences not only build character but also prepare them for a world where competition is often inescapable.On the other hand, proponents of cooperation argue that teaching children to collaborate fosters empathy, social skills, and problem-solving abilities that are essential in today's increasingly interconnected world. Cooperative activities allow children to appreciate diverse perspectives, build relationships, and work toward common goals. In an era where many challenges, such as climate change or public health crises, require collective action, the ability to cooperate and communicate effectively becomes vital. Children who are encouraged to work together are often more adaptable and capable of navigating complex social dynamics in adulthood.In conclusion, while competition can drive individual achievement and personal growth, an environment that promotes cooperation equips children with crucial interpersonal skills. A balanced approach may be the most beneficial, incorporating elements of both competition and cooperation. This way, children develop the resilience to face challenges while also learning the value of collaboration. Ultimately, fostering both qualities can help shape well-rounded adults who can thrive in a competitive world yet understand the importance of working together toward collective success.
339;Nowadays the way many people interact with each other has changed because of technology. In what ways has technology affected the types of relationships people make? Has this become a positive or negative development?;Nowadays, the variety of communication systems used widely. As technology develops, it has negative influences in many respects. However, I strongly agree with that the technology has large positive effects on relationships between people. The main advantage is that technology has enabled people stay in contact with each other more closely. While public use the Internet or smart phone to share information to each other at different positions. Instead of using letters, technology advanced not only gives us more spare time but also convenient and efficient. More, even if family members who are in different countries, they also can use the Internet to connect each others, especially though the images or videos, they can feel close. Furthermore, technology is also essential for students, live in remote districts, shared the valuable natural resources with friends. Another issue is that in the ever-accelerated updating of science and technology, technology provides opportunities for people to establish the social network. In the past, people might have had pen friends in other countries, but now, thanks to the social networking websites, people can easily to find someone who has similar interests. Also, they can connect with friends who have been out of touch for a long time by using the Internet. In this way, technology is beneficial to humanity develops positive relationships. In conclusion, I agree with that the technology has more optimal effects on people's interaction, because it helps ordinary people to make new friends and to maintain relationships.;"In recent years, the proliferation of technology has significantly transformed the way people interact and form relationships. From social media platforms to instant messaging apps, technology has reshaped the landscape of communication, introducing both opportunities and challenges for interpersonal connections.One of the most notable impacts of technology is the facilitation of long-distance relationships. Individuals can now maintain connections across vast geographical boundaries, fostering relationships that would have been nearly impossible in a pre-digital age. Platforms like Zoom and WhatsApp have enabled real-time communication, allowing friends and family members to share experiences, despite being miles apart. Additionally, online dating applications have revolutionized the dating scene, allowing people to meet potential partners beyond their immediate social circles, which can lead to diverse and intercultural relationships.However, the shift towards digital interactions has also resulted in some negative consequences for interpersonal relationships. Many individuals experience a sense of isolation despite being constantly connected online. The preference for texting over face-to-face interactions can hinder the development of deeper emotional connections, as non-verbal cues that are essential for understanding one another are often lost in digital communication. Moreover, the curated nature of social media profiles can lead to unrealistic expectations and comparisons, resulting in feelings of inadequacy among users.In conclusion, technology has brought forth a dual-edged sword in the realm of relationships. While it has undoubtedly expanded opportunities for connection and interaction across diverse backgrounds, it also risks trivializing the depth of those connections and promoting superficial engagements. Balancing the benefits and drawbacks of technology in our relationships is crucial. Ultimately, the impact of technology on interpersonal relationships may vary depending on how it is used; it can lead to either enriched connections or conversely, a decline in the quality of interactions."
340;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;With the development of technology, whether or not it is still necessary to protect the traditional skills and lifestyles leads to a drastic controversy which is becoming a public concern, especially considering the significant impact taken by technology. As far as I am concerned, the importance of traditions should be valued and paid attention to.Traditional skills and lifestyles play important role in modern society, in terms of healthcare, environmental protection and cultural inherit. Although technology takes convenience to humankind, it also contributes to unhealthy behaviors of life, like sedentary lifestyle. Instead, traditional ways of life is a great complimentary for modern life and highlight the importance of work life balance. Meanwhile, due to the fact that traditional skills rely little on fossil energy, it is more environmentally-friendly, which should be promoted to reduce the threat of climate change. Furthermore those tradition-related things convey traditional culture and values. These are important foundation of modern civilization. Protection of tradition can provide the possibility to better understand ancient culture and utilize them to tackle modern problems.Some people who hold different viewpoints may advocate that protecting traditions consume too much financial budget compared with the incoming it takes. In spite of the fact this kind of business bring limited contribution to government finance, it should be emphasized that the expense is trivial compared with the potential value of traditions. Therefore the government authorities and education institutes should work closely together to promote the traditional skills and ways of life, so as to make people to realize the value of them.All in all, protection of tradition is not only important for the entire society currently, but also contributes to the next generation.;The assertion that technological advancement leads to the inevitable demise of traditional skills and ways of life is a complex one, warranting careful consideration. While it is true that modernizing influences can challenge traditional practices, it is overly simplistic to deem the preservation of these practices as pointless.On one hand, proponents of technology argue that innovation brings about efficiency and improved quality of life. For instance, automation in agriculture allows for higher yields and less manual labor, which seemingly renders traditional farming techniques obsolete. However, this perspective fails to recognize the inherent value of these skills. Traditional methods often carry cultural significance and a deep connection to the identity of a community. Many societies rely on these practices not just for sustenance, but also as a way to maintain heritage and cohesion.Moreover, the juxtaposition of technology and tradition does not have to be a zero-sum game. In fact, many cultures are finding ways to integrate modern technology with traditional practices. For example, farmers may utilize smart agricultural tools while still employing organic methods passed down through generations. This fusion can enhance productivity without completely erasing the methods that characterize a culture.Additionally, as the world confronts challenges such as climate change, there is a growing appreciation for the sustainable practices that traditional lifestyles often embody. Communities are increasingly valuing indigenous knowledge systems that have thrived for centuries, seeking ways to balance modern innovations with time-honored techniques that are ecologically sound.In conclusion, while technology undeniably transforms societies, the outright abandonment of traditional skills and ways of life is neither inevitable nor desirable. Instead of viewing them as relics of the past, recognizing their relevance and adaptability in today’s world can lead to a more harmonious coexistence of the old and the new.
341;Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to be co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;In present educational system there are variety of competitions in academic area and athletic area for children to attend, which could stimulating the will of children to learn and to achieve the best of them, and also be able to teach them teamwork skill. However, some people think it is better to make children be competitive than cooperative, both the values have its arguments.A strong competition sense helps children having urge to learn or to practice for being the best among peers, and this factor is initially arises from the schools and parents, to encourage children to get the highest scores through the grading system. Even though a competitive child is usually more motivated to pursue a goal or to face difficulties independently, but it is also risky that children are becoming too competitive to cooperating with others. Being competitive leads them to success, but could also restrict them in many ways. For example, it might be hard for a competitive person to deal or manage in a team work project.On the other hand, cooperation is also an essential quality for children, no matter in school activities or in communities. Having a good cooperating spirit helps kids to communicate and get along with others, which gives them more possibility to solve problems or to achieve a goal easily by working as a team. After all, in society, there is hardly anyone who could has big achievement by oneself. For example, famous singers or movie stars, despite of their talent to make them successful, there are always a team to manage works or deal with things.In my point of view, though competitive child would have more motivation and perspective that leads them to success, but it would not help them much once they enter to society or company which required more about skill of team work. To sum up, I would say that schools and adults should put a sense of cooperation in children to make them becoming a useful adult whether in society or community.;The debate surrounding whether competition or cooperation is more beneficial for children's development is a complex one. On one hand, proponents of fostering competition in children argue that it promotes resilience, ambition, and a drive for excellence. Engaging in competitive activities, such as sports, academic contests, and other forms of performance, can instill a sense of achievement and help children learn how to handle successes and failures. The experience of competing also encourages personal growth, as children strive to improve their skills, set goals, and work towards attaining them. Furthermore, a competitive environment can simulate real-world situations where individuals are often vying for limited resources, thereby preparing them for the realities of adult life.Conversely, those in favor of teaching cooperation argue that working collaboratively fosters essential life skills such as teamwork, empathy, and communication. In today's interconnected world, the ability to cooperate effectively with others is crucial for success in various fields, from corporate environments to community initiatives. Advocates of cooperation suggest that when children are taught to prioritize collaboration over competition, they are more likely to contribute positively to society as adults. They believe that collaboration promotes inclusivity and reduces feelings of isolation or inadequacy, which can often stem from competitive pressures.In my opinion, both competition and cooperation have their merits, but a balanced approach seems most effective. Encouraging a healthy sense of competition can motivate children to strive for personal excellence, while teaching cooperation equips them with the social skills necessary for collaborative success in adulthood. Ideally, educational and social frameworks should embrace opportunities that allow children to learn from competition while also emphasizing the importance of working together towards common goals. Striking this balance will prepare children to navigate the complexities of adult life, making them both competent and cooperative individuals.
342;Some people think that advertising give more harms than good to our society. Other refute this. Discuss both views and give your opinion;On these days, with the assistance of advertisement, people easily purchase the best products with detailed information and instruction for their requirement. Although some people claim that the advantages of advertising are outweigh the advantages, I believe that advertisement bring more benefits than harms to our lives.On the one hand, it is clear that most advertisements so exaggerate the quality of their products that they often ignore some negative effects of what they sell. In addition to this, all of things are advertised as the best ones result in the confusing for users in picking out the most suitable goods. For example, some kinds of shampoo, namely Sunsilk, Clear, Dove are publicized as magic items to recreate injured hair with the number of other benefits. However, the fact is that not all customers are satisfied with what they bought under the introduction from advertisement. On the other hand, it is undeniable fact that advertising market gives lots of working opportunities from producers, writers to models and cameramen for all of people as long as their qualification adapt to the demands. Moreover, advertisement enables to support users in getting accustomed to enterprises and know thoroughly items sold from these producers. Take Coca cola for an example, this drinking firm is well-known as one of companies invested a major part of their money in advertising. No wonder why this drinking title becomes more and more familiar with customers around the world. Last but not least, online advertisement is one of the easiest approaches due to their potential gains such as cheaper cost, convenience and easily observing.To sum up, everything has its own gains and losses and advertisement is not an exception. From my point of view, advertising will be better if producers and advertisers are more honest in producing advertisements to give people the general view on one product.;Advertising is a ubiquitous part of modern society, playing a significant role in shaping consumer behavior, public awareness, and cultural norms. However, the debate over whether advertising does more harm than good is a nuanced one, with valid arguments on both sides.Proponents of advertising argue that it serves several beneficial purposes. Firstly, it informs consumers about new products and services, enabling them to make informed choices. From innovative technologies to health products, advertising can play a key role in educating the public. Secondly, advertising can foster competition among businesses, leading to better quality products and services at competitive prices. Furthermore, advertising is a substantial source of funding for various media platforms, allowing for the production of diverse content and supporting economic growth.Conversely, critics contend that advertising often promotes consumerism and materialism, leading to negative social implications. It can create unrealistic expectations and desires, fostering dissatisfaction with one's life and possessions. For instance, advertisements frequently portray an idealized lifestyle that is unattainable for many, instilling feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. Additionally, there are ethical concerns surrounding advertising practices, especially when it comes to targeted marketing towards vulnerable populations, such as children. Such tactics can manipulate impressionable minds and lead to unhealthy habits, such as poor dietary choices or substance misuse.In my opinion, while advertising has its merits in terms of economic benefits and consumer information, the potential for harm—especially in the realm of mental health and societal values—cannot be overlooked. It is essential for regulatory frameworks to be put in place to ensure ethical advertising practices that prioritize consumer welfare over profit. Striking a balance between the benefits of advertising and its possible negative impacts is crucial for fostering a more informed and healthier society.
343;Some modern artists receive huge sums of money for the things they create, while other struggle to survive. Government should take steps to resolve this unfair situation. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;"The amount of money people earning sometimes is unfair. In a field of art, modern artist may receive high salary for their masterpiece creation while labors should be break their bone for years to get similar amount of money. Although some people view that government should be take a responsibility for this unfair situation, critics against such view. I agree that in this occasion the government is not granted to hand in.Proficiency brings perfectness in terms of art work. It is true while the modern artists who implement their creative thinking onto high value creation are paid with immense sum by the art collector. Also, the high sum which modern artists receive is related to the quality instead of the quantity and their rare talent. For example, a 15 centimeter Buddha temple made by hand is granted times in comparison with factory production. On the other hand, modern artists also devote themselves find a unique concept in which ordinary people cannot do, such making impossible become possible. Pieter Padang, Minion creator, has brilliant idea to alter part of song lyric ""I swear"" become ""underwear"" when the Minion sing in Despicable Me. He granted huge sums for such idea.Striking contrast, labor working in the merchandise factory receive coin of dollar even they make a hundred of 15 cm Buddha temples a day. In any case, a musician playing ""I swear"" several times receives different earnings that Padang got because the musician re-plays the song without any creation. Moreover, government cannot equalize the price of creation of modern artist because there is no certain parameter to value it, art value is about taste.Having said that the huge sums of modern artists receives related to their struggle in the field of art, while the term of struggle might different with other field of job. I agree that government cannot take steps to make the salary between modern artists and other job similar because art price is about taste.";The disparity in earnings among modern artists is a complex issue that reflects broader societal values and market dynamics. While some artists command astonishing prices for their work, others find it increasingly difficult to make a living in a competitive landscape. This situation raises questions about fairness and sustainability in the arts, leading to the suggestion that government intervention is necessary to rectify these imbalances.On one hand, the art market is heavily influenced by trends, demand, and speculation. High-profile auctions can drive prices to astronomical levels, creating a scenario where a handful of artists benefit wildly from their work. This often leads to the perception that talent alone determines success, while many other artists – equally skilled and passionate – struggle to gain recognition or financial support. In this light, it seems unjust for the art community to operate under such imbalances, particularly when creative expression is essential to cultural and social discourse.On the other hand, one could argue that the art market, like any marketplace, operates best when driven by supply and demand. Government intervention might disrupt the natural flow of artistic expression and valuation. Moreover, direct intervention could inadvertently stifle creativity, leading to a 'one-size-fits-all' model that fails to recognize the unique contributions of individual artists.Nevertheless, I believe there is a role for government to play in mitigating these disparities. Initiatives such as grants, subsidies, tax incentives for emerging artists, and funding for art education could enhance opportunities for those struggling financially. By investing in the arts more broadly, governments can promote a diverse range of artistic voices and ensure a healthier ecosystem for all creators.In conclusion, while the art market is inherently unpredictable, government action can provide a necessary balance to foster equal opportunities for artists at all levels. By addressing the inequities in artistic compensation, we foster a richer cultural landscape that values and elevates the contributions of every artist.
344;People tend to work longer hours nowadays. Working long hours has a negative effect on themselves, their families and the society, so working hours should be restricted. Do you agree or disagree?;"Working longer hours is becoming prevalent in these days. There is a saying in my native village, ""Health is Wealth"". I believe many of people including me are not really considering the importance of health. The need for increased working hours might be because of enhanced competitive environment and desire to acquire much money and promotion. However, people working for extended hours have been found having adverse effects on their health and personal life. In my opinion, a balance between personal and professional life should be created by restricting maximum number of working hours. First of all, many of us would agree to the fact that people; who prefer working longer hours, do not find time to focus on their health. By working too long, they often become tired, lazy and reluctant to carry out physical exercise in order to remain fit and healthy and eventually loose health and become sick. Moreover, they become extensively addicted to their work and become workaholic type persons. The repercussion are so severe that their families and friends remain deprived off their attention and in the end they end up losing balance between their family and personal life.Secondly, these workaholic people do not spend time for the contribution of society by actively participating in any social campaign. As they usually remain busy in their office so they do not find leisure time for such social activities. For instance, I would take my boss's example; he has been working for extended hours in office for many years. Recently, his health and personal life was drastically affected as he broke up with his wife and his family life has totally been in chaos and cries. He started regretting afterwards and now trying to manage his work but it seems to be too late for him.To conclude this, I would strongly emphasis and recommend, Government must include the clause of maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce to all companies for ensuring their employees do not spend extended hours in companies. This will help in uplift of society, and bring the lost equilibrium between personal and professional life of each individual person.";In recent years, there has been a noticeable trend of longer working hours, with many individuals spending more time at their jobs than ever before. While some may argue that this increased dedication to work can lead to greater productivity and economic growth, I firmly believe that the negative repercussions of working long hours surpass any potential benefits. These adverse effects not only impact individuals but also extend to their families and society as a whole, making a compelling case for the need to restrict working hours.Firstly, working excessively long hours can take a substantial toll on an individual's health and well-being. Chronic overwork is linked to a variety of health issues, including stress, anxiety, and even cardiovascular diseases. When employees are constantly exhausted, their physical and mental health suffers, leading to reduced efficiency at work and increased absenteeism. This cycle not only impacts the individual but can also place an additional burden on healthcare systems, highlighting the broader societal implications of overwork.Moreover, long working hours can strain family relationships. Individuals who dedicate excessive time to their jobs often miss important family events and fail to foster meaningful connections with loved ones. This disconnect can lead to a deterioration of family bonds and contribute to issues such as neglect or increased conflict within the family unit. Consequently, the fabric of society begins to fray, as strong family units are essential for nurturing future generations.Finally, the pressure to work long hours fosters a culture of overachievement that glorifies busyness, which can perpetuate a cycle of unhappiness and dissatisfaction. By imposing restrictions on working hours, we can foster a healthier work-life balance that enhances overall quality of life, promotes stronger familial connections, and contributes positively to society at large.In conclusion, the detrimental effects of long working hours on individuals, families, and society cannot be underestimated. Therefore, I strongly advocate for the imposition of restrictions on working hours to ensure a healthier, more balanced, and ultimately more effective workforce.
345;A successful person is one who has earned a lot of money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;It's such a common definition of a successful person is one who has earned a lot of money, especially in nowadays society. Each individual visualize success differently. Still, my term of a successful man is one who has certain achievements in life rather than the one with a high income.Money is undeniably pivotal, but ways of earning it is also various. A person's great prosperity does not state that he has gained it ethically by himself. Nevertheless, a man can only achieve his accomplishment through hard-working, dedication and passion. Whether it is a personal or a social achievement, that man is laudable.More importantly, the more beneficial for the society his achievement is, the more successful he is considered. For instance, Thomas Edison is undeniably considered as one of the greatest inventors in the 20th century since his invention's productivity is countless useful for mankind. On the other hand, the fact of knowing a man's utilization of his money remains in the dark. Therefore, judging a person by his income is difficult, especially in the success aspect.In conclusion, using only money as a scale to measure a man's success is impossible despite the fact that it is the essential in basic needs. Yet, it is the common scene that a man can be publicly considered successful when his achievements, which can only accomplished by passion, dedication and ethics, are helpful not only for himself.;"The notion of success is often intertwined with financial wealth; however, the perspective that a successful person is solely defined by their monetary earnings is an oversimplification of a complex concept. While financial achievement can be an indicator of success, it is not the sole criterion by which one should measure it.Firstly, success is multifaceted and highly subjective. For some individuals, particularly those in altruistic professions or personal endeavors, success might mean making a significant impact on the lives of others rather than accumulating wealth. For example, teachers, social workers, and healthcare professionals often work long hours for modest salaries, yet their contributions to society are invaluable. In this light, many would argue that their success is measured by the positive change they create rather than their bank balances.Moreover, personal fulfillment and fulfillment of life goals often play a crucial role in defining success. An individual may be content with their modest lifestyle, enjoying time with family, engaging in meaningful relationships, or pursuing hobbies they are passionate about. These elements contribute to a person's overall happiness and life satisfaction, which arguably constitute true success. In contrast, a wealthy individual who is unhappy or lacking personal connections may feel unfulfilled despite their financial status.Additionally, the pursuit of money can sometimes lead to negative consequences such as increased stress, unhealthy competition, or ethical dilemmas. Thus, equating success solely with monetary wealth could inadvertently promote a culture that prioritizes financial gain over integrity, creativity, and emotional well-being.In conclusion, while financial success is an important aspect for many, it is not the definitive measure of a successful person. Success should encompass a broader range of factors including personal growth, impact on society, and overall happiness. True success is a harmonious balance between wealth, fulfillment, and contributing positively to the world around us."
346;Question: Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which there are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowdays, people's choice of consumption is heavily affected by various of advertising on television, street, magazine etc. This argument may be true that people will be swayed by the advertising and buy things they do not need it for their life. For example, in most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs.In addition, products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought. A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society. And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it.However, buying habit is a very personal things for individuals, the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy, sometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption. It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income. Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase. On the other hand, children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not, since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary.In my opinion, I think buying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements. But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising. So it is important that government needs to impose rules on particularly advertisement company (for example, toys company) to avoid youngster have bias thought on what they really need.;The assertion that high sales of popular consumer goods primarily reflect the power of advertising rather than the real needs of society invites a nuanced examination of consumer behavior and the influences that shape purchasing decisions. While it is undeniable that advertising plays a pivotal role in driving consumer sales, it is reductive to disregard the underlying societal needs that also inform these purchases.Firstly, advertising undoubtedly wields significant influence over consumer choices. Through a myriad of channels—television, social media, print, and even experiential marketing—advertisers skillfully construct narratives that resonate with the emotions, aspirations, and lifestyles of potential buyers. Well-crafted campaigns can create perceived needs, making products appear essential to everyday life or social status. For instance, smartphone manufacturers often market their products as must-haves, suggesting that owning the latest model is critical for social belonging and success. This can lead to a surge in sales, often transcending actual necessity.However, it is equally important to recognize that consumption is not solely driven by advertising. Many purchases are grounded in real needs, which can be influenced by factors such as economic conditions, cultural shifts, and technological advancements. For instance, the increasing sales of electric vehicles reflect a societal shift towards sustainability. This phenomenon is driven not just by aggressive marketing but also by a growing public awareness of climate change and the desire for cleaner modes of transportation. In this context, consumer goods often address tangible needs aligned with societal values, rather than being mere products of advertising prowess.In conclusion, while advertising undeniably amplifies sales through its persuasive capabilities, it operates alongside genuine societal needs that shape consumer behavior. A balanced perspective acknowledges the interplay between marketing influence and the real demands of society, illustrating that high sales can be a reflection of both advertising power and an evolving understanding of consumer necessities.
347;Some people think that by paying taxes they made enough contribution to their society. TO what extent do you agree or disagree? ;Paying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country. Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that. Personally, I tend to disagree with this view.To start with, all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government, as it is the most important source of government's revenue, which is mainly used to serve all citizens. For example, a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability, so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment. The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers. Although these workers do not produce profit directly, what they do is for the well-being of the whole society.However, I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax. As we know, there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others. It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, but such financial help is usually far from enough. In such case, aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support. Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force. There are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited. So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department.In conclusion, it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government. Other than that, they have other critical obligations to take, in order to make our society function in an ordered way.;The relationship between taxation and societal contribution is complex and multifaceted, prompting varied opinions on the extent to which paying taxes constitutes a sufficient contribution to society. While taxes indeed play a vital role in funding public services and infrastructure, I argue that viewing taxation as the sole measure of contribution overlooks other significant avenues for civic engagement.Firstly, taxes are essential for the functioning of a society. They finance schools, hospitals, roads, and public safety, enabling communities to thrive. Individuals who pay taxes are undoubtedly supporting the collective welfare of their society. However, this financial contribution does not encompass the entirety of civic responsibility. Moreover, active participation in the community—through volunteer work, local governance, or social advocacy—also defines one’s contribution to society. Such activities involve investing time and effort into improving the lives of others, fostering social connections, and building a sense of belonging. For instance, volunteering at a local shelter or participating in community clean-up initiatives directly impacts the social fabric, enhancing community cohesion in ways that monetary contributions cannot.Additionally, civic engagement, such as voting or participating in town hall meetings, empowers citizens to influence decisions that affect their lives and communities. This active involvement amplifies the voice of the community, ensuring that diverse perspectives are considered in governance.In conclusion, while paying taxes is indeed a crucial element of societal contribution, it should not be viewed in isolation. To fully enrich society, individuals must engage in a variety of activities that promote social well-being. Therefore, I contend that a holistic approach to civic responsibility encompasses both financial contributions and active participation in the community, creating a more dynamic and responsive society.
348;School should teach children the academic subje cts which have a close relationship with their future careers, so other subjects like music and sports are not important. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"People have many different views about what subjects should be taught in school. Although I accept that students have to study many subjects in school, I disagree with the idea that unimportant subjects such as music and sports should be got rid of the program.Many people believe that students only need to study academic subjects like mathematics, physics because these subject are necessary for students' future. This is understandable when labor market now has high competition; students have to meet requirements regard of qualification. In addition, the unemployment rate is always high, so their parents want children to study these subjects which can help students have a job. Although those above reasons are acceptable, I would argue that there are many things much more important than having a job. Firstly, studying music, art or sports is also very important to students. This enables students to develop their potentials through discovering the natural world around them. Secondly, to get a job in labor market, not only do students require hard skills but also soft skills such as teamwork, presentation. For instance, through taking part in a sport, students can understand team spirit and learn lessons about teamwork skills. Therefore, these subjects might fulfil the students' ability. Finally, children's future do not depend heavily on the academic subjects they study in school, it is the result of their efforts and capacity.In conclusion, although the academic subjects play a primary role in nurturing children, it seem to me that the effects of learning music, sports are profound.";The debate surrounding the focus of school curricula often centers on whether academic subjects directly related to future careers should take precedence over others like music and sports. While it is undeniable that subjects such as mathematics, science, and technology are critical for students entering specialized fields, I would argue that a well-rounded education, including music and sports, is equally important for holistic development.Firstly, subjects that correspond closely to future careers, such as mathematics or computer science, provide essential skills and knowledge needed in today's job market. For example, understanding data analytics is vital for careers in finance and technology. Therefore, prioritizing these subjects seems logical from a pragmatic standpoint. However, fully concentrating on career-oriented subjects neglects the diverse abilities and talents each child possesses.Moreover, music and sports play a significant role in developing essential life skills that are beneficial regardless of one’s career path. Participation in sports teaches teamwork, discipline, and resilience, which are qualities valued by employers across all sectors. Similarly, music education enhances creativity and cognitive skills, contributing to improved problem-solving abilities. Additionally, exposure to the arts fosters emotional intelligence and cultural awareness, qualities increasingly recognized as important in a globalized world.Furthermore, a narrow focus on academic subjects can lead to increased stress and burnout among students. Including music and sports in the curriculum offers essential outlets for self-expression and stress relief, promoting overall well-being. In conclusion, while it is important for schools to equip students with knowledge relevant to their future careers, it is equally crucial to include subjects like music and sports in the educational framework. A balanced curriculum that nurtures both academic skills and personal growth ultimately prepares children not just for their careers, but for life as well.
349;Some people believe that information available in the internet will end the era of newspapers and magazines. Do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion and examples.;Digital media has been extremely popular among people around the globe. With this advancement, newspapers and magazines are struggling to justify their existence. Some believe that traditional paper media will come to an end very soon due to the increased usage of internet based media. But many other still thinks they are going to stay. I agree to the argument that newspapers and magazines will be history with the time. I will establish my view by analysing how internet presents the information about the current affair so fast and the accessibility to the historical news.A very important responsibility of media is to publish information about the current affairs as quickly as possible specially when there is a crisis. This helps readers to get updated and act accordingly. For example, when the aircraft MH 370 went missing, everyone wanted to know the details about this tragic incident. The friends and families of passengers and crews were impatient to know the truth. In such situations, newspapers and magazines can not respond as fast as digital media. Instead of waiting for next publication, people can get trustworthy information about the current incidents from internet within an hour or two. This explains why digital media will rule over paper and magazines.People often want to access news from past for various reasons like to prepare for research, satisfy interest, etc. For example, one research fellow may want to know how a small village named Oramaki in Japan was suffering after Second World War. It is very difficult to get this sort of information from past in newspapers and magazines as one has to know before where to look at. But internet provides efficient search facility where one can search the topic and get the details. This feature of digital media is not supported by newspapers and magazines.To conclude, the fast responding internet media with vast information will be replacing newspapers and magazines as new and information provider for valid reasons. Though considering the current infrastructure and mindset of people, paper media will continue for another few years.;The advent of the internet has undeniably transformed how we consume information, generating a heated debate about whether it will ultimately lead to the decline of traditional newspapers and magazines. While I acknowledge the profound impact of digital information on journalism, I argue that it will not completely end the era of print media but will rather lead to its evolution.Firstly, online platforms offer unmatched immediacy and accessibility. News can be updated in real time, catering to the fast-paced demands of our society. For instance, during significant events like elections or natural disasters, digital media can provide instant updates, which print newspapers cannot match. This immediacy has captivated the audience, particularly younger generations who lean towards short, visually engaging content often found online.However, in this age of information overload, the appeal of thoughtfully curated content remains significant. Many readers value the depth and quality of journalism that newspapers and magazines provide. Long-form articles, investigative pieces, and expert opinions often require thorough research and careful editing—elements that many online outlets struggle to maintain due to the pressure for speed. For example, publications like The New Yorker and The Economist continue to thrive, drawing audiences willing to pay for high-quality journalism that offers in-depth analysis not typically available online.Moreover, print media engages readers in a tactile way that digital formats cannot replicate. The experience of flipping through the pages of a magazine or reading a newspaper with a cup of coffee cannot be easily replaced by scrolling through a screen. This physical presence creates a connection with the content that many still appreciate, fostering a loyal readership that values printed materials.In conclusion, while the internet has reshaped the landscape of information dissemination, it does not signify the end of newspapers and magazines. Instead, these traditional formats will adapt, finding new ways to coexist within a digital world while catering to an audience that values both immediacy and depth.
350;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In many societies, choice of a job depends on the size of the salary offered. Nevertheless, while I admit that the salary is very pivotal factor, I claim that there are other equally vital aspects that need to be considered in this regard.To begin with, I agree that in order for people to cover their daily and general needs they need money as well. However, aspects such as: friendly colleagues, environment and work-place condition, sometimes, have even more impact on person's happiness and quality of life. People, for instance, who don't like their co-workers and working condition are considered less satisfied with their jobs, despite of a high salary. In this sense, it is also one very salient proof of the accuracy of my position.Further and even more importantly, most of the satisfaction of a job comes to people from their professional achievements, skills and the position they reach. In other words, career promotion or getting some kind of credit from the administration of a company or organization are, likely, more enjoyable achievements than getting a high salary. For example, people, who work in monotonous jobs, where no achievements or a new positions can be reached feel themselves more dissatisfied, even though they have a very good salaries.In conclusion, I disagree with the idea that salary outweighs any other motivators, as there are other even more important aspects such as: friendly co-workers, working conditions and professional achievements.;When considering a job, salary is undoubtedly an important factor, but to assert that it is the most critical consideration oversimplifies the complexity of job selection. While financial compensation plays a significant role in meeting basic needs and providing a comfortable lifestyle, it is not the sole determinant of job satisfaction and career fulfillment.First and foremost, while a high salary can provide financial security and the ability to enjoy life’s amenities, job satisfaction stems from various non-monetary factors as well. Elements such as workplace culture, opportunities for career development, job fulfillment, work-life balance, and an individual’s passion for their work are vital in fostering a satisfying career. For instance, a highly paid job that comes with excessive stress, long hours, and little personal time may ultimately lead to burnout, making it less desirable than a lower-paying role that promotes a healthy work-life balance and personal growth.Moreover, job stability and security are crucial considerations that often accompany salary packages. Many high-paying jobs come with high stakes and pressures that can jeopardize one’s job security. In contrast, a stable position with a moderate salary can provide peace of mind and long-lasting career sustainability. Additionally, one’s values and personal ambitions significantly shape career choices. Many individuals prioritize meaningful work or positions that align with their ethical standards over a lucrative salary. For instance, educators, social workers, and healthcare professionals often choose their fields for the impact they can have on society, despite the relatively modest compensation.In conclusion, while salary is undeniably an essential factor when choosing a job, it should not dominate the decision-making process. A holistic approach, considering various aspects such as job satisfaction, work environment, and personal values, is imperative to achieving long-term fulfillment in one’s career.
351;Using a computer every day can have more negative than positive effects on children. Do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, computer is an essential part of everyday life. Around the globe, the effect is evident on children also. It is disagreed that computer can affect children in a negative way if they use a computer on a daily basis. This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers.The best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text, image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about. As an example, students preparing for delivering speech on a certain topic can browse through internet to learn each and every minute details of the subject matter. It's hard to get everything at a same place unless children are not familiar with computers. That is how, computer impacts children on a positive note.Nowadays, computers enable people to prepare presentations, draw complex graphs and pictures, document thesis in a simple though efficient way. When children are allowed to play around with computer from a very early age, they get acquainted with the previously mentioned skills and become expert before facing professional world. For instance, students who used to prepare Microsoft PowerPoint presentation for their school projects, get an edge over others at an early stage of their career. From this, it's clear that computer has a positive effect on the children.Following the demonstration of a computer's contribution in children's study and building skills which are to be used in their career afterwards, it is agreed that computer is a boon to children. However, parents should advise and guide their children properly so that they don't get misled.;The pervasive use of computers in children’s daily lives has sparked a contentious debate, with many arguing that the negative effects outweigh the positive. While computers undeniably offer educational resources and foster connectivity, I contend that their daily use introduces more detrimental repercussions.To begin with, excessive computer use can adversely affect children’s physical health. Spending long hours in front of screens leads to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to issues such as obesity and poor posture. The allure of video games and online entertainment often supersedes outdoor activities, which are essential for healthy physical development.Moreover, computers can have significant impacts on mental health. The pressure of social media to present a curated, idealized life can lead to anxiety, low self-esteem, and depression. Children may also experience cyberbullying, which has become increasingly prevalent in the digital age. These negative social interactions can hinder their emotional growth and lead to long-term psychological issues.In addition, the cognitive implications of daily computer use are concerning. Habitual reliance on technology can impair attention spans and critical thinking skills. Children may become accustomed to instant gratification that technology provides, diminishing their ability to engage in deep, reflective thought. Such mental shortcuts may hinder academic performance and creativity.Moreover, the potential for addiction to screens creates barriers to family bonding and interpersonal relationships. When children are absorbed in their computers, they miss valuable opportunities for face-to-face interaction, which is crucial for developing social skills and emotional intelligence.In conclusion, while computers undeniably serve educational and communicative purposes, their daily use amongst children poses more negative implications than positive. The potential for physical health issues, mental health challenges, diminished cognitive development, and weakened interpersonal relationships underscores the need for moderation and mindful usage in the digital era.
352;Children who are brought up in families that do not have large amounts of money are better prepared to deal with the problems of adult life than children brought up by wealthy parents. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;According to some people, child who is brought up in less well-off family is more quick-witted and can tackle with an adult life problems better than who is from affluent ones. However, I completely disagree with this position.To begin with, children from poorer families are prone to have bad habits such as: crime, thievery and thuggery. Moreover, these people will not have an access to a good education. As a result, they can be proselytized into bad isms. For example, most of the terroristic groups try to attract uneducated people, because the person with better education has a wider outlook, which will allow no brainwash. In this sense, people with lower level of education have more proneness to be attracted in such isms.Nevertheless, people who are born in well-off families have access to good education, which will have a positive impact on their later life. Secondly, children from rich families have better skills on how to use money, because they use it a lot of times. Finally, wealthy families can afford better health services and costly medicines, which will be very beneficial for the health of a child. For instance, many good medicines cost vast amounts of money, which cannot be afforded by poorer families.In conclusion, I disagree with the opinion that children who are brought up in less well-of families are, likely, more successful in the future life due to aforementioned reasons.;The assertion that children raised in economically disadvantaged families are better equipped to handle the challenges of adult life than those from affluent backgrounds is a complex topic that merits careful examination. While there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe that children from less wealthy families may indeed develop certain skills and resilience that can better prepare them for adult life.Children from financially constrained backgrounds often face a variety of challenges that can foster personal growth and resourcefulness. These challenges might include limited access to material possessions, leading them to cultivate skills such as creativity and problem-solving. For instance, when faced with scarcity, these children learn to make the best out of what they have, which can translate into adaptability and innovation in adulthood. They also tend to develop a strong work ethic, understanding the value of hard work as they witness their parents striving to provide for the family.Moreover, children from lower-income families may develop greater empathy and social awareness. Navigating a world filled with economic disparities can instill a sense of gratitude and a desire to contribute positively to society. They are often more attuned to the challenges faced by others, which can result in a compassionate outlook and a commitment to social justice.Conversely, it is essential to acknowledge that children from wealthy families may also benefit from certain advantages that can ease their transition into adulthood. Financial security often provides access to better educational opportunities, networking connections, and experiences that can enhance personal development. However, these advantages can sometimes lead to entitlement or a lack of resilience when facing obstacles.In conclusion, while both backgrounds have their unique challenges and opportunities, I argue that children from less affluent families may emerge with a stronger foundation for navigating adult life, thanks to the resilience, empathy, and resourcefulness they often develop. Ultimately, the ability to thrive in adulthood is influenced by a multitude of factors beyond financial status, including personal character, support systems, and individual experiences.
353;Many of the medical problems that people are experiencing in today's world are due to the fact that we have a very sedentary lifestyle. To what extend do you agree or disagree.;It is certainly true that modern people are facing up to a new health problems and ailments than before. Many people claim that it is because of sedentary lifestlyle. However, while I accept that sedentary lifestyle is one of the key factors, I believe that some other factors are having even a greater impact.To begin with, I agree that sedentary lifestyle lead to many serious health problems. The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology. In earlier times, for instance, even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities. Nowadays people, especially inhabitants of cities, are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools.Nevertheless, there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems. Firstly, the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses. Many people, for example, are suffering from allergy because of these gasses. Secondly, foods with a low quality such as fast foods, junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively. Finally, life becoming more stressful due to some recent problems such as traffic gam, traffic accidents and others.Given these evidences, it can be seen that people are facing up with many recently appeared illnesses due to aforementioned reasons.;The correlation between sedentary lifestyles and rising medical problems is increasingly recognized in contemporary society. As technology advances and conveniences multiply, physical activity often takes a back seat, prompting many health experts to raise alarms about the consequences of prolonged inactivity. I firmly agree that many medical issues prevalent today, such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and even mental health disorders, can be attributed to a sedentary lifestyle.First and foremost, the prevalence of desk jobs and excessive screen time contribute significantly to decreased physical activity. Many individuals now spend hours working at computers or engaging with smartphones and televisions, leading to a decline in daily movement. According to the World Health Organization, physical inactivity is identified as a leading risk factor for global mortality. The resulting weight gain from insufficient exercise can lead to obesity, which is a precursor to numerous chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes and heart disease.Additionally, sedentary lifestyles can negatively impact mental health. A lack of physical activity has been linked to higher levels of anxiety and depression. Exercise promotes the release of endorphins, which enhance overall mood and wellbeing. When individuals are predominantly inactive, they miss the psychological benefits of regular physical activity, potentially exacerbating mental health issues.Moreover, the sedentary behavior often ingrained in modern life has social implications. People are less likely to engage in communal activities that promote not only physical health but also social interactions, which are critical for improving mental health.In conclusion, I strongly believe that the rise in medical problems can be significantly traced back to sedentary lifestyles. Promoting regular physical activity while discouraging prolonged inactivity is essential for improving health outcomes and enhancing the quality of life in our increasingly sedentary world. Thus, a cultural shift towards valuing movement over immobility is crucial for combating the medical challenges we face today.
354;Foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten. Do you agree or disagree?;"Educational institutions have different systems when it comes to introducing foreign languages to children. Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school. However, those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years. This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children's learning. I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten.To begin with, children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years. Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to. Moreover, teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning. Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language, so quality education will be delivered. Nevertheless, it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners, and the best time to hone them is in their younger years. The introduction of foreign language will be new to them; however, their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend. In this way, grasping a new language will be natural to them. In addition, the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers. Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years. It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages.In conclusion, the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people; however, there are those who disagree. I am totally convinced that if this endeavour is properly implemented by schools, this will most likely lead to improvement of learning ability among children.";"The debate surrounding when to introduce foreign language instruction in educational settings has gained significant attention. Many experts advocate for beginning language education as early as kindergarten, a stance I fully support. The reasons for this perspective are multi-faceted, encompassing cognitive, social, and cultural benefits.To begin with, research indicates that young children are inherently more adept at acquiring new languages than adults. At this developmental stage, their brains are highly plastic, which allows for greater ease in grasping new sounds, grammar structures, and vocabularies. Early exposure to a foreign language can lead to near-native pronunciation and fluency, skills that become increasingly difficult to achieve later in life. By incorporating language learning in kindergarten, we are capitalizing on this critical window of linguistic opportunity.Furthermore, foreign language instruction at an early age promotes cognitive development. Studies have shown that bilingual children often exhibit enhanced problem-solving skills, creativity, and multitasking abilities. Learning a new language requires students to think critically about different structures and meanings, fostering a more adaptable and innovative mindset. Such skills are invaluable in our increasingly interconnected world, where cross-cultural communication is paramount.Socially, early foreign language instruction encourages cultural appreciation and sensitivity. Children who learn a new language from a young age are often more open-minded and better equipped to engage with diverse communities. They develop empathy and a broader worldview, qualities essential for nurturing a more harmonious global society.While there are logistical challenges to implementing foreign language programs in kindergarten, such as training teachers and aligning curricula, the long-term benefits outweigh these concerns. By fostering foreign language education at this formative stage, we are not merely teaching children a new means of communication; we are preparing them to thrive in a multicultural world. For these reasons, I firmly believe that foreign language instruction should begin in kindergarten."
355;International tourism has become a huge industry in the world. Some people think that the problems caused by international tourism outweigh benefits. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the advancement of long-distance transportation, international tourism has boomed in the last few decades. Some people believe that this has brought more problems than benefits. I disagree with this view.I admit that tourism can have a negative impact on the natural environment. In order to meet the needs of tourists, local governments are likely to build more facilities and infrastructures around tourist attractions, which may result in the destruction of natural habitats. Tourism also creates more pollution and waste, including growing emission of greenhouse gases, dumped leftovers and overuse of water, power and other kind of energy in luxurious hotels. Based on these grounds, it seems that tourism puts great pressure on ecosystem and local resources, and it should not be encouraged.However, flourishing tourism in a place can be very rewarding in terms of local economy. Holiday makers flocking to other countries are not only bound to spend on tickets of attractions, but also pay for food, accommodation, transportation and entertainment. Both local people and governments can make a large amount of money through these services, and more employment opportunities can be created as well. I also believe the revenue earned form tourism can be used in turn to reduce pollution and protect the environment.Furthermore, the increasing development of tourism is a boon to travelers as well. The provision of direct airlines makes it possible for them to travel conveniently and comfortably. With adequate local facilities and services available, they can spend more of their holidays having fun and relaxing. In addition, both locals and tourists can experience more cultures than ever before, and they can be more open-minded to eliminate preconceptions and deepen mutual understanding among nations.In conclusion, the prosperity of tourism can provide benefits for people on a global scale. Although there are some inevitable problems, they are outweighed by advantages and can be tackled if proper measures are taken.;"International tourism has evolved into a monumental industry, contributing significantly to the global economy and cultural exchange. However, the rapid growth of this sector has ushered in a myriad of problems that some argue overshadow the benefits it provides. While the advantages of international tourism are undeniable, I contend that the resulting issues necessitate a more balanced approach to its development.On one hand, international tourism offers substantial economic benefits. It generates revenue for host countries, creates jobs, and stimulates local businesses. With millions of travelers crossing borders annually, destinations experience an influx of foreign currency, which can be pivotal in enhancing infrastructure and public services. Furthermore, tourism fosters cultural exchange, allowing people from diverse backgrounds to connect and share experiences, thereby promoting mutual understanding.However, the problems linked to international tourism are increasingly prominent and often detrimental. Environmental degradation looms large, as the carbon footprint from air travel and the strain on natural resources can lead to habitat destruction, pollution, and depletion of local water supplies. Moreover, popular tourist destinations frequently face overcrowding, which not only diminishes the quality of the visitor experience but also disrupts the lives of local residents. These issues can culminate in a phenomenon known as ""overtourism,"" where the very appeal of a location is compromised by excessive visitor numbers.Additionally, international tourism can exacerbate socioeconomic disparities. The benefits of tourism are often unevenly distributed, with large corporations reaping the profits while local communities may not see significant returns. This can lead to increased living costs and cultural commodification, where local traditions are diluted to cater to foreign preferences.In conclusion, while international tourism undeniably brings economic and cultural advantages, the associated challenges cannot be overlooked. A sustainable model for tourism development must prioritize both the interests of local communities and the preservation of natural resources. By addressing these issues, we can enjoy the benefits of international tourism while mitigating its negative impacts."
356;Some children can learn more efficiently by watching TV. Therefore, children should watch TV regularly both in school and at home? do you agree or disagree? ;Education is undeniably pivotal for an individual. Although, it is agreed that learning by watching TV is more effective to some children, I find it difficult not to oppose against the idea of having students spend more time on TVs. The reason for this is traditional education has its stand for most appropriate method. Thus, physical inactivity should not be encouraged for the aim of bettering youngsters' skills.To begin with, classic teaching methods has been scientifically proven and utilized as the best mode of educate a child. Technology and its advance, to some degrees, have influenced the educational industry positively. Nevertheless, it has not changed the importance of teachers' role in classes. The fact that students nowadays do their homework or researches on computers rather than go to libraries is an illustration for this. Yet, monitors are unable to replace the appearance of educators since their knowledge and adaptability is priceless. Therefore, teacher cannot be switched with some unconscious screens. Secondly, watching television is a very passive action and should not be promoted by increasing periods spent on it. On the other hand, children who have had such activities that interrelate to creativity, cooperation, competition tend to perform significantly better in general terms. For instance, a conducted experiment indicates out-performance in skills like differentiate types of plants or animals of a child that experienced various activities in nature to a child spent most of his time watching documentaries. As a result, such activities can equip a child necessary skill that is useful for his future career.In conclusion, despite the fact that learning by watching TV suits some children, kids should never be encourage to engage in such passive activity. School has been applying traditional teaching procedure since for ages. Additionally, it still performs at its best to equip a child with essential skills.;The debate surrounding the role of television in children's learning has gained traction in recent years, with some advocating for its inclusion in educational settings. While I acknowledge that certain educational programs can enhance learning, I fundamentally disagree with the argument that children should watch TV regularly both in school and at home.Firstly, while television can be a powerful educational tool, its effectiveness largely depends on the content and the context in which it is consumed. Programs designed specifically for learning, like documentaries and educational cartoons, can indeed provide valuable information and foster curiosity. However, the amount of time spent in front of a screen can easily lead to passive consumption rather than active engagement with material. Children need to engage in hands-on activities, reading, and interpersonal interactions to develop critical thinking and social skills. Over-reliance on television can inhibit this vital aspect of childhood development.Secondly, regular television viewing can contribute to several negative outcomes. Excessive screen time is linked to a range of health issues, including obesity, sleep disturbances, and decreased physical activity. Moreover, the vast amount of entertainment content available can expose children to inappropriate material, detracting from the educational experience. In an environment where instant gratification is prevalent, children might develop shorter attention spans and a diminished capacity for sustained focus on tasks that require deeper cognitive engagement.Lastly, the family and school environments should prioritize activities that promote active learning and interaction. Reading books, engaging in discussions, and participating in creative projects are far more beneficial to a child's overall development than simply watching TV. In conclusion, while television can play a supportive role in education, it should not become a regular fixture in children's learning experiences at school or home. Instead, a balanced approach emphasizing active learning should be encouraged, fostering healthier habits and more profound educational engagement.
357;In some countries, with the widespread use of the internet, people are able to work or study from home, instead of having to travel to work or college. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages? Discuss and state your own opinion.;Undoubtedly this is an era of internet which impacts one's personal as well as professional life. The effect is seen more on the developed countries where people choose to work or study from home instead of going to office or university. Some consider this approach to be an advantage while others reject this as a disadvantage. Both the points of views will be discussed in order.On the one hand, the benefit that professionals or students get by connecting from home is enormous. For one, it helps working people to maintain work life balance. The best example is the new mother who can join her work as well as take care of her baby. People also get the desired flexibility in terms of working hours. For students too, studying from home is an attractive option. They save the travelling time to Universities and utilize that time on their studies. In a busy city like Tokyo, students waste a lot of time in travelling. Thus, the advantages that people enjoy by working or studying from home, are obvious.On the other hand, one part of the society, has doubt over the productivity of people who prefers to work or study from home. Many employers argue that once an employee works from isolation, he or she spends a lot of time in communication via phone or email with colleagues. This harms an employee's deliverable. Teachers think that students get affected too as they can not clear their doubts in study topics instantly. Due to this they lag in their studies. These factors affect people who work or study from home.Following both the point of views, the option of working or studying from home is thought to provide more benefits than drawbacks. It is hoped that people will continue to use internet to work or study and improve on the disadvantages into the foreseeable future.;The advent of the internet has revolutionized the way we work and study, allowing individuals to engage in these activities from the comforts of home. This shift presents various advantages and disadvantages that merit careful consideration.One of the primary advantages of remote work and study is the flexibility it affords individuals. Without the need to commute, people can create schedules that accommodate personal responsibilities, leading to an improved work-life balance. For students, this flexibility can enhance their ability to engage in various extracurricular activities and personal projects. Moreover, the elimination of commuting time not only saves hours every week but also reduces transportation costs and lowers the carbon footprint, contributing positively to environmental sustainability.Additionally, remote work and study environments often allow for increased productivity, as individuals can tailor their surroundings to suit their personal preferences. For instance, many find that they can concentrate better in a familiar setting devoid of office distractions. This can lead to better outcomes both for students in their academic pursuits and for employees in their professional tasks.On the downside, the lack of social interaction that comes with remote work and study can be a significant drawback. Employees and students may miss out on the camaraderie, collaboration, and networking opportunities that a traditional setting fosters. Furthermore, the boundaries between personal and professional life can blur, leading to difficulties in maintaining motivation and discipline while working from home.In my opinion, while the challenges of remote work and study are notable, the advantages outweigh these disadvantages. The flexibility, cost savings, and potential for increased productivity make it a compelling option. However, it is crucial to address the social isolation aspect by encouraging virtual interactions and developing structured routines that can alleviate the potential downsides. Therefore, with the right strategies in place, the future of remote work and study appears promising.
358;International tourism has become the biggest industry in the world. Some people think it causes tension between people from different culture. Others think it leads to understanding between countries. To what extend do you agree or disagree?Ê;I agree with both opinions that international tourism not only causes tension but also leads to understanding between people from different culture, because most people will be trying to understand each other after they have conflict or debates.There is no doubt that some behaviors of the tourists are not welcome in the local area. Firstly, some people leave the rubbish after visiting the attractions. Therefore, those local residents have to clean the place frequently so that the new batch of tourists will have a tidy and neat environment. Moreover, tourists may offend the local people due to their different culture background. For example, Indians don't eat beef since they worship cows. Thus, if tourists want to respect the tradition, they will not order any beef in the local restaurant. On the other hand, in order to avoid the conflicts between foreigners and locals, people are trying to understand different culture and find solutions. For instance, tourists are given the brochures about the local traditions and customs before they visit the place. Furthermore, the tour guide are willing to help tourists to understand the culture from other countries. Thus, the possibility of the conflicts is reduced because the understanding between both parties.Obviously, people are looking for the solution such as understanding each other while they encounter the conflicts caused by international tourism. Hence, I think international tourism leads to both tension and understanding between people from different culture.;International tourism has evolved into one of the most significant industries globally, driving economic growth and job creation in many countries. However, the impact of this growth on cultural interactions is a topic of considerable debate. On one hand, some argue that tourism exacerbates tensions between different cultures, while others believe it fosters understanding and appreciation among diverse peoples. Those who contend that international tourism can lead to cultural tensions often point to the phenomenon of cultural commodification and appropriation. Tourists may engage in behaviors that are disrespectful to local customs, leading to misunderstandings and resentment. For instance, visitors may unintentionally violate social norms, resulting in friction between locals and tourists. Additionally, the influx of tourists can place strain on local communities, driving up prices and altering traditional ways of life, which can create feelings of alienation among residents.Conversely, proponents of tourism argue that it serves as a powerful tool for promoting cultural exchange and understanding. Through direct interaction with diverse populations, tourists have the opportunity to learn about different ways of life, fostering empathy and reducing stereotypes. When individuals from varied backgrounds share experiences, they can break down barriers and cultivate mutual respect. Furthermore, many countries have utilized tourism as a means to promote their cultural heritage, enhancing global awareness and appreciation of local traditions and values.In conclusion, while international tourism can indeed lead to cultural tensions, it simultaneously holds the potential for bridging gaps between different societies. Ultimately, the impact of tourism on cultural relations largely depends on how both tourists and host communities engage with each other. Promoting responsible tourism practices and encouraging cultural sensitivity can help mitigate tensions and pave the way for greater understanding between nations. Therefore, I believe that with proper management and education, international tourism can be more beneficial than harmful in fostering cross-cultural understanding.
359;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements, and this sets a bad example to young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people think that celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyle rather than the work they do. While I agree this will bring negative impacts on the younger generation, this is not necessarily the case for those celebrities who are ambitious in their jobs.It is true that some celebrities tend to show off their images in front of the public. For example, some movie starts enjoy wearing luxury brand clothes and showing their expensive life style in front of the media, thereby gaining the public attention. If they continue to behave in such a way, it will create a misleading image to young people who may think that extraordinary life can be achieved without hard work. Consequently, the attention of young people may become focused on chasing the dream of celebrity status. This is detrimental to study and work ethics and habits. Nevertheless, I believe that other celebrities do set up role models to young people because of their visible accomplishments. Firstly, celebrities such as sports player whose performance and professional skills can be directly seen by their fans. This means that people understand that the great deal of efforts on training is directly linked to their results. Therefore, this kind of self-made celebrity can inspire children to develop their talents through application and perseverance. Secondly, other celebrities such as musician also have achieved great success in their career. Take Michael Jackson as an example, his works are widely spread around the world, and have been extremely welcomed by the younger generation. His songs spread the idea that people should care about each other, which suggests to young people how to become a good member of society. In summary, although some celebrities misguide young people by showing their external wealth and appearance, other celebrities do lead young people in the right direction.;In contemporary society, the perception of celebrities has undergone a significant transformation. The proliferation of social media and reality television has shifted the focus from talent and hard work to glamour and wealth. Many celebrities are now celebrated more for their extravagant lifestyles rather than their professional achievements, which raises concerns about the implications of this trend for young people.To a large extent, I agree that this phenomenon sets a troubling precedent for the youth. When young individuals observe celebrities flaunting their wealth, endorsing luxurious lifestyles, and receiving acclaim for superficial qualities, it can create an unrealistic standard for success. The message conveyed is that happiness and self-worth are intrinsically tied to material possessions and public admiration. This can lead to disillusionment and a misguided sense of priorities among young people, who may prioritize fame over substance and effort.Moreover, the emphasis on glamour often overshadows the accomplishments of many deserving individuals who toil behind the scenes. Achievements in fields such as science, arts, and social activism are crucial to societal progress, yet they rarely receive the same level of recognition as those tied to fame and fortune. This disparity can inadvertently discourage young people from pursuing careers in less glamorous but highly impactful fields.However, it is worth noting that not all celebrities fit this mold. Many use their platforms to advocate for social change, contribute to charitable causes, and inspire the younger generation through their work. It is essential for young people to distinguish between celebrities who promote positive values and those who perpetuate a culture of superficiality.In conclusion, the current trend of glorifying glamour and wealth over genuine achievements among celebrities can indeed set a negative example for young people. It is vital for both society and the media to celebrate individuals who exemplify hard work and positive contributions, encouraging the youth to aspire to more than just fleeting fame.
360;Children can effectively learn from watching television. Therefore they should be encouraged to watch TV in both home and school. Agree/Disagree?;TV is an immense source of information and pupils can learn and develop various skills by watching it. But I believe that by allowing students to watch TV at both school and house can adversely impact on their overall growth. If children spend too much time in front of TV, it will negatively impact their health and study.It is true that TV is one of the prime source of data and information. There are international and local news channels like BBC, CNBC, Etv Gujarati, Etv Marathi etc to keep individuals updated about latest happenings. By watching TV, children can develop skills in extra-curriculum activities. For example, Cooking programs teach about how to make new dishes and similarly, sports events like cricket, football can teach leadership skills, team building skills, communication skills and many more that can help students in their future jobs.But on other hand, watching TV for a continuously long hours can adversely impact children health. For example, they can get poor eyesight in early ages of childhood, and also develop back pain. Sometimes, students watch restrictive programs not allowed for their ages and this can have major psychological consequences. Many times, students get addictive to their favorite programs like Cartoon channels, or baseball and easily get distracted from study during exam period and this can seriously impact their grades. In conclusion, I believe demerits of watching TV outweigh its merits and thus if students were allowed to freely watch TV without any proper controls by parents or teachers then it would produce more negative effects on children.;"The debate surrounding the role of television in children's learning has garnered extensive attention in recent years. While some argue that watching TV can be detrimental to a child's education and development, I believe that, when used judiciously, television can be a valuable educational tool that should be encouraged in both home and school settings.Firstly, educational television programs are designed to convey knowledge and foster critical thinking skills in an engaging manner. Programs like ""Sesame Street"" or ""Bluey"" blend entertainment with learning, covering important topics such as language, mathematics, social skills, and cultural awareness. These shows often cater to children’s natural curiosity and help to establish connections between concepts through entertaining narratives, which can aid retention and understanding. In this way, television becomes an extension of traditional learning resources, complementing classroom instruction.Moreover, the accessibility of information through television can provide children with a broader worldview. Documentaries and informative series allow them to explore diverse cultures, historical events, and scientific phenomena that they may not encounter in their immediate surroundings. This exposure not only enhances their general knowledge but also instills a sense of empathy and understanding about global issues, preparing them to be more informed future citizens.However, it is crucial to encourage mindful consumption of television. Parents and educators should curate what children watch, emphasizing content that promotes learning and positive values. By setting limits and encouraging discussions about what is viewed, adults can transform passive consumption into an interactive, reflective experience.In conclusion, while concerns about passive viewing and excessive screen time are valid, the potential for educational television to contribute to a child's learning journey is significant. With careful selection and guidance, watching television can be a fruitful activity that enriches children’s learning experiences at home and in school. Therefore, I agree that children's viewing should be encouraged, provided it is done thoughtfully."
361;It has been claimed that workers over 50 are not responsive to rapidly changing ideas in the modern workplace and that for this reason younger workers are to be preferred. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Throughout human history, the offspring has always proved its stronger adaptability and advancement than its predecessor. This is still true in the industrial society nowadays, where younger workers are preferably employed and promoted rather than over-50 workers. There are three reasons that can explain their unresponsiveness to the modern workplace.First and foremost, old workers are not a patch on the younger ones for their unchanged paradigm. The old were raised in poverty, probably caused by war, look at the world from a negative and pessimistic point of view. The misery is so ingrained in their mind that they refuse to change, or more precisely, to accept the existence of such modernity. For example, most would rather choose to piece together parts of a machine than have it done by a robot for their disbelief of its efficiency and safety compared with human's capability.Secondly, their unresponsiveness can be attributed to their attitude towards life. In other words, that they are aware of their deteriorating health and lack of enthusiasm comes with their taste for monotony and safe ideology. This, by all means, is outweigh by youngsters' adventurousness and bravery. Blatantly seen, success of most companies stems from young people, whose enterprising ideas that catch up with the world is regarded as wind of refreshment.Last but not least, knowledge is worth mentioning as a key factor to help young workers outrank the elderly. Who would the employer choose, an old man with old-fashioned education and a young man who is not only good at fundermentaly subject, but also knows how to program or how to speak foreign languages. Not to undermine old workers, but their lack of authority over such basically required fields in this day and age leads to their incompetence in every modern workplace.All in a nutshell, workers over 50 have proven themselves subordinate to the following generation in all aspects. However, in my point of view, it is still of great importance to remain the harmonious coexistence of both sides for the smooth sailing of the company.;"The assertion that workers over 50 are less responsive to rapidly changing ideas in the modern workplace is a sweeping generalization that overlooks the diverse capabilities and experiences of older employees. While it is true that younger workers may often be more familiar with current technologies and trends, suggesting that older workers are inherently less adaptable is not a fair or accurate representation.First, it is essential to acknowledge the wealth of experience that older workers bring to the table. Having navigated various economic shifts, technological advancements, and evolving workplace environments, these individuals often possess a deep understanding of industry nuances that younger workers may lack. Their resilience and adaptability, honed over decades, frequently enable them to embrace change and innovate in response to new challenges. For instance, many older workers have successfully transitioned to remote work and adopted new technologies, demonstrating their ability to adapt effectively.Moreover, the perspective of age diversity in the workplace is immensely valuable. Companies benefit from a blend of ideas and strategies that encompass multiple generations. Older workers can serve as mentors, imparting wisdom and practical knowledge that enrich the overall workforce. By creating an inclusive environment where age diversity is celebrated, organizations can foster creativity and problem-solving capabilities that leverage the strengths of all employees, regardless of age.It is also critical to recognize the potential age biases that permeate the workplace. Disregarding older workers solely due to their age may lead to a loss of valuable skills and insights. Hiring decisions based on age rather than competence can hinder a company's innovation and growth.In conclusion, rather than favoring younger workers purely for their perceived agility, it is vital to appreciate the strengths that older employees bring to modern workplaces. The capacity for adaptability is not age-specific; thus, fostering a culture that values the contributions of all employees—regardless of age—will ultimately lead to more dynamic and successful organizations."
362;The use of machines are increasing day by day which is reducing physical work done by humans. Do you think advantages outweigh the disadvantages ;Advancements in technology have touched new heights in past few decades. This can be seen no where clearer than in increasing use of machines now a days. These machines reduce the physical work done by humans. Some people think that this is a positive development while others believe it to be disadvantageous for humans.Both sides will be critiqued before a reasoned conclusion is reached.It is felt by many that the usage of machines is harmful for health of humans since machines decrease the work done by people. For example, in many institutions staircases are replaced by lifts now a days. People opt for elevators instead of climbing one or two flight of stairs. It is confirmed in a number of researches that daily usage of elevators in workplaces promotes obesity. So this example clearly shows the linkage between using machines and adverse health effects.On other side of the coin, many people believe that usage of machines makes work easier and less time is consumed for doing similar amount of work. Take the example of use of food processors in kitchens. The work of chopping, blending, grating, kneading has become so easy that people can not imagine their lives without this simple machine at their homes. Thus it is very obvious that using machines makes daily tasks less time consuming and less cumbersome.After analyzing these two points of view, it is believed that using machines is advantageous as machines make work easy and smooth. The negative effects on health can be put on the back seat because there are many other ways to exercise and stay healthy. Therefore, it is hoped that in coming time people will enjoy using more and more machines and will choose alternative ways to stay disease free.;The rapid advancement and integration of machines into daily life have become a defining feature of the modern era. From factories to households, automation and robotics are increasingly taking over tasks that were once the sole domain of human labor. While there are undeniable advantages to this trend—such as increased efficiency and productivity—there are also significant disadvantages that warrant consideration. Ultimately, the question of whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages depends on various contextual factors.On one hand, the benefits of machines and automation are substantial. They have revolutionized industries by streamlining production processes, resulting in faster, more precise, and often cheaper output. This efficiency not only meets the growing consumer demand but also allows companies to reallocate human resources towards more complex tasks that require creativity and critical thinking. Moreover, machines can perform hazardous jobs, thus reducing workplace injuries and ensuring safety for human workers.Conversely, the increasing reliance on machines poses serious challenges. One of the most pressing concerns is job displacement. As machines continue to evolve and become capable of performing tasks that once required human skill, a significant portion of the workforce may find itself redundant. This displacement can lead to economic instability and increased unemployment rates, particularly for low-skilled workers who have limited opportunities for retraining or upskilling. Furthermore, the over-reliance on machines may result in a loss of valuable human skills and craftsmanship, leading to a societal disconnect from manual labor.In conclusion, while the advantages of machines—such as enhanced efficiency, safety, and productivity—are compelling, the disadvantages, particularly in terms of job displacement and the erosion of human skills, must not be overlooked. To navigate this technological shift responsibly, it is crucial for society to find a balance that embraces innovation while also safeguarding employment and fostering human skill development. Therefore, whether the advantages truly outweigh the disadvantages remains a nuanced issue that merits careful consideration.
363;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extend do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;These days, most of countries on the world invest for technology. It is evident that technology promotes economy. Many people think that conventional things will not exist and should be eliminated. I totally disagree this opinion.First of all, traditional skills and ways belong to value of culture. They make differences between countries. Every country has unique tradtions which show their creation, intelligence. Consequently, people feel pround of their country, so they keep reserving conventions. For example, ways to build a house in every country are different and they distinguish between countries.In addition, in some cases that traditional way can not replace by a new technology. Lot of people like to use traditional things because if their quality and durability. In paticular, vases are made by hand would be used more. Futhermore, there are plenty of works that using traditional way is unique method. For instance, making cone hats from leaves have to use hand. Not only because there is no machine for the work, but also it looks more beautiful when it is made by hand, so resulting in greater value economy.The last thing is about education. Traditional skills and ways of life will help youngsters study and know more history. Methods which their ancestors used in the past will be displayed again for new generations. After that, they might create somethings that are useful for life.In conclusion, technology has brought many benefits, but traditional skills and ways are always valuable and will last forever.;"The relationship between technological advancement and traditional skills is a complex and contentious issue. On one hand, the rise of modern technology has indeed led to the decline of certain traditional practices; on the other hand, the preservation of these skills often offers cultural value and identity that technology alone cannot provide. While I acknowledge that technology brings undeniable benefits, I contend that it is not genuinely pointless to strive to preserve traditional skills and ways of life.First, technological development can lead to the obsolescence of traditional skills, as machinery and automation often outperform human capabilities. For example, the rise of industrialized farming has diminished the demand for traditional agricultural techniques, resulting in a disconnection from local food sources and an loss of knowledge about sustainable practices. This trend can lead to homogenization of culture, where unique local customs are replaced by standardized practices driven by mass production.However, the argument that it is pointless to keep traditional skills alive fails to recognize the intrinsic value these practices hold. Traditional skills often embody a community's history, values, and identity. They foster a connection to the land and create a sense of belonging. Furthermore, in recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in artisanal goods, organic farming, and sustainable living. This suggests that traditional practices can coexist with modernization and that there is indeed a market for them.In conclusion, while technological advancement can render some traditional skills obsolete, the effort to preserve these skills is not futile. Balancing technological innovation with the preservation of cultural heritage enriches society, fosters diversity, and strengthens community ties. Rather than viewing traditional skills as relics of the past, we should see them as essential elements of our social fabric that deserve to be maintained alongside modern developments."
364;The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Big cities nowadays can be described as melting pots. The problem off traffic overload, caused by overpopulation, has aroused interest of many city planners. It is argued that only if the demand to go out on the street is cut down can we solve the seemingly insurmountable issue of traffic gridlock. However, I have to profoundly disagree for there are still two viable solutions besides besides this way.First of all, public transport is a key factor to minimize the number of vehicles on the street. Buses and trains have been phased in the streets for quite a long time and have proven themselves the best candidates among all options. Apparently, a bus can carry no less than 30 people, while a train can carry as much as nine or even ten times of that number. Not to mention the fact that highway train is operated underground, which leaves the street above with buses and non-fuel-based vehicles. Together, they will lessen the crowded image in most cities nowadays.Second, rarely do we realize the helpful existence of urban areas. It is believed that if some of the enormous shopping malls or universities were relocated in the commuter belt, the city street would be les burstling and overly-teemed as it is now. As a rule of thumb, huge centers of attention distributed equally in a wide region means that residential areas will come along thus exert less pressure on the public facilities. The city itself will be absolved of enduring the influx of immigrants as well as unemployed people.In conclusion, city planner can still opt for non-personal vehicle and the exploitation of the suburb areas. It is highly recommended to put forward such solution, especially in some developing countries like Vietnam or China, with the ever-growing demand for job or education.;The statement that the only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities is by minimizing the need for travel for work, education, or shopping puts forth a critical perspective on urban congestion. While I agree that reducing travel demand can mitigate traffic, I believe it is not the sole solution. A multifaceted approach is necessary to effectively tackle the issue.Firstly, the rise of remote work is a significant step towards diminishing traffic congestion. The COVID-19 pandemic has led many businesses to adopt flexible work arrangements, reducing the number of commuters during peak hours. By promoting telecommuting, cities can lessen the strain on their transportation infrastructure, as fewer people on the roads equate to decreased traffic congestion.Additionally, online education and e-commerce have transformed traditional frameworks, allowing individuals to access learning opportunities and shop without the need to travel. Schools and universities offering hybrid or fully online courses can significantly decrease the volume of daily commutes. Similarly, encouraging local shopping through enhanced e-commerce options can ease congestion by reducing the need for residents to travel long distances for goods.However, while reducing travel needs may help, it is insufficient on its own. Cities must also improve public transportation systems, making them more efficient, reliable, and user-friendly. Investing in alternative modes of transport, such as cycling and walking infrastructure, can promote more sustainable commuting options. Urban planning that incorporates mixed-use developments can also encourage local living, thus minimizing the distance people need to travel for work or leisure.In conclusion, while I agree that reducing the need for travel is a crucial strategy in combating urban traffic congestion, it should be complemented by enhancements in public transportation, urban design, and alternative commuting solutions. A holistic approach is essential for creating sustainable and livable cities.
365;Celebrities are usually famous for glamour and wealth rather than their achievements. Some say taking them as an example can be dangerous for young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Young people all over the world are greatly influenced by media and celebrities. These celebrities are popular among younger generations because of their glamorous lifestyles. It is agreed that following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth. This will be proven by looking at how health and personality of young people is affected by following celebrities as their mentors. First of all, it is seen that following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents. Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age. For example, in a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes. This example makes it clear that imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals.Secondly, it is believed that when youth follows celebrities it affects personality of young people in a bad way. Adolescents follow not only the make up and attire of their favorite stars but also their behavior. For instance recently in a poll conducted by an American magazine it was found that most of the parents and teachers complain that teenagers use derogatory words and abusive language at home and at schools. So, this example makes it obvious that these glamorous celebrities have a poor effect on the conduct of young people.Thus to conclude, it can be said that when young people follow celebrities, it affects their health as well as behavior in a negative way. This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual. Therefore it is recommended that young people should be educated not to follow these celebrities blindly, rather they should focus on their career so that they may hope for a bright future.;The phenomenon of celebrity culture has increasingly influenced society, particularly among the youth. While some celebrities are revered for their talent and hard work, a significant number are celebrated primarily for their glamorous lifestyles and immense wealth. This raises concerns about the role models that young people choose, prompting the question: is it dangerous for the youth to idolize such figures?On one hand, it can be argued that celebrities often embody success and aspirational lifestyles, which can motivate young people to pursue their dreams. For instance, entrepreneurs like Rihanna and Jay-Z, who have transformed their artistic careers into substantial business empires, provide examples of how passion and perseverance can lead to success. Their stories emphasize that wealth does not come without hard work, and they can serve as inspiration for young individuals to strive for their own goals.However, the portrayal of celebrity life often glamorizes superficial values, such as materialism and social status, potentially sending detrimental messages. Many prominent figures are celebrated not for their contributions to society or their skills, but rather for scandals, extravagant lifestyles, and public personas. This emphasis on appearance and wealth can lead young people to prioritize fame over personal achievement, diminishing the value of hard work and dedication. Moreover, the relentless scrutiny and pressure to maintain a certain status can have negative implications on mental health, suggesting that the path to celebrity is fraught with challenges that are not often depicted in the media.In conclusion, while some celebrities can inspire and motivate, the predominant focus on glamour and wealth can lead to unhealthy aspirations among youth. It is essential for young people to recognize the difference between genuine achievements and superficial fame, seeking role models who exemplify integrity, resilience, and true accomplishment. Balancing admiration for public figures with an understanding of their complexities may help mitigate the risks associated with idolization of celebrity culture.
366;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The gender issues have been already discussing for many years in order to give solutions for realising the equal proportion of developing human resources. Implementing the statue and right of equal education are believed as a sustainable policy that should be held. Nowadays, there are many institutions that accept the same average number of male and female students in many kinds of course. I strongly agree about this statement.The proportion of women is rising year by year in many parts of the world recently. Automatically, the issue stimulates the stakeholders from many places to think what kind of preparations they should take for stabilising the economic growth and the quality life of people. We can see now that women tend to work in various fields which in the past normally done by men such as being engineers, and dealing with machines. Those activities have proven that women can also do the men's works. Therefore, female students are indicated having the same potential and capability as men.Another reason is order to gaining higher education degree as it is required to establish a person's career. These days, it is so hard for young people to get a proper job when they have not degree certificate from Universities. So, learning from human's history, education provides someone to widen his or her knowledge and experience for facing the real situation of workplace through subject taught in college. According to this opinion, giving equal education for both men and women is a must.In conclusion, the needs for having developed-skills and gaining degree certificate in order to build someone's career are totally needed to implement and applied for any gender. As the world's situation is always changing, act for distributing education needs are absolutely important to compete the future challenges.;The topic of gender equality in higher education, particularly in terms of university admissions, has garnered considerable attention in recent years. The proposition that universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject raises significant questions about equity, meritocracy, and the nature of academic disciplines.On one hand, one could argue that equal representation is essential in eliminating systemic biases and stereotypes that may discourage certain genders from pursuing specific fields. Historically, many academic disciplines have been male-dominated—particularly in STEM areas such as engineering and physics—while others, like humanities and social sciences, tend to attract more female students. By enforcing equal gender representation across all disciplines, universities could create a more balanced educational environment that fosters diversity in thought and perspective. Increased diversity has been shown to enhance creativity, problem-solving, and overall academic performance.However, the enforcement of strict gender quotas raises concerns regarding merit and individual choice. Education should prioritize the capabilities and aspirations of students rather than adhere to rigid demographic criteria. Imposing equal admissions could inadvertently lead to unqualified candidates being accepted over more qualified applicants simply based on gender, ultimately undermining academic standards. Furthermore, individuals should have the freedom to choose their fields of study based on personal interest and aptitude rather than societal expectations of gender parity.In conclusion, while the promotion of gender balance in higher education is crucial and should be encouraged, it is essential to pursue this goal through supportive measures rather than rigid quotas. Initiatives such as outreach programs to inspire underrepresented genders in specific subjects, mentorship opportunities, and scholarships can promote equality without compromising the integrity of academic institutions. The ultimate aim should be to create a university environment that welcomes and supports all students, allowing them to thrive based on their unique skills and interests.
367;It has been proved that smoking kills. In some countries it has been made illegal for people to smoke in all public places except in certain areas. All countries should make these rules. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;People the world over have designated smoothing as a shameful practice and a lethal habit. Several millions of smokers die suffering from cancers such as lung and oral. This bad habit also responsible for causing health hazards to passive-smokers: who are around smoking is taken place. Thus, it is argued that smoking should be made prohibited in public places such as bus and railway stations. This position will be proven by looking at how this arrangement has benefited both general public as well as smokers.To start, non-smoking public would be undoubtedly benefited by enforcing such restrain. Prior to 1980's public places in Sri Lanka, illustrates unpleasant situation where people smoked freely. Even in public transportation they engaged in this intolerant bad habit, some instances that lead to belligerent incidents. After enforcing restrictions the situation came to control and this act as benefit rendered to the public.In addition to this, introducing smoking ban in public places would greatly discourage people from engaging tobacco puffing. For instance, further enforcement banned smoking in capital in Sri Lanka has reduced this consumption related diseases and deaths, as per the ministry of health. As this shows, smoking restrictions has successfully daunted public from this bad puffing that put less strain on country's healthcare systems.After analyzing smoke illegalization in public places in Sri Lanka, it has been proven benefits people enjoy this arrangement. It is thus hoped governments would consider smoke banning in public places following footsteps of Sri Lanka as well as many other countries.;"The detrimental health effects of smoking are widely recognized, with evidence indicating that it is a leading cause of preventable deaths worldwide. As such, the argument for imposing strict regulations on smoking in public places has gained significant traction. I firmly believe that all countries should adopt stricter rules regarding smoking in public spaces, for several key reasons.Firstly, the protection of public health is paramount. Smoking not only harms the smoker but also poses serious risks to those around them through secondhand smoke. The World Health Organization has reported that secondhand smoke contains over 7,000 harmful chemicals, with no safe level of exposure. By enforcing bans on smoking in public places, governments can significantly reduce these risks, protecting children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions from the dangers of involuntary smoke exposure.Secondly, such regulations serve to promote a healthier society. By creating smoke-free environments in public areas, we encourage people to consider quitting smoking or to never start in the first place. This has a ripple effect; as smoking becomes less visible in daily life, social norms shift, leading to a lower prevalence of smoking over time. Evidence from countries with strict smoking bans, such as Ireland and Australia, demonstrates a clear decline in smoking rates following the implementation of comprehensive smoking legislation.Finally, implementing smoking bans in public places can also reduce the financial burden on healthcare systems. Smoking-related illnesses contribute significantly to healthcare costs, and by fostering a smoke-free population, governments can alleviate some of these expenses, reallocating resources to more critical areas of public health.In conclusion, given the overwhelming evidence regarding the harmful effects of smoking and its broader implications for society, I strongly advocate for all countries to implement restrictions on smoking in public areas. This would pave the way for healthier communities and contribute to a decline in smoking-related illnesses and deaths."
368;Tourism is a modern form of colonialism. It distorts local economies, causes environmental damage and ruins the places it exploits. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;Tourism, since its first appearance a long time ago, can be described as a controversial celebrity. Some believe that tourism is attributed to domestic economic distortion, environmental devastation and irrepairable damage to the exploited places. However, I strongly disagree with this misconcept for the two following reasons.First of all, tourism plays an indispensable role in nurturing the economy in a way it is meant to be. Basically, places of interest often locate in the wilderness areas, of which economy, before their appearance, haven't blossmed yet. Not until the investment of some companies do chains of hotels and services spring up. It will, by all means, attract considerable attention which goes hand in hand with the enormous income for the local residents. In other word, tourism helps divert the local economy to its right direction, which exploit the best out of its own potential.Secondly, even though environmental damage is inevitable, it is not tourism to be blamed for. In order to turn a wilderness into a place of attraction, the planners must have taken the nourishment of the sceneries into thorough consideration. To be precise, for instance, a fortune is spent on trimming the trees, watering the flowers, preserving and balancing the local fauna and flora, in the hope of beautifying the wild. Not to mention ecotourism, a new kind of environment-friendly service, which gives all environmentalists and nature lovers a hand in raising the awareness of people in protecting their coexistent creatures. Because of that, tourism should not be alledged to be notorous for its detriment to the ecological diversity.All thing considered, tourism has proven its friendly attitude towards the exploited areas in terms of finance and environmental impact. In my opinion, the combination of tourism and teaching process is highly recommended in pursuit of a harmonial relationship between human and their surroundings.;Tourism, often hailed as a vital economic driver in many regions, has drawn criticism for its role in perpetuating economic disparities, environmental degradation, and the erosion of local cultures. The assertion that tourism acts as a modern form of colonialism stems from the observation that it can exploit resources and communities in a way that mirrors colonial practices, albeit in a contemporary context.To support this idea, proponents argue that tourism distorts local economies by prioritizing foreign investment over the interests of local communities. In many popular destinations, profits from tourism largely flow to multinational corporations, leaving local residents in precarious economic situations. The focus on serving tourists can lead to inflated prices for basic goods and services, effectively pricing out locals and subsuming their traditional livelihoods. This economic displacement resonates with the colonial legacy, where indigenous economies were often undermined to benefit outsiders.Moreover, the environmental footprint of mass tourism is undeniable. The influx of visitors can lead to habitat destruction, pollution, and an overexploitation of natural resources. Many tourist hotspots struggle with waste management and infrastructural strain, resulting in significant environmental costs. This aspect mirrors colonial exploitation, whereby natural resources are extracted without regard for sustainability or the well-being of the local population.However, it is important to recognize that tourism can also bring about positive change when managed responsibly. Sustainable tourism initiatives aim to empower local communities, preserve cultural heritage, and protect the environment. When local stakeholders have a significant role in decision-making, tourism can foster economic growth while respecting local traditions.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns regarding the destructive elements of tourism akin to colonial practices, it is crucial to consider the potential for sustainable models that support rather than exploit local communities. Balancing economic benefits with environmental and cultural preservation is key to transforming tourism from a potential colonial force into a platform for mutual growth and respect.
369;In the last 20 years there have been significant development in the field of information technology (IT), for example the World Wide Web and communication by e-mail. However, future developments in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive. To what extent do you agree with this view?;The appearance of information technology (IT) in the last 20 years has brought about significant developments in life standard as well as work efficiency. However, it is believed that the evolution also proves to be detrimental. In my opinion, there is a likelihood that future developments in IT will put the users at their own expense.With the rapid developing pace, IT seems to have turned its users to its slaves. In the past, there used to be World Wide Web or e-mail, but the cyber world now varies form games, online TV shows to means of communication, and probably still keeps going. Such irrisistible temptations drift people from the real world to the unreal ones, resulting in their dependence on technical equipment. What is more, the lack of soft skills attained form outdoor activities will agitate the IT addict, therefore, staying inside with computer and mobile phone will always be the first alternative.Future IT has also aroused concern on health issues. The existence of Skype, Viber or Yahoo has notably reduced even the longest distance into one click. As a result, rarely do people go out of their comfot zone, provided with snack and air conditioner, to assemble with others in flesh. Needless to say, their action will make a beeline for obesity, short-sighted, diabetes and other heart-related problems.In conclusion, despite the contribution of IT to the society, its effect on the users' independence and prositution should not be out of concern. To my mind, there have to be some alterations before IT has more serious impact on each individual's life.;In the last two decades, the advancements in information technology (IT) have transformed every aspect of our lives, from how we communicate to how we conduct business. Innovations such as the World Wide Web and email have enhanced connectivity and accessibility to information, fostering a more interconnected world. However, there is an ongoing debate about whether future developments in IT will yield more negative outcomes than positive ones.On one hand, it is undeniable that IT has brought about remarkable benefits. The ability to communicate instantly with anyone across the globe has revolutionized personal relationships and created new opportunities for collaboration and learning. Moreover, the advent of e-commerce has shown how IT can empower entrepreneurs and create job opportunities, allowing for economic growth and innovation.Nevertheless, as we look towards the future, several concerns suggest that subsequent developments in IT may result in detrimental effects. One significant issue is the erosion of privacy. As technology advances, the amount of personal data collected increases, leading to potential abuses by corporations and governments alike. High-profile data breaches and surveillance scandals have raised alarms about the implications for individual freedom and consent.Additionally, the rise of artificial intelligence and automation could exacerbate economic inequality. While these technologies promise efficiency and convenience, they also threaten jobs, particularly in low-skilled sectors. The displacement of workers could lead to widespread unemployment and social unrest, creating divides within society.Furthermore, the pervasive influence of social media has been linked to mental health issues and misinformation. As technology becomes more integral to our lives, the potential for cyberbullying, addiction, and the manipulation of information could deepen societal divides and compromise democratic processes.In conclusion, while the advancements in IT over the past two decades have been largely positive, the trajectory of future developments poses substantial risks. Balancing innovation with ethical considerations will be crucial to ensuring that technology serves humanity rather than undermines it. Thus, I moderately agree with the view that future advancements in IT are likely to have more negative effects than positive—particularly if we do not address the looming challenges thoughtfully.
370;An increasing number of people are turning to vegetarianism. some belive that people are following a vegetarian diet for reasons other than animal rights issues. Do you agree with this? Give reasons why some people are choosing to become vegetarian;Since the dawn of time, human has considered meat as a fundamental protein sources. Meat has served as the main dish in almost every family's meals all around the world. Recent years, however, has seen a rapid increase in the number of vegetarians. Some people claim that this is brought about by the care for animal rights issue, others think it is much beyond that. It is clear to me that people avoid eating meat mostly for the sake of their health and relegious aspect.Firstly, health improvement is the main reason for vegetarian diet to become so popular. Many researchers have convinced that many kinds of vegetable contain antioxydant which can prevent cancer. This fortifies the fact that a vegetable diet can do good for our health. Although some argue that a meal without meat can lead to a lack of protein intake, it is proved that many kinds of bean such as soy bean or pea are also comparable protein sources.Secondy, relegious beliefs also contributes to a vegetarian diet. Some religion, such as Buddha, believes that animals were human being in their previous life, so eating their meat mean you eat the flesh of your parent sentient beings. It is often said that this view is rather unscientific. However, I am convinced that it is vital to follow one's own religious practices which can bring the enlightenment in mind.To sum up, it is evident for me that people choose to become vegetarians for health and religious concern rather than the benefits of animals. However, a meal which is nutritionally balanced is always most recommended.;The rising trend of vegetarianism in contemporary society reflects a shift in dietary preferences that goes beyond the traditional argument centered around animal rights. While ethical considerations regarding the treatment of animals undoubtedly play a critical role in many individuals' decision to adopt a vegetarian lifestyle, numerous other factors contribute to this growing phenomenon.One significant reason for the increasing embrace of vegetarianism is health consciousness. Many people are becoming more aware of the adverse health effects associated with high meat consumption, such as heart disease, obesity, and certain types of cancer. Research suggests that a well-balanced vegetarian diet can lead to improved health outcomes, such as lower cholesterol levels and enhanced heart health, prompting individuals to make dietary changes in pursuit of a healthier lifestyle.Environmental concerns also play a pivotal role in the decision to choose vegetarianism. The meat industry is a leading contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and water depletion. As climate change becomes an increasingly pressing issue, many individuals are motivated to reduce their carbon footprint by opting for plant-based diets. According to various studies, the production of plant-based foods typically requires fewer resources than meat production, making vegetarian diets a more sustainable choice for those concerned about the planet's future.Moreover, cultural and socioeconomic factors are influencing this trend. With the proliferation of vegetarian and plant-based products in the market, dietary changes are becoming more accessible and convenient. Restaurants and grocery stores now offer a wide variety of meat-free options, fostering an environment where vegetarianism can flourish. Additionally, globalization has introduced diverse culinary practices and plant-based cuisines, inspiring individuals to explore vegetarian diets anew.In conclusion, while ethical considerations regarding animal rights remain significant, health benefits, environmental sustainability, and cultural influences are equally compelling reasons for the growing number of individuals embracing vegetarianism. This multifaceted trend highlights a broader shift towards conscious living and ethical consumerism in our society.
371;When a country develops its technology, the traditional skills and ways of life die out. It is pointless to try and keep them alive. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;There is no doubt the application of technological developments in some countries will be accompanied with modern skills and new lifestyles. It is argued that these so-called cultural invasions will result in the distinction of national traditions, and there is no need to maintain them. However, from my point of view, what can be expected, is a change of the role of the tradition but not its disappearance from the society.It is undeniable that the country's culture is passed down mainly through traditional skills and ways of life. For instance, in Vietnam, many water puppet shows which once demonstrated our seasonal agriculture and communal activities, are today substituted by cinemas and music concerts. This means the young generation can solely get access to their ancestor's early life through books and images, which otherwise would be much more easily absorbed.In tradition, a person should look back at the past, mainly by means of custom handcraft or antique lifestyle, to progress. Understanding why, and how our predecessors survived through thick and thin will probably be invaluable lessons for us today. Also, study form their mistakes helps us accomplish our goal with smooth sailing.To sumarize, there should never be any replacement for traditional skills or ways of life. They are the ones that teach, and will teach us to be self-esteem and experienced, which means their preservation throughout history deserve our attention.;The relationship between technological development and the preservation of traditional skills and ways of life has been a topic of extensive debate. While it is undeniable that modernization often leads to the waning of certain traditions, I argue that it is not entirely pointless to strive for their preservation.Firstly, technological advancements can enhance the quality of life and drive economic growth. As societies embrace innovation, they often shed outdated practices that are no longer feasible or efficient. For instance, the rise of automation in agriculture has increased productivity, reducing the reliance on labor-intensive traditional farming techniques. However, this does not mean that traditional methods should be entirely abandoned. Many of these practices carry cultural significance and embody sustainable approaches that modern methods may overlook. Furthermore, the loss of traditional skills can lead to a homogenization of culture. When countries globally adopt similar technologies and lifestyles, they risk losing the unique identities that have been shaped over generations. Preserving traditional skills can foster a sense of belonging and pride within communities. For example, crafts such as pottery, weaving, and traditional cooking not only contribute to cultural heritage but also attract tourism and promote local economies. In contrast, some argue that the preservation of traditional practices can hinder progress and innovation. However, it is essential to recognize that modernization and tradition can coexist. Many communities have successfully integrated modern technology with traditional practices, allowing them to thrive while retaining their cultural roots. In conclusion, while technological development is crucial for advancement, the outright dismissal of traditional skills and ways of life is a shortsighted approach. Striving to preserve these elements can enrich society, provide economic opportunities, and foster a sense of identity in an ever-evolving world. Rather than viewing them as incompatible, we should seek a harmonious balance between the old and the new.
372;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"""Capital punishment or the death penalty is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime."" In recently years, many countries have polished the law of the death penalty. In the whole world, 51% countries have polished death penalty; even, it is at 98% in Europe. Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase. However, others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty. Personally, I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons.Firstly, capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture. Crimes kill someone which is illegal; nevertheless, the government use law to punish them, which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one. As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time; also, it is regarded as the ""legalized revenge"" to victims' family. Hence, death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture.Secondly, nobody has the right to take another human life. It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being. No one has the right to take the life of a human; even if he committed murder. If you kill a criminal, you become a criminal. Moreover, if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem, it is neither unethical nor immoral. In short, crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment.Finally, with some of serious criminals, capital punishment is an easy way out. Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds. If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins, it is so easy for them. They do not undergo any pain or misery. Why do not we have other wisely punishments? As we can see some industries such as mining, oil and gas extraction, reclamation, etc, needs many labors. Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country- it is better. Moreover, rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts. To conclude, capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge, it is an easy way for serious crimes, and nobody has rights to take others life; thus, it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society. The world should consider clearly about polishing the law of the dead penalty.";The debate over capital punishment has long been a contentious issue, often centered around its perceived effectiveness in deterring crime. Proponents of the death penalty argue that its existence is crucial for maintaining social order and reducing violent crime rates. However, a closer examination reveals a more nuanced picture of the relationship between capital punishment and crime control.On one hand, supporters of the death penalty assert that the ultimate sanction serves as a powerful deterrent to potential offenders. They argue that the fear of execution may discourage individuals from committing heinous acts, particularly violent crimes such as murder. The logic is straightforward: if the consequences are severe and final, individuals may think twice before engaging in behaviour that could lead to their own execution. However, numerous studies have shown that the correlation between capital punishment and reduced crime rates is far from definitive. In fact, many countries that have abolished the death penalty have not experienced a significant uptick in violent crime. For instance, nations such as Canada and many European countries have seen stable or declining crime rates despite the absence of capital punishment. This indicates that other factors, such as socio-economic conditions, educational opportunities, and effective law enforcement, play a more significant role in ensuring public safety.Moreover, capital punishment raises ethical concerns about the possibility of wrongful convictions and the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities. The irreversible nature of the death penalty poses a considerable risk of executing innocent individuals, undermining the very justice it aims to uphold.In conclusion, while the intention behind capital punishment is to enhance security and deter crime, evidence suggests that its effectiveness is questionable and fraught with moral implications. Alternative approaches focusing on rehabilitation, prevention, and community support may be more effective in addressing the root causes of violence and creating a safer society. Thus, I argue that capital punishment is not essential for controlling violence and that a reevaluation of our justice system could yield more humane and effective outcomes.
373;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A zoo has no useful purpose. Use specific reasons and examples to explain your answer.;For a long time, the zoo has been a second home to endangered animals. However, other people believe that the existence of zoos is next to nothing. In my opinion, the zoo deserves maintenance and public respect for two specific reasons.First of all, the zoo should be considered as a means of education with regard to providing real and vivid materials for learners. With zoos, pupils will have a chance of observing the habit and unique instinct of, for instance, a lion or a crocodile. At a higher level, it is of university students' benefits to do biological research based on practical statistics and live recordings, which otherwise would not be at hand. This means that the zoos conduce to the acquisition of knowledge at various levels.Secondly, the zoo also serve as a means of ecological protection. Nowadays the process of globalisation is accompanied by the encroachment upon natural habitats, which consequently calls for the help of zoos. What is more, the ever-increasing huntings are having a heavy toll on rare and specious species. Only when zoos appear are such distinction-driven animals as: giraffe, panda, koala or leopard provided with their own inaccessible territory.In sum, the role of zoos towards both human and animals is undeniably indispensable. It is highly recommended that zoos should be seen with different perspective in order to function at their most efficiency.;The statement that a zoo has no useful purpose is one that can be interpreted in various ways depending on personal perspectives and values. I disagree with this assertion, as I believe that zoos serve several meaningful purposes that contribute both to education and conservation.Firstly, zoos play a crucial role in educating the public about animals and their habitats. Many individuals do not have the opportunity to encounter wildlife in their natural environments. Zoos provide a unique platform for people, especially children, to learn about different species, their behaviors, and the ecosystems they inhabit. Through carefully designed exhibits and informative programs, zoos foster a connection between the public and wildlife, raising awareness about environmental issues and promoting conservation efforts. For instance, many zoos conduct outreach programs that educate students on the importance of biodiversity and the threats faced by endangered species.Secondly, zoos are actively involved in conservation efforts. Many animals are endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and climate change. Zoos participate in breeding programs aimed at increasing the population of threatened species. Organizations such as the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) coordinate these efforts, striving to reintroduce species back into their natural habitats. For instance, the California condor, once on the brink of extinction, has seen a resurgence thanks to breeding programs initiated by zoos.In conclusion, while there are valid criticisms of certain zoos that prioritize entertainment over education and conservation, the overall purpose of well-managed zoos remains significant. They serve as important centers for learning and conservation, helping to bridge the gap between humanity and the natural world. As such, I firmly believe that zoos do have a useful purpose in today’s society.
374;Several languages are in danger of extinction because they are spoken by very small numbers of people. Some people say that governments should spend public money on saving these languages, while others believe that would be a waste of money. Discuss both these views and give your opinion?;"It is true that the increasing number of languages which are at risk of extinction has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. The question whether our government should make an effort to preserve them by investing more money on that minority languages or not is still a debatable one. I personally suppose that no matter how widely they are spoken, every language should be protected from being disappeared.There are several reasons why saving regional languages could be seen as a waste of money. Firstly, we need to consider that if the government expands the use scope of that languages, it can be really expensive because educational programmes will need to be given so as to keep young people learning and using them. For example, some certain areas in the Southern Vietnam have been trying to help their secondary school students who are originally from khmer people speak their language beside Vietnamese, so the local government has recently struggled with their costly investments on language teachers, facilities and appropriate materials. Secondly, it is obvious that in many aspects such as communication, trade, cooperation as well as transaction, it will be absolutely easier for the whole society to work together in one language only.Despite of the above arguments, i still strongly believe that the government should try to preserve minority languages. This is because language can be seen as much more than just one method of communication. In addition, forming a language must be undergone thousands of years; thus, it deserves to be respected and preserved. Last but not least, language is one of the essential factors creating the differences and unique cutures in the world. Therefore, saving the use of that kinds of languages in this case generally is the most important element of the cultural diversity's preservation.In conclusion, although letting languages spoken by ethnic minorities be extinct seems to be very beneficial, it will definitely impact seriously on many other aspects especially in the loss of our cultural heritages.";"The question of whether governments should allocate public funds to preserve endangered languages is a contentious one. On one hand, advocates for language preservation argue that every language contains unique cultural values, historical context, and knowledge that are essential to the diversity of human civilization. They contend that when a language disappears, it takes with it an entire worldview, erasing cultural identities and histories. For instance, Indigenous languages often carry specific ecological knowledge and traditional practices that are invaluable to communities and society as a whole. Supporting these languages through funding could foster cultural revitalization and strengthen community bonds, promoting broader societal respect for diversity.Conversely, critics argue that investments in preserving small language groups may be impractical. They suggest that public resources are limited and should be directed towards initiatives with more immediate impacts on society, such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure. From this perspective, it may seem illogical to allocate funds to languages spoken by only a handful of individuals when pressing social issues require attention. Critics also argue that languages naturally evolve over time, and as societies change, some languages will inevitably fade away, making the preservation efforts futile.In my opinion, while the concerns about resource allocation are valid, the significance of cultural preservation cannot be underestimated. Investing in endangered languages is not merely about saving a mode of communication; it is an investment in cultural heritage and diversity. Funds can be prioritized in a way that balances both language preservation and essential services. By promoting linguistic diversity, we enrich our global community and foster mutual respect among different cultures. Therefore, governments should indeed consider funding efforts to save endangered languages as part of a broader commitment to cultural sustainability."
375;Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagreee with this statement?;"There has always been a saying in medicine: ""Prevention is better than cure"". This statement has raised a question whether the government should allocate a large sum out of the national health budget to educating and phasing in health-protected measures. In my opinion, this plan should be put into practice for the two reasons mentioned accordingly.No one can argue the importance to include health lessons in school programmes, especially at primary level, in the hope of raising people's awareness. Children should be taught about balanced diets, nutritious food as well as harmful ones, thereby they will have a fundamental grasp of how to lead a healthy lifestyle. What is more, it is much easier for people at early ages to form a habit of, for instance, not consuming too much fast food, over-fried food or intoxicants.In addition, it will be of economic benefit to pre-empt certain kinds of diseases. Needless to say, such unpreventable illnesses as cancer or HIV will cost the victim a fortune, not to cure, but to lengthen his longevity for 1 or 2 more years. Similarly, if humans tend to keep fit more regularly by participating in outdoor activities or using health-care product, obesity, myopia or other diseases that require expensive treatments will never stand a chance.To sum up, I have to concede to the materialistic diversion from treatment to health education and preventative measures. This will yield positive results on not only the people's physical and mental development but also their finance.";There is an increasing consensus that a sizeable portion of a country's health budget should be redirected from treatment-focused expenditures to health education and preventative measures. I strongly agree with this proposition for several reasons.Firstly, investing in health education equips individuals with the knowledge to make informed lifestyle choices. A well-informed populace is better prepared to prevent chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity, which are often linked to poor lifestyle choices. By prioritizing education on nutrition, exercise, and the dangers of smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, we can reduce the prevalence of these diseases and ultimately decrease treatment costs.Moreover, preventative measures, such as vaccinations and regular screenings, play a critical role in reducing the incidence of diseases before they necessitate more expensive treatments. For instance, increased funding for immunization programs can lead to lower rates of infectious diseases, thereby alleviating pressure on healthcare facilities and reducing hospital admission rates. The World Health Organization has long endorsed the effectiveness of preventative health measures, indicating their role in sustaining public health and ensuring economic stability.Additionally, the shift toward prevention over treatment could yield significant long-term financial benefits for governments. Although the initial investment in health education and preventative initiatives may be considerable, the reduction in healthcare costs associated with treating advanced diseases could help governments save substantial amounts. These savings can then be reinvested into further health initiatives or other sectors needing financial support.In conclusion, prioritizing health education and preventative measures over treatment alone is not only a prudent allocation of a nation’s health budget but also a necessary strategy for fostering a healthier society. Through such investments, countries can cultivate a more informed citizenry, reduce healthcare costs, and ultimately improve the overall quality of life for their populations.
376;University education should be restricted to the very besst academic students, rather than being available to a large proportion of young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Universtiy is an entrance to life. It equips us with a package of wisdom and virtue to succeed. It is the importance of university that raises a question whether students with best scholastic performance deserve university study or just any young wishful people. Both sides are to be discussed before a conclusion is reached.To begin with, outstanding academic students are eligible for university due to their intellectual advantage. To be precise, such abstract or complicated informatin, easily absorbed by those students, may prove as a matter of pressure for those who lack equivalent skills. Besides, it is undeniable that one deserves what he has done. University is like a gift presented to those who have gone to great length to attain.However, university is not just about academic studies but also a place to nurture artistic talent and develop soft skills. Therefore, it should be up for grabs for a majority of young people, who wish to pursue their passion as well as develop comprehensively. What is more, there is a tendency for social vices to rise if university is to be restricted to only the best people. Apart from the disheartened ones, many devoiding of neccessary preparations are likely to be recipes for failure when applying for jobs, mostly the white-collar ones.In conclusion, university restriction has both pros and cons. In my opinion, it will yield more negative results than positive ones. That's why it should be made available for a wide range of learners.;The debate surrounding the accessibility of university education has garnered significant attention in recent years. While there are arguments for restricting university admissions to the most academically proficient students, I contend that education should not be limited solely to the best academic performers, but rather made accessible to a broader audience for several reasons.Firstly, education is a fundamental right that contributes to personal and societal development. Restricting access to university education based on academic performance undermines the principle of equal opportunity. Many capable individuals who may not excel in traditional academic settings possess valuable skills and capabilities that can contribute to a diverse workforce. By allowing a wider range of students to pursue higher education, we foster creativity and innovation, essential qualities in a rapidly evolving job market.Additionally, universities serve as platforms for personal growth, critical thinking, and social development. Excluding potential students based solely on their academic records may deprive society of future leaders and changemakers who could emerge from non-traditional academic backgrounds. Many successful individuals, including entrepreneurs and innovators, have not always conformed to standard academic excellence. Their diverse perspectives can enhance the learning environment within universities, providing rich discussions that benefit all students.Furthermore, the job market increasingly values skills over academic credentials. As employers seek candidates with practical experience and soft skills, a broader university admission policy can help equip students with the diverse skill sets needed to thrive. Programs tailored to various aptitudes, such as vocational training and experiential learning, can empower students who may not fit the traditional academic mold.In conclusion, while academic excellence is an important consideration for university admission, restricting access solely to the most academically proficient students would limit potential and hinder the inclusive growth of society. Education should be seen as a pathway for all individuals, nurturing a diverse populace equipped for the complexities of the modern world.
377;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Parents are the best teachers. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answerÊ;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to who is the best teacher for children's education. Indeed, children grow up with two important people, their parents and teachers, and both are important in children's development. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the view that the teacher is the best option for children's education in some aspects. In the first place, school teachers are more qualified than parents in the field of education. For instance, to be able to obtain the teacher certificates, people need years of training at their normal schools to learn theoretical knowledge. However, in comparison to teachers, parents tend to have less knowledge to teach their children's subjects such as mathematics and physics.Furthermore, teaching staff are professional and experienced in terms of promoting children's communication skills. For example, after many years of teaching experience, teacher are able to know how to help children to develop important life skills such as learning personal boundaries, facing future problems and learning important conflict resolution skills. By contrast, parents are facing difficult generation gap with their children because they are less likely to know how to handle family conflicts in an efficient way. Last but not least, compared with teachers, parents do not have enough time to spend with their children. Nowadays we are facing a global economic crisis and it is necessary for both parents to work, hence there is only limited time for them to teach their children. Thus, it was impossible for them to be a good teacher.In conclusion, teachers are the best for children's education. Not only do they contribute much to children's professional skills but also they can teach their students important social communication techniques in order to survive in this competitive world.;"While the adage that ""parents are the best teachers"" holds truth in various contexts, I believe that while parents play a crucial role in education, they are not necessarily the best teachers in every capacity. The assertion deserves a nuanced exploration, considering both the strengths and limitations that parental instruction entails.Firstly, parents are pivotal in imparting foundational life skills. From an early age, they teach children essential skills such as walking, speaking, and social interaction. The lessons learned in the home often shape a child's character, values, and beliefs. For instance, parents instill concepts of kindness and respect, which serve as building blocks for responsible citizenship. Moreover, the emotional support and encouragement parents provide nurture a child’s self-esteem and motivation, essential for lifelong learning.However, while parents often excel in teaching morals and values, their ability to teach specific academic subjects may be limited. Many parents are not equipped with the latest educational methodologies or subject-specific knowledge that trained professionals possess. For example, a parent might struggle to teach advanced mathematics or science concepts effectively, which are crucial for academic success. Teachers in formal educational settings are specifically trained to address diverse learning styles and adapt their curriculum to benefit all students, an area where many parents may lack proficiency.Furthermore, the influence of peers and educators outside the home can offer diverse perspectives and knowledge that enrich a child's learning experience. School environments foster collaboration and critical thinking, skills that are essential in adult life.In conclusion, while parents undeniably lay the groundwork for their children’s education and personal development, it is essential to recognize that the educational landscape is broader than parental teaching alone. Collaboration between parents, educators, and peers creates a well-rounded educational experience, suggesting that no single source can claim the title of ""best teacher."""
378;When choosing a job, the salary is the most important consideration. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Along with the increasing physical demands of human life, salary has become the most influential consideration in defining careers of everyone. I personally suppose that there are still many other aspects which should be seen as important as income when people choose a job. In the following paragraphs, some of my viewpoints would be given and analyzed respectively.On one hand, i agree that money is very essential in order to meet human' basic needs. More specifically, people tend to choose high salary jobs so as to not only help themselves but also support partially or wholly their family's living needs such as food , clothes, accommodation, education, medication. It is obvious that people who are woking in art or painting industries, for example, will find it quite difficult to live comfortably and enjoyably. This is because they are doing what they love, their income however seems to be quite low compared to many other career paths.On the other hand, i believe that if we are passionate about what we are working, we are likely to achieve success easily in that field. There are plenty of people, who are now really successful, have started working in challenging as well as competitive fields as singers, dancers and painters. Besides, important factors in choosing a job such as level of happiness, satisfaction of jobs, personal relationships, professional skills, working environment, managers and colleagues should not be underestimated. Finally, some people choose a career due to their desire to help others and contribute positively to their countries and societies.In conclusion, it is undeniable that income is still a vital determination impacting us on choices of careers. Nonetheless, passion on jobs, in my opinion, can bring actual happiness and help us get promoted in working to earn even more money later on.;When it comes to selecting a job, salary often emerges as a paramount consideration for many individuals. While financial compensation is undeniably crucial, it is important to recognize that it is not the sole or even the most important factor for everyone when determining job satisfaction and career fulfillment.On one hand, a competitive salary provides security and stability, allowing individuals to support themselves and their families, as well as to achieve their personal financial goals. In a world where the cost of living continues to rise, particularly in urban areas, a higher salary can alleviate stress and contribute to a better quality of life. For many, the financial aspect is a primary motivator, especially for those in stages of life where financial burdens are significant, such as supporting children’s education or paying off debt.However, to suggest that salary is the most important consideration oversimplifies the complex decision-making process surrounding job selection. Other factors such as job satisfaction, work-life balance, opportunities for advancement, and the workplace culture play critical roles in ensuring long-term engagement and happiness in a role. For instance, individuals in creative fields or those passionate about social impacts often prioritize their work environment and job alignment with personal values over financial gain. A high-pressure job with a lucrative salary may lead to burnout if it lacks supportive management or a positive culture. Moreover, the importance of salary can vary depending on one's career stage or personal circumstances. A recent graduate may prioritize salary as they enter the job market, while someone with more experience may value job satisfaction or work conditions over a high salary.In conclusion, while salary is a significant consideration in job selection, it should not overshadow other vital aspects that contribute to a fulfilling work life. A balanced approach that considers both financial and personal satisfaction is essential for long-term career happiness.
379;The burning of oil for transportation, especially in private cars, is wasteful and environmentally irresponsible. Taxation on petrol and diesel fuel should be increased to very high levels to discourage the use of private cars. To what extent would you support or reject this idea?;There is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced. However, cars themselves, especially private ones, have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption. While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion.One can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile. Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries. Additionally, for those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities.However, taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation. To be precise, the more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable. Consequently, people have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis.Another point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially. Suppose that the those countries cut down on its oil support, other nations will have to pay more as well as release beneficial policies for them. America, for example, has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil.To summarize, higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons. However, it disadvantages may outweigh its advantages with regard to economic and politic issues, making it advisable to seek another options to reduce the use of personal cars.;The debate surrounding the taxation of petrol and diesel to discourage the use of private cars is a contentious one, bringing into sharp focus the intersection of environmental responsibility, economic considerations, and social equity. Increasing taxes on fossil fuels, particularly for transportation, is a strategy that I support to a significant extent. Firstly, the environmental argument is compelling. Burning fossil fuels for transportation is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, which exacerbate climate change and lead to severe ecological consequences. By imposing higher taxes on petrol and diesel, governments can incentivize individuals to seek alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit, cycling, or walking. This shift could significantly reduce carbon footprints, thereby contributing to global climate goals.Moreover, the revenue generated from higher fuel taxes can be channeled into developing sustainable infrastructure. Investments in public transport systems, cycling paths, and pedestrian-friendly urban planning can provide practical alternatives to car travel, making public transportation a viable option for more people. As a result, the reliance on private vehicles can diminish, leading to reduced traffic congestion and lower overall air pollution levels.That said, it is crucial to approach this issue with sensitivity toward socio-economic factors. Many individuals rely on private cars for their daily commute, particularly in rural or less accessible areas where public transport options are limited. A significant tax increase without adequate support systems in place may disproportionately impact lower-income families. Therefore, any tax policy should be complemented by measures such as subsidies for public transport, incentives for using electric vehicles, and investment in cleaner alternatives.In conclusion, while increasing taxes on petrol and diesel fuels can play a pivotal role in combating environmental challenges posed by private car use, it must be implemented thoughtfully, balancing ecological imperatives with social equity. This multifaceted approach can lead to a sustainable transportation future.
380;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The increasing number of street criminals leading to carrying guns in police force has become one of the most significant issues that many people of today's society are very concerned for. Few individuals assume that this trend reflects and enhances the high level of violence in society. I totally agree with this viewpoint for some specific reasons which would be given and analyzed in the following paragraphs.First of all, we need to consider that police armed with guns or any other kinds of legal weapons just attempts to protect not only civilians but also himself. As a result, criminals todays are very sophisticated so they spend a large amount of money to acquire modern weapons to cope with the police and serve their own nefarious needs. Thus, citizens in that society can be shot by both police and offenders accidentally. Moreover, while on duty, not only are private citizens affected but facilities such as cars, houses, streets are likely to be destroyed by guns. Therefore, a society that its police force carries guns will be definitely seen as a highly violent one.Secondly, police force carries guns only in high crime societies. Hence, people and police in those ones usually deal with dangerous diverse crime's categories such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, arson. Obviously, Those are possibly the strongest evidences to determine a society suffering a high level of violence.In conclusion, from the above views, although being armed with guns in the police force is necessary, it will bring the higher level of violence. Additionally, the government should to impose strict laws in carrying weapons as well as give professional training to them in order to avoid any influence on civilians' lives.;"The question of whether arming police forces leads to higher levels of violence in society is a contentious issue that requires careful examination. On one hand, there is a compelling argument that the presence of firearms may escalate tensions in encounters between law enforcement and civilians, contributing to an environment where violence is more likely to occur. When police are equipped with guns, it may create a perception of threat and escalate confrontations, leading to a cycle of violence. For instance, incidents of police shootings have sparked widespread protests and civil unrest, suggesting that communities often feel intimidated rather than protected when armed officers are present.Conversely, proponents of police armament argue that firearms are essential for law enforcement to effectively deal with violent crime and ensure public safety. In situations where officers face significant threats, such as armed robberies or terrorist attacks, the ability to respond with lethal force can be crucial. In this view, rather than creating violence, armed police serve as a deterrent against criminal activity by ensuring that law enforcement has the necessary tools to respond to dangerous situations.Ultimately, the impact of armed police on societal violence may depend on various factors, including training, accountability, and community relations. Proper training in de-escalation techniques and community engagement tends to correlate with lower instances of violence. Furthermore, transparency and accountability measures can help to build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. Therefore, while the presence of firearms may contribute to increased violence in some contexts, it is not solely the act of carrying guns that dictates societal violence; rather, it is the broader systemic issues surrounding policing that must also be addressed. In conclusion, I believe that while arming police can contribute to a culture of violence, it is the societal context, training, and community relationships that play a crucial role in determining whether this armed presence becomes a source of conflict or a protector of public safety."
381;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? With the help of technology, students nowadays can learn more information and learn it more quickly. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Nowadays, technology plays an indispensable role in almost all spheres of life. In education, it is believed that technology help the students improve their scholastic performances. From my viewpoint, the richness as well as convenience of technology are two main factors that contribute to the students' progress.To start with, since technology was introduced, student have been exposed to a wide range of information, which neccessarily broaden their minds. The internet, for example, provide knowledge in the form of news, radio talks, tapes or reseachs on any particular fields. There, the students can not only ascertain concerned subjects but they can also get access to relevant issues and discuss with people worldwide.Another point that students may benefit from technology is the shortened time for learning. The modern world provides learners with the mp3, the mobile phone or the laptop that help them, especially language learners, listen to recordings everywhre or read documents anytime. Therefore, students will develop their skills at a greater pace. Moreover, the internet again, is an inexhaustible resource of visual aids, such as educational games, sounds or images with which students may absorb abstract concepts taught at school more briskly and thoroughly.On balance, I have to consent to the use of technology in education, as it expedites data availability and accelarates students' learning process. It is highly recommended that apart from education, technology should be applied in every aspect of life which assures of a better future.;In today’s digital age, technology has profoundly transformed the educational landscape, enabling students to access vast amounts of information more swiftly than ever before. I firmly agree with the statement that, with the help of technology, students can learn more while also accelerating their learning process.Firstly, the internet serves as an immense reservoir of knowledge. With a few clicks, students can access online databases, scholarly articles, and educational platforms like Khan Academy, Coursera, and YouTube. This breadth of resources allows learners to delve into subjects in greater depth and from varied perspectives. For instance, a student studying biology can watch tutorials, read scientific papers, and engage in interactive simulations, all of which enrich their understanding beyond traditional textbooks.Moreover, technology fosters personalized learning experiences. Platforms powered by artificial intelligence can adapt to a learner’s style and pace, identifying strengths and weaknesses to tailor educational content accordingly. For example, platforms such as Duolingo use gamified lessons to teach languages, allowing students to progress through levels at their own pace, thereby enhancing retention and engagement.Additionally, collaborative tools and social media platforms facilitate communication and knowledge-sharing among peers. Students can easily form study groups or engage in discussions on forums, cementing their understanding through collaborative learning. The ability to pose questions in real time on platforms like Stack Exchange or social media further enriches the learning process, expediting clarification and fostering a culture of inquiry.In conclusion, the integration of technology in education undoubtedly empowers students to learn more efficiently. By providing instant access to information, enabling personalized learning experiences, and promoting collaboration, technology equips students with the tools necessary for effective learning in today's fast-paced world. As we continue to embrace these digital advancements, the potential for educational growth remains limitless.
382;Human have made a great technological process in the last hundred years. However, this progress has negative effects on people's lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;It is undeniable that technological process has brought numerous benefits making human life become more and more comfortable and easy. Some individuals assume that this technological development also causes many drawbacks impacting seriously on our lives. I personally disagree with this view. In the following paragraphs, both sides of the above matter as well as my own view's explanations would be analyzed and given, respectively.Firstly, it is undoubtedly that thanks to modern technology invented recently, human life has been improved dramatically. Air-conditioners, computers, cellphones, washing machines, for example, is likely to be seen as greatest inventions helping people to reduce stress and time for other activities. Moreover, applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients' lives.However, some negative aspects of technological process need to be mentioned clearly. In spite of bring fantastic advantages, technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process. This is because exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously. Last but not least, technology may decrease a great deal of creativity in certain groups of people especially children and the youth due to the dependence upon available achievements.In conclusion, I totally believe that technology has a great contribution to our lives and civilization. We can not neglect profound impact of great technological process on human life. Nonetheless, its adverse effects need controlling more reasonably.;Over the last century, humanity has witnessed unparalleled technological advancements that have revolutionized various aspects of life. From medical breakthroughs to the advent of the internet, these developments have undoubtedly improved overall quality of life. However, alongside these positive changes, there are significant negative effects that cannot be overlooked.One of the most profound impacts of technological progress is the enhancement of medical science, which has led to increased life expectancy and improved health outcomes. Vaccines and advanced treatments for previously lethal diseases have saved millions of lives. However, this has also resulted in overpopulation and subsequently intensified competition for resources, leading to environmental degradation and increased carbon emissions. The very technologies that allow us to live longer also contribute to existential threats, such as climate change.Additionally, technology has transformed communication and work environments, heralding the rise of remote work and global connectivity. While this fosters collaboration and accessibility, it has also led to a blurring of the lines between personal and professional life. Many individuals now experience heightened stress and burnout due to constant connectivity, which negatively impacts mental health. Social media, touted as a tool for connection, has been linked to increased isolation and anxiety among users, particularly among younger generations.Moreover, the rapid pace of automation poses a threat to job security, as machines and algorithms replace human labor across various sectors. While efficiency may increase, this transition creates economic instability and widens the gap between skilled and unskilled workers. The resulting unemployment and underemployment can lead to socioeconomic challenges and increased inequality.In conclusion, while technological progress has facilitated significant advancements that enhance quality of life, it is imperative to recognize the associated negative consequences. Striking a balance between embracing innovation and mitigating its adverse effects is crucial for fostering a sustainable future for humanity. Thus, I believe that the benefits of technology must be tempered with awareness and proactive measures to address its drawbacks.
383;There is a large amount of violence in television programs we should reduce. Do you agree or disagree?;"Excessive violence in television programs has been one of the major concerns facing society. Reducing such contents from TV shows is the widely accepted solution endorsed by the majority of governments throughout the world today. Personally, I believe that governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable. Admittedly, reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate. However, in order to tackle this problem more effectively, governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children’s television programs. As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. Little wonder, then, that by watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes. Therefore, it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies.Nevertheless, it would certainly be a violation of adults’ civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences. Frequently, adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day. For whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment. Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them. In conclusion, it is my belief that violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency; however, the adults should not be the victim of this policy.";Television has long been a powerful medium that shapes societal norms and influences behavior. The presence of violence in television programs has sparked considerable debate regarding its impact on viewers, particularly among children and adolescents. I firmly agree that there is a large amount of violence in television programs that should be reduced.One of the primary concerns regarding violent content is its potential to desensitize viewers. Constant exposure to aggressive behavior can lead to a numbing effect, making individuals more tolerant of violence in real life. Studies have shown that children who consume media with high levels of violence are more likely to exhibit aggressive behavior themselves, as they may come to see violent actions as an acceptable means of solving conflicts. This cycle of learning can foster a culture in which violence is normalized, perpetuating harmful behaviors across generations.Moreover, the sensationalism surrounding violence in television often overshadows its consequences. Programs tend to dramatize violence without addressing the real-life ramifications families and communities endure. Such depictions can create a distorted perception of reality, wherein violent acts are trivialized and glamorized. Reducing violence in television could pave the way for more nuanced storytelling that emphasizes empathy, problem-solving, and moral dilemmas, thereby encouraging viewers to engage with complex issues rather than resorting to simplistic portrayals of conflict.Another aspect that warrants attention is the responsibility of content creators. They wield significant power over what audiences, particularly impressionable young viewers, consume. By actively choosing to limit violent content, creators can contribute to a healthier media landscape that promotes positive behavior and fosters understanding among viewers.In conclusion, while television can be a source of entertainment and escapism, the alarming amount of violence depicted warrants a critical reassessment. Reducing violent portrayals would not only protect vulnerable audiences but also promote a culture that values empathy and constructive conflict resolution over aggression. Ultimately, fostering a more responsible media environment benefits society as a whole.
384;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The number of criminality is increase rapidly throughout the world. Some inhabitants argue that this case appears because the guns are always used by a police to solve a criminal act. Personally, I tend to disagree with this statement, while I believe that other factors contribute a slight incline level of violence.On the one hand, I agree that a police holds a responsibility to tackle of violence in the urban or suburban areas using a gun. An obvious example of this happens in The United State, a man killed more than ten people in the cinema using a weapon, while a police shot in the foot to paralyze him. Obviously, police officers can force a criminal to surrender, because they have a weapon which will prevent an escaping criminal who poses a serious danger to the public. As a result, some military weapons need encouraging for police officers to protect the public and minimize the rate of violence.On the other hand, there are some reason why the level of bloody increases significantly in the communities. Firstly, the number of unemployment rate has risen to 15 percent in several globalized and non-globalized countries. Many well-qualified and well-educated person cannot earn some money to live comfortably. Secondly, cost of living in the big city is extremely expensive, so this problem impresses some people who live under the poverty line to do anything to pay their basic needs. Many baggers chose to be a pickpocket in the public transport, for instance.In conclusion, it seems to me that the guns which are used by police have not been a trigger of higher level of violence. However, some cases occupy a crucial reason to do a criminality in society such unemployment. In my view, the main focus is decreasing a level of unemployment to avoid a criminal act.;The debate surrounding the arming of police forces has garnered significant attention, with opinions often polarized on whether such practices lead to increased levels of violence within society. While it is understandable that some argue armed police foster a culture of violence, I contend that the relationship between police arming and societal violence is not straightforward and depends on various contextual factors.Proponents of the view that armed police encourage violence often cite the possibility of escalating confrontations. The presence of firearms can create an atmosphere of fear and tension, potentially leading to violent encounters. For instance, in societies where police are perceived as heavily militarized, citizens may respond with hostility, fearing for their safety and autonomy. This can create a vicious cycle where both police and civilians are on heightened alert, leading to situations where non-lethal engagements escalate into deadly confrontations.However, it is essential to consider the effectiveness of armed police in maintaining public order. In high-crime areas, the presence of armed law enforcement can deter violence and crime by signaling a clear stance against illegal activities. Moreover, properly trained and accountable armed police forces can respond to dangerous situations more effectively than their unarmed counterparts, thus potentially preventing violence in critical scenarios.Moreover, the societal context heavily influences outcomes. Countries with a strong emphasis on police training, community relations, and accountability often experience a decrease in violence despite police being armed. Conversely, in societies plagued by corruption and a lack of oversight, arming the police can exacerbate violence.In conclusion, while there is a valid concern that armed police may encourage violence, this issue is complex and context-dependent. The effectiveness of an armed police force relies heavily on training, accountability, and the broader societal dynamics at play. To truly address and mitigate violence, a multifaceted approach that goes beyond merely arming the police is essential.
385;Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child's success in school. Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;"It goes without saying that no pupil can succeed at school unassisted. Their success should be attributed to many different external factors. It is argued that parents who are the closet to children mainly contribute to their accomplishments. However, in my opinion, the classmates should be regarded as the most important influence on individual achievements.To begin with, the classmates themselves creat a competitive atmoshphere which incent the children. In high school, for instance, an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same. From a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children, which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children's academic performances.To add up, when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such, classmates are second to none. It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents, explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others; it can be, for example, lessons on the class, social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents. Sharing the same age, children are at their most comfort to exchange ideas, to query and interpret abstract concepts without fear of parental punishments, resulting in deeper comprehension.All advantages considered, classmates are unrivalled by the children's parents as they provide tremendous incentive and horizon expansion, two crucial commodities leading to a successful presentation at school.";The question of whether classmates exert a more significant influence than parents on a child's success in school is complex. While peers undoubtedly play a crucial role during childhood and adolescence, I ultimately disagree with the statement. In my view, parents remain the most important influence on a child's academic achievements for several reasons.Firstly, parents are a child's primary educators and role models. From the earliest formative years, they instill values, habits, and attitudes toward education. For example, a parent who prioritizes reading and engages their child in educational activities lays the groundwork for a strong academic foundation. This foundational support from parents fosters a child’s curiosity and encourages a love for learning, which can significantly influence future success in school.Additionally, parents provide emotional and financial support that is vital for academic achievement. They create a stable environment where a child can thrive. For instance, parents who encourage their children to pursue extracurricular activities, seek help when needed, and maintain a balanced lifestyle directly impact their children’s performance. When faced with academic challenges, it is often the guidance of parents that helps children persevere rather than the influence of peers.On the other hand, while classmates can influence a child’s social skills and motivation, this impact is often heavily moderated by parental involvement. Children may seek validation and a sense of belonging from their peers, but this quest is influenced by the values and confidence instilled by their parents. When children feel secure and supported at home, they are better equipped to navigate peer pressure and focus on their studies.In conclusion, although classmates undeniably play a role in shaping a child’s school experience, parents remain the more critical influence on a child’s academic success. The foundation laid by parental involvement, support, and guidance is irreplaceable in fostering a child's achievement in school.
386;Living in big cities is bad for people's health. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Today, more and more people are moving to big cities to live. However, while life in those cities is good in some ways, I completely argue that people's health would therefore be affected negatively.Environment pollution one of the primary reasons why life in cities is becoming worse than ever before. Exhaust from transportation, especially cars, and factories' tosix fumes can lead people to face with various respiratory deseases. Besides, water pollution makes people's health become more critical. The fact is that dangerous bacterias and germs in polluted water can go indirectly into people's bodies and create severe problems, which may result in death if the patients are not treated in time. Moreover, it is likely that many foods in big cities are not safe for people to eat or drink. Recent investigations reveal that toxic foods are sold pervasively in today's market. Also, overpopulation may make people suffer from infectious deseases, especially cough, sneezing and illness. Furthermore, living in such cities also means living in high crime rate areas. Unemployed workers or school dropouts can easily commit crime from petty offence to felony such as burglary, pickpocketing, trickery, vandalism, smuggling or even murder. Earning money for living becomes more difficult, living healthy in such places is getting harder also.In conclusion, I believe that life in big cities can have negative effects on people's health. Thus, both government and individual should take steps to diminish the consequences involved.;"The proposition that living in large cities is detrimental to people's health is a multifaceted issue, one that warrants careful examination. While there are compelling arguments supporting this viewpoint, it is also important to consider the potential benefits that urban living can offer.On one hand, big cities are often associated with a range of health challenges. Air pollution is a significant concern; urban areas typically have higher concentrations of harmful pollutants due to heavy traffic, industrial activities, and construction. Prolonged exposure to such pollutants can lead to respiratory problems, cardiovascular diseases, and other health issues. Additionally, the noise pollution prevalent in bustling metropolises can intensify stress levels, disrupt sleep, and exacerbate mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression. Moreover, the fast-paced lifestyle in cities can lead to unhealthy habits, such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and insufficient leisure time, which can have long-term implications on physical health.Conversely, living in big cities can also provide certain health advantages. Urban environments often have better access to healthcare facilities and specialized medical services. Residents may benefit from a greater variety of health resources, including fitness centers, wellness programs, and mental health services. Furthermore, cities tend to promote social interaction and community engagement, which are vital for mental well-being. Public transportation and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure can encourage active lifestyles, enabling residents to walk or cycle more frequently compared to those in rural settings.In conclusion, while the health risks associated with urban living, such as pollution and lifestyle factors, cannot be overlooked, it is crucial to recognize the access to healthcare and opportunities for active living that big cities can provide. Therefore, rather than outright agreeing with the notion that city living is bad for health, a nuanced perspective is necessary, acknowledging both the challenges and advantages inherent in urban environments."
387;Some people believe that if a police force carries guns, this encourages higher level of violence in that society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Some people may argue that allowing policemen to carries firearms can increase violence in the society. To some extent, I do not agree with this assertion because I believe that criminal minds that breed violence not stringent gun control. First of all, it seems to be true that if there is gun control somehow crime has to decrease because fewer guns available mean less crime. However, this is not as simple as it sounds. In fact, stringent gun control does not decrease violence and crime because most gun violence is committed with guns obtained illegally. People who are intent to commit crime and control cities through gang violence and other means will find a way to continue to use guns, regardless of gun control. Moreover, there will be law non-abiding people anywhere in the world, either polices or common citizens. As a result, the root of violence is criminal mind not the weapon itself. Therefore, if a government wants to control crime in a community, it is important to manage their people's actions rather than gun used in violent crimes. All in all, it is obvious that there is a poor relationship between polices carrying guns and an increasing violence rate. On the other hand, criminal mind seems to be more related to violence. Consequently, we should pay more attention to adjust people's behaviors in order to reduce crimes instead of gun control.;"The debate over whether armed police forces contribute to heightened societal violence is complex and multifaceted. At one end of the spectrum, proponents of disarming police argue that the mere presence of firearms can escalate tensions in everyday encounters. This argument stems from the assertion that when police officers are armed, civilians may feel threatened, leading to an adversarial atmosphere rather than one of trust and cooperation. Instances abound where police encounters have turned violent, leading to tragic outcomes, particularly in communities already grappling with systemic issues.However, it is essential to consider the potential benefits of an armed police force. Guns can serve as a deterrent against violent crimes, thereby enhancing public safety. In high-crime areas, officers being equipped with firearms may enable them to deal effectively with armed offenders, potentially preventing violent confrontations. Many argue that police officers are trained professionals who should be equipped to handle dangerous situations to protect themselves and the public.Moreover, the correlation between armed policing and increased violence is not straightforward. In some countries where police are unarmed, violence can still be rampant, driven by factors such as socio-economic inequality and lack of access to resources. Besides, it is not solely the presence of weapons that generates violence; the underlying social context, including systemic injustices and community trust, plays a crucial role.In conclusion, while there may be valid concerns regarding the potential for increased violence stemming from an armed police force, it is overly simplistic to assert that carrying guns is the primary cause of societal violence. A more nuanced approach is essential, one that balances the necessity for public safety with community trust. Ultimately, fostering a culture of accountability, training, and engagement between police and civilians is crucial for addressing violence, irrespective of whether officers are armed."
388;Education is the single most important factor in the development of a country. Do you agree?;Education is undeniably an economic necessity. In most countries, it makes up a considerable part of its national budget yearly. In highly industrialized countries, undertakings are made to make it accessible and affordable to all. I believe that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country.In a developing country, not many can afford to send their children to school. There are government schools where tuition fees are practically free but they are not aplenty and mostly are situated in the cities. They are not reachable by children who live in the mountains or islands. These children whose parents are either farmers or fishermen, can hardly eat three meals a day, let alone afford to pay for transportation to get to these schools everyday. As a result, these children remain uneducated and will have the same fate as their parents.Development through education does not necessarily mean raising a country full of doctors, lawyers or engineers. Basic education teaches one child to read and write. Supplementary education provides him with useful knowledge and information. A further specific education can teach an individual with skills enough to make a living and be self-sufficient. A well-informed man can act sensibly and make sound judgment. In the same way, a skillful man contributes favorably and is valuable to the society. Collectively, the benefits of education can make a man, a society and a developed country.In conclusion, education plays an important role in the socioeconomic status of a country. The more people in the country become educated, the better chance it can develop.;Education is indeed one of the most critical factors in the development of a country. It provides individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to participate effectively in the workforce and society. A well-educated population is vital for fostering economic growth, promoting social equity, and enhancing political stability. Firstly, education directly contributes to the economic development of a nation. An educated workforce is essential for innovation and productivity. Countries with higher literacy rates tend to have more significant economic output, as they can leverage technological advancements and improve efficiency in various sectors. For instance, nations that invest heavily in education, such as Finland and Japan, consistently rank high in global economic performance. This correlation highlights how education acts as a catalyst for economic stability and growth.Moreover, education plays a key role in promoting social equity. It empowers marginalized groups and reduces inequality by providing opportunities for upward mobility. When citizens can access quality education, they are more likely to secure better jobs, leading to improved living standards and a reduction in poverty rates. This is particularly crucial in developing countries, where education can serve as a powerful tool to break the cycle of poverty and promote social justice.Furthermore, education is fundamental to enhancing political stability and civic participation. An informed and educated citizenry is more likely to engage in democratic processes and hold governments accountable. Education fosters critical thinking and encourages individuals to question and challenge injustices, contributing to a more active and responsible populace.In conclusion, while other factors such as governance, infrastructure, and natural resources are significant, education stands out as the bedrock of a nation's development. Investing in education not only cultivates a skilled workforce but also nurtures informed citizens who can drive social change and foster economic growth. Therefore, I firmly agree that education is the single most important factor in the development of a country.
389;Nowadays celebrities are more famous for their glamour and wealth than for their achievements and this sets a bad example for young people. To what extent to you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people argue that adolescents are being influenced badly by untalented people who become famous thanks to their luxurious lifestyle and wealth. To some extent, I do not agree with this statement.First of all, it is true that people use their money to become an inspiration are definitely not a good mirror for young people. We definitely do not want our children to spend money on luxurious custom or lifestyle just to be similar to someone, especially when these people are not symbols of any talent but showing off. However, the young generation these days is very conscious toward positive lifestyles. They are mostly being educated at very early ages by family or schools as to distinguish what is benefit for them. Therefore, it is not easy to influence young people these days when they are well equipped of life skills. Moreover, it seems to me that not many people can exist in the celebrities' world without any talents or achievements. We are giving chances to many teenagers to show their intelligence in different talent shows, for example; The Voice, X Factor or Next Top Models etc. As a result, to become a star and an inspiration for people, a person need to have real talent to compete with other candidates. Thus, only money and glamour look are not enough for a person to be recognized anymore, it is importance that they have to have achievements in order to be a muse to youngsters. In conclusion, people without talents cannot be famous in this changing world and to be accredited they need to contribute positively to young generation. That is the reason why celebrities nowadays give more good influence on young people than they were previously.";In today’s society, the notion of celebrity has evolved dramatically. More than ever, individuals in the public eye seem to garner recognition primarily for their glamour, wealth, and lifestyle choices rather than their genuine achievements or contributions to society. This paradigm shift raises questions about the implications for young people who idolize these figures.On one hand, it is evident that many celebrities are celebrated more for their extravagant lives than for their talents or hard work. Reality television stars, social media influencers, and even some musicians and actors often achieve fame through sensationalism rather than substantial accomplishments. This phenomenon can foster unrealistic expectations among youth regarding success, as they may equate fame with fortune rather than dedication and perseverance. Young people might feel pressured to seek instant gratification through flashy lifestyles, neglecting the value of hard work and resilience.Moreover, the portrayal of wealth and glamour can perpetuate a materialistic culture that prioritizes appearances over character. As young individuals increasingly turn to social media for inspiration and role models, they may find themselves drawn to superficial indicators of success. This shift in values could lead to a generation that emphasizes personal branding and social status over genuine talent or contributions to society.However, it is essential to recognize that not all celebrities fit this mold. Many use their platforms to advocate for important issues, inspire positive change, or promote artistic endeavors. These figures illustrate that fame can be coupled with meaningful achievements and contribute positively to society.In conclusion, while it is indisputable that many celebrities are celebrated for their wealth and glamour rather than their achievements, this trend presents significant risks to the values and aspirations of young people. It is crucial to encourage a broader understanding of success that emphasizes hard work, talent, and ethical contributions to society. Balancing celebrity culture with critical analysis can help cultivate a more sustainable and inspiring vision for future generations.
390;Some people argue that the technology such as mobile phone (cell phone) destroys social interaction. Do you agree or disagree?;Recently, there has been a social concern with regard to whether or not mobiles phones have negative effects on our social life. Indeed, mobile phones have widely been used by people of all ages. However, I believe, this great invention in the 21st century causes many problems in our society.In the first place, spending too much time on mobiles phones many exert an adverse effect on our social skills. For example, as people, especially teenagers increasingly tend to focus on their phones, they may lose their interests on daily activities such as meeting with friends, and this lack of communication may impair their future negotiation and interpersonal skills. Moreover, continuous use of mobile phones may also damage children's eyesight and physical posture. As a result, it is harmful for us to use mobile phones frequently.Furthermore, the growing number of mobiles games will impact their mental development. For instance, there many game applications available online and many of them are quite aggressive in nature. In these games, children are rewarded to help their characters to kill or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players, and this many lead to development of aggressive feelings, thoughts and behaviors. Consequently, frequent conflicts may occur during communication.However, we may perceive this issue from different viewpoints. Mobile phones , such as smart phones, has made our communication easy and convenience. The reason is that, as most of the telecommunication companies provide us with access to the internet via our phones, people are able to enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls free of charge. Thus, mobile phones have shortened the distance of communication. To sum up, although mobile phones make our communication faster, it also gives rise to many social problems such as children's social skills and their mental health. Therefore, i highly advocate that we should use mobile phone in moderation in order to avoid these serious problems.;In contemporary society, the debate surrounding the influence of technology, particularly mobile phones, on social interaction persists. While some individuals contend that mobile phones detrimentally affect personal connections, I argue that they enhance social interaction by fostering communication, connectivity, and the sharing of experiences.Mobile phones have revolutionized the way we communicate. With the advent of instant messaging apps and social media platforms, people can now connect with friends and family regardless of geographical constraints. This seamless communication allows for stronger relationships, as individuals can share their lives through photographs, texts, and video calls, providing a sense of closeness even when miles apart. For instance, family members living in different countries can keep in touch regularly, preserving relationships that might otherwise fade due to distance.Moreover, mobile technology has facilitated the formation of new relationships. Online communities and social networking sites enable people with shared interests to connect, thus broadening their social horizons. Individuals can find support groups, make new friends, and engage in discussions that might not be possible in their immediate physical environment. This expanded network can enhance one’s social life and create opportunities for meaningful interactions.Critics often point to the phenomenon of individuals being engrossed in their phones while in social settings, leading to a perceived decline in face-to-face interaction. However, it is crucial to recognize that this behavior is not inherently a product of mobile phones, but rather a reflection of how we choose to use technology. It is possible for individuals to strike a balance between appreciating the advantages of mobile communication and remaining present in physical interactions.In conclusion, while mobile phones can sometimes disrupt in-person communication, they predominantly serve as tools that enhance social interaction. By facilitating connections, enabling new friendships, and allowing for continuous engagement, mobile technology plays a crucial role in enriching our social lives. Thus, rather than viewing mobile phones purely as a detriment, we should embrace their potential to connect us more deeply with others.
391;The environment problems facing today's world are so great that there is little ordinary people can do to improve the situation. Government and large companies should be responsible for reducing the amount of damage being done to the environment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;Nowadays, many countries are concerned with the environment problems. There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that. Personally, I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment, but we need to analyze some specific situations.On one hand, solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies, and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems. For example, air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries, and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution, while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances. However, individuals are unable to cope with these things.Besides, the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people. It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection. This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society, and the government controls many influential media, such as TV stations and newspapers, which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens.On the other hand, it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection, and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment. For instance, many people driving private cars could cause air pollution, and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment. If people can gradually change some lifestyles in these daily activities, this will have many significant impacts on environmental improvement.In conclusion, the government and corporations should take more responsibility for addressing environmental issues, but every citizen also can contribute to the environment.;The pressing environmental problems facing today's world, from climate change to biodiversity loss, are undeniably daunting. While it is easy to conclude that the magnitude of these issues places the onus of responsibility on governments and large companies, I contend that this perspective overlooks the significant role that ordinary individuals can play in driving change. Firstly, it is essential to recognize that governments and corporations have substantial influence and resources to address environmental issues. They control policies, regulations, and large-scale industrial practices that contribute to ecological degradation. For instance, environmental legislation aimed at reducing carbon emissions or protecting natural habitats often hinges on governmental action. Similarly, corporations have the power to adopt sustainable practices and innovate eco-friendly technologies, impacting their supply chains and consumer behavior.However, to solely entrust these entities with the responsibility of improving the environmental situation ignores the critical grassroots movements led by ordinary people. Individuals have the ability to effect change in their local communities, promote sustainable behaviors, and inspire others. Initiatives like community clean-ups, local recycling programs, and advocacy for sustainable local policies underscore how individuals can contribute positively. When ordinary people actively make eco-conscious choices—such as reducing waste or supporting sustainable businesses—they send a powerful message that can influence corporate practices and encourage governmental action.Moreover, fostering a culture of environmental consciousness among individuals creates a foundation for long-term change. When citizens demand cleaner policies and practices, it pressures governments and corporates to reform. Therefore, rather than viewing responsibility as a binary choice between individuals or institutions, it should be seen as a shared duty. In conclusion, while governments and large companies play pivotal roles in addressing environmental issues, ordinary people also possess the power to create meaningful change. It is through collective effort that we can tackle environmental challenges effectively and sustainably.
392;Detailed description of crimes on newspaper and TV can have bad consequences on society, so this kind of information should be restricted on media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Nowadays, the print as well as the electronic media tend to dedicate large amounts of airtime and space to detailed reports about crimes. Personally, I believe such details should be strictly censored, if not banned altogether.It is widely known that the press provide the public with criminal content in order to increase newspaper circulation and TV rating. These days the primary purpose of journalists covering the details of criminal acts is, more often than that, to boost newspaper circulations and TV ratings. Consequently, a great deal of crime coverage is rather biased, exaggerated or fraudulent, which only result to terrorize communities and leave law-aiding people increasingly apprehensive of about crimes.An even more detrimental fact is that detailed reports of crimes exposured on the press may provide the potential criminals with instructive learning materials, which would be hard to obtain otherwise. This may help those who are in the process of panning a criminal act perfect their plans, avoid the pitfalls and make themselves harder to be tracked down by the police. Thus, without the prevention on criminal details, the unlawful behavior would be more and more severe and the social harmony would be broken.Most importantly, particular coverage of heinous crimes may further traumatize the victims of crimes because they have already suffered greatly for what they have experienced. Without their consent, this could only add to theses innocent people's mental suffering and they may do some extreme actions.In conclusion, I strongly hold my point that any descriptions of crimes should not go unchecked as any longer, as they may be false, may further drive up the already-high crime rate and may bring even more suffering to the victims of crimes.;"The portrayal of crime in newspapers and on television is a contentious issue, with arguments for both unrestricted reporting and the imposition of limitations. While the media plays a critical role in informing the public, the detailed description of crimes can indeed have harmful consequences on society, leading to an argument for restricting such information.Firstly, the relentless focus on crime can instigate a heightened sense of fear and anxiety within communities. When the media emphasizes violent acts or sensationalizes criminal behavior, it can create a perception that crime is more prevalent than it may actually be. This phenomenon, often referred to as the ""mean world syndrome,"" can lead to an increase in societal paranoia and mistrust among individuals, which in turn can impact social cohesion and community relationships. Such fear may compel individuals to take unnecessary precautions, further isolating themselves and diminishing communal engagement.Moreover, graphic depictions of crime or detailed accounts can arguably desensitize the public to violence. When audiences are constantly exposed to accounts of brutality and crime, they may become numb to its ramifications, leading to a decrease in empathy for victims and normalization of violence. This desensitization can also influence individuals’ behavior, particularly impressionable youth who might begin to view criminal actions as acceptable or even glamorous.On the other hand, it is essential to consider the role of media as a watchdog that keeps the public informed about societal issues. Restricting information could impede transparency and the ability to hold institutions accountable.In conclusion, while the media serves a vital function in society, the consequences of detailed crime reporting necessitate careful consideration. Balancing the public’s right to know with the potential societal harms of sensationalized crime reporting could involve implementing guidelines that promote responsible journalism, ultimately fostering an informed yet safe community."
393;Some people say that in our modern age, it is unnecessary to teach children about the skills of handwriting. To what extent do you agree or disagree;In this age of modern technology, some people usually underestimate the importance of teaching handwriting for children. To some people, it is considered as an arduous and time consuming task. From my point of view, children are those who need to be under instruction of handwriting for several reasons.Despite the convenience from up-to-date facilities, handwriting still plays a vital role in students' learning. Firstly, this approach is a basis tool used in several fields such as taking notes, doing homework and writing. It enables to improve learners' spelling capacity and accompany reading or writing disabilities as well. Under the guidance of parents or teachers, children can benefit from practicing handwriting. This way of writing will encourage them to pay more attention on content, elaborate in details and develop their organization abilities.Secondly, parents and schools should give priority on directing their kids about handwriting as poor handwriting can have a negative impact on students' school performance. The fact is that kids who are bad at handwriting meet difficulties in taking notes and catching up lessons. It resulted in the missing of information and the lack of details during their works. Moreover, the increasing taking advantage of advanced equipment could make students be lazier and more subjective in their writing skills. For example, with the assistance of automatic grammar and spelling checking in office word, learners are now no need for noticing much in their mistakes. To conclude, no matter how fast and convenient modern devices bring to us in writing, handwriting is still a needed skill for all of people, especially students at the early age.;In the contemporary era, the debate surrounding the necessity of teaching handwriting skills to children has gained momentum. While the advent of technology has transformed how we communicate, I contend that teaching handwriting remains an essential skill for several reasons.Firstly, handwriting is integral to cognitive development. Research indicates that the act of writing by hand engages different parts of the brain than typing, aiding in the retention and understanding of information. Learning to write enhances fine motor skills, improves memory, and encourages creativity. These cognitive benefits cannot be replicated through typing alone, underscoring the importance of handwriting in early education.Moreover, handwritten communication fosters a personal touch that digital correspondence often lacks. In a world dominated by emails and instant messaging, a handwritten note or letter can convey thoughtfulness and authenticity. The ability to express oneself through handwriting is a crucial social skill that has enduring value, particularly in personal relationships and professional settings where conveying emotion and sincerity is important.Additionally, the role of handwriting in examinations and academic settings cannot be overlooked. While digital tools may dominate in many environments, the ability to write legibly and coherently by hand remains a requisite skill in many educational systems. Handwritten responses in exams can demonstrate a student's understanding and critical thinking abilities, and the capacity to organize thoughts on paper is imperative in developing effective communication skills.Furthermore, the creative aspect of handwriting should not be disregarded. The uniqueness of an individual's writing style can contribute to their personal identity, and this expression can foster self-esteem and a sense of ownership over one’s work.In conclusion, despite the increasing reliance on technology, I argue that teaching handwriting is still vital. It serves not just practical purposes, but also supports cognitive development, social interaction, and personal expression. Thus, it is essential for educational curriculums to maintain a focus on handwriting skills for the holistic development of children.
394;Families who send their children to private schools should not be required to pay taxes that support the state education system. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;"Some people who send their children to private schools contend that the amount of taxes they pay for the state education is unreasonable. However, I am utterly convinced that these taxes are absolutely essential.Firstly, by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor. It is true that many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course. With the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life.Secondly, the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital. Obviously, this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation; therefore, the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue. In addition, the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care.Many parents supporting for the idea of tax discounts claim that such tax payments are unfair for them. They point out that it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use. Nevertheless, we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade. We certainly do not hope for a reduction for these sorts of taxes.On the whole, I do believe that taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in.";The debate surrounding whether families who send their children to private schools should be exempt from paying taxes that support the state education system is a complex issue that brings forward various arguments on both sides. While there are valid points supporting this viewpoint, I ultimately disagree with the notion that these families should be tax-exempt.Firstly, public education is a cornerstone of a democratic society, funded by collective taxation to ensure that all children have access to fundamental educational resources regardless of their economic background. This system is designed to bolster equality, promote social cohesion, and offer opportunities to those who may not have the means to attend private institutions. If families that opt for private schooling were exempt from paying education taxes, it could lead to a significant decrease in funding for public schools, further straining an already underfunded system and widening the gap between socio-economic groups.Moreover, private school families continue to benefit from the societal infrastructure that public education provides. A well-educated populace contributes to the economy, societal well-being, and civic engagement, all of which indirectly support families regardless of their choice in educational institutions. This creates a shared responsibility in fostering an educated society where all children, regardless of their schooling, benefit.However, proponents of tax exemption argue that it is unfair for private school families to contribute to a system they do not utilize. While it may seem reasonable, this perspective overlooks the broader societal consequences and the importance of maintaining robust public education for all. There are alternative solutions, such as voucher programs or scholarships, which can provide more equitable access without compromising the integrity of public education funding.In conclusion, while the choice to send children to private schools is a personal one, it should not exempt families from contributing to the public education system. The benefits of a well-funded and accessible education system extend beyond individual families, positively impacting the community and society as a whole.
395;Government investment in the arts, such as music and theatre, is a waste of money. Governments must invest this money in public services instead. To what extent do you agree with this statement?;There has been wide opinion that Government should invest more money on public services rather than arts such as music and theatre. However, in my perspective, both public services and arts worth investment.It is obvious axiomatic that indispensable public services like hospital and school worth every penny investing. Investing in hospitals helps improve people's health, also, in schools assists with raising our children's education level. Apparently if these facilities were not spent adequately, our standard of living would deteriorate.But our standard of living also depend on another factor - spiritual life which is related closely with arts. Arts include many forms and music as well as cinema are the most typical. These two art forms not only provide the public with entertainment but also contribute significantly to the economy. The income of film and music industries produce millions of dollars each year for the Goverment, for instance K-pop and Hollywood, and these industries can not survive without goverment's financial assistance. The long and the short of it, both arts and public services are important to the community and should be invested properly.;The assertion that government investment in the arts, including music and theatre, is a waste of money when compared to public services such as healthcare and education is a contentious one. While it is undeniable that public services are critical for societal functioning, dismissing the value of the arts overlooks their significant contributions to culture, economy, and social cohesion.Firstly, the arts play a vital role in promoting mental health and well-being. Engaging in artistic activities, whether as a participant or spectator, has been shown to reduce stress, combat depression, and foster community connections. This is particularly pertinent in times of crisis, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic, when arts and entertainment provided solace and a sense of normalcy. Investing in the arts can therefore be viewed not merely as expenditure but as a preventative measure that may reduce long-term costs in healthcare.Secondly, the arts significantly contribute to the economy. Creative industries create jobs, attract tourism, and stimulate local economies. For example, cities renowned for their cultural offerings often experience increased foot traffic and business for local shops and restaurants. A report from the UK government stated that every £1 invested in arts organizations generates approximately £4 in economic returns. This demonstrates that funding the arts can have multifaceted economic benefits that bolster public revenue.Finally, the arts facilitate critical dialogue about societal issues, fostering an informed and engaged citizenry. They provide a platform for marginalized voices and encourage empathy and understanding across different communities. As such, investment in the arts can enhance social cohesion, which in turn strengthens the fabric of society.In conclusion, while investment in public services is paramount, categorizing government spending on the arts as a waste of money fails to recognize their intrinsic value. A balanced approach that includes support for both the arts and public services is essential for cultivating a vibrant, resilient society. Thus, I contend that investment in the arts is not only justified but necessary for holistic societal development.
396;It is inevitable that as technology advances, traditional cultures will be lost. It seems that we cannot have these two things together. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, technology has been developing significantly, impacting many aspects of our life. While there is belief that technology advances means a lost in traditional cultures, I would argue that although the affect of technology on culture is undeniable, it has also contributed to the preservation of traditonal culture.Thanks to modern technology, our life has been improved with many gadgets. The invention of mobile phone and internet has changed our traditional ways of communicating as well as working, it has also been much less labourous than in the pass with the assistance of electrical machineries. However, these newfangled practices has replaced many old traditional ones. For instance, factories equipped with new and highly-productive system has replaced old handmade products, the exchange of letters among friends is so hard to be seen as we have had emails and social network instead, new video games has superseded the old-physical ones. Many old traditionally cultural things have long gone as a result of modern technology.However, despite the drawback mentioned above, technology has also made some contributions to the maintenance and study of traditional cultures in some ways. Internet has aided to assess the young generations to the cultural identity of many nations from all around the world. With the help of advanced methods, many art masterpiece has been well restorated and well preserved. Modern devices also assist the scientists to study the ancient societies much more deeply, hence discovering more cultural traces.To give a brief conclusion, Modern technogy has impacted the traditional cultures in both negative and positive ways.;"The rapid advancement of technology has significantly transformed human society, shaping communication, education, and even daily routines. This transformation raises concerns about the potential loss of traditional cultures, leading to a contentious debate on the compatibility of technological progress with cultural preservation. While it is true that technology can overshadow and dilute traditional practices, I argue that it is not inevitable for cultural loss to occur; rather, technology can serve as a powerful tool for revitalization and preservation of these cultures.One of the primary ways technology threatens traditional cultures is through globalization, where dominant cultures can overshadow local practices. The widespread use of social media and digital platforms often promotes a homogenous set of ideals, aesthetics, and lifestyles, which can marginalize indigenous and traditional cultures. As younger generations adopt global trends, there is a legitimate fear that their ancestral customs, languages, and rituals may be lost to time.However, it is essential to recognize that technology can also play a crucial role in cultural preservation. For instance, digital archives and platforms can help document endangered languages and practices, making them more accessible to future generations. Initiatives like virtual reality experiences and online storytelling allow users to engage with and appreciate different cultures from anywhere in the world, thereby fostering respect and understanding. Moreover, social media can empower marginalized communities to share their stories and traditions, prompting a renaissance of cultural pride and identity.In conclusion, while the advancement of technology presents challenges to traditional cultures, it also offers numerous opportunities for their preservation and revitalization. It is crucial for societies to strike a balance between embracing technological innovation and safeguarding their cultural heritage. By actively leveraging technology, we can promote the coexistence of modernity and tradition, ensuring that cultural diversity thrives in an increasingly interconnected world."
397;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students to study in every subject. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Ê;There is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty. Personally, I do not agree the viewpoint, because many different characters exist between male and female students.On one hand, boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality. Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases. For instance, there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world. Many boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts. Besides, girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter. This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect.Furthermore, it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender, and that does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development. For example, a girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department, but she is unlikely to focus on her subject, and this also can block the girl's future development and career prospect.On the other hand, universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities, and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects. It would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender.In conclusion, it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject.;The debate over whether universities should enforce equal admissions for male and female students across all subjects is a complex issue that encompasses principles of equality, meritocracy, and societal needs. While the aim of achieving gender parity in education is commendable, the approach of mandating equal numbers raises several concerns.On one hand, advocating for equal representation in higher education can help dismantle long-standing stereotypes and biases that have historically marginalized women, especially in fields traditionally dominated by males, such as engineering and computer science. Ensuring equal numbers could create a more balanced educational environment, fostering collaboration and diverse perspectives that enhance learning. Furthermore, given that gender disparities still exist in many fields, an equal admissions policy might help level the playing field, encouraging more women to pursue careers in areas where they have been underrepresented.On the other hand, strictly enforcing equal admissions may undermine the principle of meritocracy. Admissions should primarily be based on a student’s qualifications, aptitude, and passion for the subject, rather than gender. Forcing equal representation in every discipline could lead to situations where less qualified candidates are admitted due to their gender, ultimately diluting the academic rigor and quality of programs. Moreover, the varying levels of interest among genders in certain subjects—exemplified by disparities in applications to engineering versus nursing programs—suggest that imposing quotas may not reflect actual desire or capability.In conclusion, while the pursuit of gender balance in higher education is essential, it is crucial to adopt a nuanced approach. Rather than enforcing strict numerical parity across all subjects, universities should focus on encouraging participation and supporting initiatives that promote gender diversity, thus ensuring that both merit and equality can coexist without compromising educational standards.
398;Many people believe that media coverage of celebrities is having a negative effect on children. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;Celebrities, for example movie stars, are usually seen on media living a luxury life or having a new girlfriend, etc. It is human nature that people, especially youngsters, are attracted to the celebrities they favour, and that is why the media prefer to cover as much news of the celebrities as possible. But I tend to think that this is a worrying tread which has negative impact on children.The first impression of the celebrities seems that they are rich while not having to work hard. This gives children the idea that it is not necessary to study hard at school for a better career and earning a living. Further more, they will not value other people's hard work and take everything for granted.Meanwhile, not all celebrities are role models. It is not uncommon to see on the media that some of them are committing to crimes or misbehaving such as being addicted to drugs or alcohols, having messy sex lives. Worse still, without proper parenting, children may perceive that this is the cool life people are supposed to be living.Of course, some celebrities, e.g. writers, passionate entrepreneurs are good examples to children for they share fascinating stories or how to pursue their goal by doing something that has a meaning to them and may change the world.In conclusion, media should shift its focus from covering celebrities to elsewhere. Meanwhile, children's access to the celebrities news on the media should be restricted and they should study only from the celebrities who can act positively.;The influence of media coverage of celebrities on children is a subject garnering increasing attention in contemporary society. Many argue that the relentless portrayal of celebrity lifestyles can have detrimental effects on young audiences. I largely agree with this opinion, as the ways in which celebrities are represented can shape the values, aspirations, and behaviors of children adversely.Primarily, constant exposure to idealized celebrity images can create unrealistic standards of beauty, success, and lifestyle. Children, who are often impressionable and still developing their identities, may internalize these ideals, believing they need to emulate these figures to be accepted or valued. This can lead to issues such as low self-esteem, body image distortion, and a skewed understanding of success that equates it solely with fame or wealth.Moreover, the content consumed through media—often glamorized or sensationalized—may promote negative behaviors that children might seek to imitate. Examples abound of celebrities engaging in risky activities such as substance abuse, provocative behavior, or displaying materialism. When these acts are celebrated in media, children may perceive them as desirable traits, potentially leading to a normalization of such conduct in their own lives.However, it is essential to acknowledge that not all media coverage is detrimental. Some celebrities use their platforms to advocate for positive social change, engage in philanthropy, and promote beneficial messages. In these instances, children can certainly benefit from these role models. Nevertheless, the pervasive nature of negative portrayal tends to overshadow these positive examples.In conclusion, while celebrity culture offers potential role models to children, the predominance of negative media coverage can significantly erode the values and self-image of young audiences. Hence, it is vital for parents, educators, and society as a whole to critically engage with media consumption and guide children toward more positive representations and messages.
399;"""Prevention is better than cure"". Out of a country's health budget, a large proportion should be diverted from treatment to spending on health education and preventative measures. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?";In today's world, the concept of the welfare state requires governments to provide sustainable healthcare and health education to their citizens. I completely agree with the idea that governments should devote a greater portion of their health budgets to health education and means for precautions.The first reason why education and preventative measures should receive a greater budget is the potential improvements in health system. I believe that decreasing the number of patients in the health system can lead hospitals and healthcare centers to be managed effectively which will result in better treatments for current patients. Therefore, society should be educated and became aware of health issues so that the potential precautions on the way of illnesses can be taken instead of trying to provide treatment for the increasing number of patients.The second reason why governments should allocate more budget on prevention from illness and providing health education is the welfare of the society. In my opinion, there is nothing more important than health in a human's life and the happiness and welfare come with health. Therefore, a government's role should be providing means that lead its citizens to learn how to prevent from potential illness that can cause misery in people's lives. For example, the marketing campaign of Ministry of Health in Turkey which aimed smoking problem among the youth increased the well-being of those who quit smoking and adapted a better lifestyle after the campaign.In conclusion, a greater proportion of the budget should be allotted to education and prevention issues in comparison with treatment due to achieve more effective health system and greater level of well-being.;"The assertion that ""prevention is better than cure"" resonates deeply within the realm of public health. It posits that investing resources in health education and preventative measures can yield superior outcomes compared to treating diseases after they occur. I strongly agree with the view that a significant portion of a country's health budget should be reallocated from treatment to proactive health strategies.To begin with, preventative measures such as vaccination programs, regular health screenings, and public health campaigns significantly reduce the incidence of diseases. These initiatives not only improve overall health outcomes but also alleviate the financial burden on healthcare systems. For instance, immunization against measles or influenza can prevent outbreaks and save millions in treatment costs, while enhancing community wellbeing. By shifting funds towards such preventative strategies, countries can reduce the frequency and severity of health crises, thereby fostering a healthier population.Moreover, health education empowers individuals to make informed choices regarding their lifestyle. By promoting awareness of nutrition, physical activity, and the dangers of smoking or excessive alcohol consumption, we can cultivate a culture of health consciousness that diminishes the risk factors associated with chronic diseases. A well-informed public is better equipped to engage in proactive health behaviors, ultimately leading to a decline in healthcare demands and costs.However, it is crucial to recognize that treatment will always be necessary, as not all diseases can be prevented. Thus, a balanced approach is vital. Funding treatment can be prioritized for acute illnesses and emergency care, but it should not eclipse the importance of preventative measures. A harmonized strategy that emphasizes the value of prevention can result in long-term health care savings and enhance the quality of life for populations.In conclusion, directing a larger portion of health budgets towards health education and preventative measures is not merely a pragmatic approach but a moral imperative. By prioritizing prevention, societies can expect to see healthier populations, reduced healthcare costs, and a more sustainable health system overall."
400;Fatherhood ought to be emphasized as much as motherhood. The idea that women are solely responsible for deciding whether or not to have babies leads on to the idea that they are also responsible for bringing the children up. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's world, having and raising children can be a very difficult task for families, the smallest component of the society. While mother's role is essential in a child's life, I completely agree with the idea that fatherhood is a as vital part of a healty parantage as much as motherhood.The first reason why the father's role should be equal to the mother's role is the nature of parantage. In my view, the role models within a family play a significant role in the development of the child's characteristics. For example, in a traditional Turkish family, while a mother has a sincere and thoughtful approach to the child, a father role must be present as authoritarian and conversative to raise a well-behaved child. The second reason why I believe that fatherood is as important as motherhood is the dynamics of the relationships today. In my opinion, we are living in a society that puts a significant importance to gender equality in every aspect of the life, including relationships. For instance, a family formed by a woman with a housewife role who looks after the home and takes care of children and a man who brings money home can not be seen anymore in today's society. Instead, all of the couple duties are performed equally and interchangeably by individuals. Therefore, I believe that having and raising children should not be different than any other daily activity.In conclusion, fatherhood should be as present as motherhood in a child's life starting from the the birth due to providing appropriate parenthood and having healthy family relationships.;Fatherhood ought to be emphasized as much as motherhood, and recognizing the equal importance of both parents is crucial for a balanced view of family dynamics and child-rearing responsibilities. Historically, societal norms have placed the bulk of parenting and child-rearing responsibilities on mothers, perpetuating the notion that women are solely responsible for decisions surrounding pregnancy and child upbringing. This perspective not only undermines the role of fathers but also reinforces outdated gender stereotypes that can be detrimental to both parents and children.First, it is essential to acknowledge that parenting is a shared responsibility. The involvement of fathers in the decision-making process regarding family planning and child-rearing is vital for nurturing a child's development. Research has shown that children benefit significantly from having engaged fathers who are actively involved in their lives. Positive father-child relationships contribute to emotional stability, social skills, and overall well-being, demonstrating that fatherhood is as critical as motherhood.Moreover, emphasizing fatherhood can help dismantle the stigma surrounding men who wish to take on primary caregiving roles. As societal expectations shift, many fathers are embracing their role as caregivers and actively participating in early childhood development. This evolving dynamic challenges traditional gender roles and supports a more equitable distribution of parenting responsibilities.Additionally, focusing on fatherhood fosters a more inclusive understanding of family structures. Various family models exist today, and recognizing the importance of all caregivers—be they fathers, mothers, or other relatives—ensures that children receive the support they need for healthy growth. In conclusion, to promote a more balanced view of parenting, it is paramount to emphasize fatherhood alongside motherhood. Societal acknowledgment of the significance of both parents in child-rearing is essential not only for children's developmental outcomes but also for fostering a culture that values partnership and shared responsibility in family life.
401;It is important that children should study hard at school. time spent playing sport is time wasted. to what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Some people believe that studying hard is essential part for children, otherwise others people think that playing sport is waste of time. In my point of view, both of studying hard and playing sports are part of life to children. On the other hand, studying hard will give children a better future. Studying hard gives children with a plenty of knowledge and skills for their future. Naturally, children will be growing up and looking for their job. For instance, children who always studying hard and getting high achievement, it will be easy to pass qualification for work and they are more likely to find great work at multinational company. If they working at multinational company as the result is they can earn higher salary. The message is when you always studying harder than others you will get best results.At the same time, playing sports will give good effects on children. There are many popular sports among children such as football, basketball, and volleyball. Also, there are many benefit when children doing sport. Firstly, children who always playing sport like football, they will be active as a person and learn to become team-player. It will be good for children, because indirectly they will learn how to socialize each other as a team. That will make children getting lots of friends, so they can contribute positively to community. Secondly, playing sport makes children getting healthy and become children's well-being. In conclusion, both studying hard at school and playing sports can improve children's future.;The statement that children should focus solely on studying hard at school and that time spent playing sports is time wasted is a contentious one. While academic achievement is undoubtedly important for future opportunities, dismissing the value of sports undermines a holistic approach to child development.Firstly, education plays a critical role in equipping children with essential knowledge and skills. A strong academic foundation is vital for future success in higher education and careers. However, this perspective often overlooks the broader developmental benefits that come from engaging in sports and physical activities. Sports teach children invaluable life skills such as teamwork, discipline, leadership, and resilience. These skills are not always cultivated in traditional classroom settings but are crucial for personal and professional success.Moreover, physical health is an integral component of overall well-being. Regular participation in sports helps combat the rising issue of childhood obesity and instills lifelong habits of physical fitness. Children engaged in sports benefit from improved concentration and cognitive function, which can enhance their academic performance. Numerous studies indicate that students who balance academic efforts with physical activities tend to perform better overall.Additionally, sports provide an essential outlet for stress relief and emotional expression. The pressures of academic life can be overwhelming, and sports offer a necessary break, promoting mental health and emotional stability. In conclusion, while studying hard at school is undeniably crucial, characterizing sports as time wasted fails to acknowledge their significant contributions to a child's development. Balancing academics with physical activity fosters well-rounded individuals, preparing them not only for future careers but for life itself. Hence, rather than viewing sports as a distraction, we should regard them as an essential complement to academic learning.
