1395;Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone’s life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is a negative one. Discuss both views and include your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. You should write at least 250 words.;Many people wonder about . Some people think that it has negative impact in our life. However, positive effect on this world.? Of Course for several reasons: firstly, it motivates the psychological point in everyone, and women in particular. They will run to buy this advertised product especially if it’s from , just to show their beauty to men, which may lead to negative effects of too much sexual attention. Secondly, you can sit comfortably with your family and suddenly the telephone is ringing, but it’s nothing important, it’s just another company to convince you to buy one of their products. It is a real . Lastly, sometimes you do not have the financial ability to buy something, but with these new methods of advertisement, you run to buy it, which affect your budget.On the other hand, there are some good sides to advertising. For instance, it compares the prices of many companies which the consumer. Besides, it really see more products which we unless the TV or Radio advertised them. , it breaks our daily routine and allows us to see new faces and learn the language better with the help of the daily updates they deliver through .In conclusion, as we can see there are many aspects to this . I feel that we gain no benefits at all from advertisement, it plays buy more things that they do not need it at all.;Advertising is a ubiquitous aspect of modern life, and its impact on society is a topic of ongoing debate. While some people believe that advertising has a positive influence, others argue that it has a negative effect. On the one hand, advertising can have a positive impact by motivating people, particularly women, to strive for certain psychological or aesthetic ideals. For instance, beauty product advertisements often feature confident and successful women, which can inspire viewers to work towards similar goals. However, this can also lead to negative effects, such as excessive focus on physical appearance and the objectification of women due to too much sexual attention.On the other hand, some people think that advertising has a negative impact on our lives. For several reasons, this is a valid concern. Firstly, the constant bombardment of advertisements can be intrusive and disruptive. For example, you can be sitting comfortably with your family, and suddenly the telephone is ringing, but it's nothing important, just another company trying to convince you to buy one of their products. This can be frustrating and annoying, especially if you are not interested in the product being advertised. Secondly, advertising can create unrealistic expectations and promote consumerism, leading to financial stress and dissatisfaction. Sometimes, you do not have the financial ability to buy something, but the advertisements make you feel like you need it, creating a sense of inadequacy and encouraging overspending.In my opinion, while advertising can have some positive effects, such as promoting certain ideals and providing information about products, its negative impacts outweigh the benefits. The constant and intrusive nature of advertising, combined with its potential to create unrealistic expectations and promote consumerism, make it a largely negative influence on our lives. Furthermore, the exploitation of psychological vulnerabilities, such as the use of sex appeal, can have damaging effects on individuals and society as a whole. Overall, while advertising is a necessary part of modern business, its negative impacts should not be ignored, and efforts should be made to promote responsible and respectful advertising practices.
845;Boxing is a blood sport which often results in physical injury. It is inappropriate for this sport to exist in the modern age.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;There is debatable issue as to whether boxing, a seemingly bloody sport, should be excluded from the modern society. As far as I am concerned, the attempt to remove boxing from the current age is utterly unjustified.Admittedly, boxing is often associated with various disturbing factors, such as foul language, disregard to rivals, violent punches and inelegant appearance as a result of intense physical contacts. However, such gory scenes may frequently take place in underground boxing games which are barely recognised by the professional community of boxing and by the legal system. Unlike underground boxing, professional boxing upholds moral principles and universal values, for examples, respect to opponents, obedience of rules, etc. Also, professional boxers are protected by safety equipment and judges who may stop the game when witnessing any player suffering serious injuries. Therefore, the health hazards involved in boxing games may not be as severe as the public assumes.Another reason reinforcing my position is that boxing already enjoys considerable popularity around the world and plays an important part in people's entertainment, as exemplified by the successful ticket sales of most boxing games and high audience rating of TV programmes broadcasting boxing matches. Given such popularity of boxing, the removal of this sport may cause widespread dissatisfaction and complaint.To draw a conclusion, the exclusion of boxing is completely groundless and irrational, given the safety protection, sportmanship and popularity as reflected in this sport. I expect in the future, more views could arise to furnish the understanding in this regard.;The notion that boxing is a blood sport that has no place in the modern age is a sentiment that I disagree with. While it is true that boxing is often associated with various disturbing factors, such as foul language, disregard for rivals, violent punches, and inelegant appearances as a result of intense physical contact, it is essential to distinguish between professional and underground boxing. The latter, which is barely recognized by the professional community, is where such gory scenes frequently take place.On the other hand, professional boxing upholds moral principles and universal values that are essential in any sport. For instance, respect for opponents, obedience to rules, and fair play are highly valued and enforced in professional boxing matches. Boxers are expected to conduct themselves with dignity and sportsmanship, both in and out of the ring. The professional community of boxing, including organizations like the World Boxing Council (WBC) and the International Boxing Federation (IBF), have rules and regulations in place to ensure the safety of the boxers and the integrity of the sport.Examples of professional boxers who embody these values, such as Muhammad Ali and Manny Pacquiao, demonstrate that boxing can be a noble and respectful sport. They have shown that it is possible to compete at the highest level while maintaining a strong sense of morality and ethics. Furthermore, professional boxing provides a platform for athletes to develop discipline, hard work, and perseverance, which are valuable life skills that extend beyond the boxing ring.In conclusion, while boxing may have a violent and brutal image, it is unfair to dismiss the sport entirely. Professional boxing operates under a strict code of conduct that promotes respect, fair play, and sportsmanship. By recognizing the distinction between professional and underground boxing, we can appreciate the value and merits of this sport, and acknowledge its place in the modern age.
1429;Boys are most influenced by their fathers and girls are most influenced by their mothers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons to support your opinion.;It is true that nowadays have a great influence children. Some people hold the opinion that the same sex is the major determination of influencing parent, but others . As far as I am concerned, . My arguments for this point are listed below.First of all, a father is the person who have already passed ways his son is passing now, in other words, sons are following their father’s footsteps. , based on experience it is easy for a father to notice his sons’ drawbacks and to influence them.Secondly, it is true that a boy is , a girl is a subtle and fragile one. It is hard for mothers to influence their sons, because it is not likely that can affect a strong one.In conclusion, it seems to me unfair that boys are most influenced by their mothers. Based on at least two points above I strongly agree that children are influenced by a parent of the same gender.;"The statement ""Boys are most influenced by their fathers and girls are most influenced by their mothers"" has sparked a heated debate among people. Some people hold the opinion that the same sex is the major determination of influencing parent, suggesting that boys look up to their fathers as role models and girls emulate their mothers. However, others disagree with this notion, arguing that the influence of parents is not solely determined by their sex.As far as I am concerned, I disagree with the statement. My arguments for this point are listed below. Firstly, a parent's influence on their child is not limited to their sex. Both mothers and fathers can have a profound impact on their children, regardless of their sex. A child's upbringing, personality, and values are shaped by the combined efforts of both parents. Secondly, in many families, the opposite-sex parent can have a more significant influence on a child. For instance, a boy may be closer to his mother, who provides emotional support and nurturing, while a girl may look up to her father, who teaches her about resilience and independence.Moreover, in modern families, the traditional roles of mothers and fathers are evolving. With more fathers taking on caregiving roles and mothers pursuing careers, the influence of parents is becoming more balanced. Children are now exposed to a wider range of role models and influences, making it difficult to pinpoint the influence of one parent over the other based on sex alone. In conclusion, while the statement may hold some truth, it is an oversimplification of the complex relationships within families. The influence of parents on their children is multifaceted and depends on various factors, including their individual personalities, relationships, and family dynamics."
1384;Children should be engaged in paid work, agree or disagree?;"In many countries children are engaged in different kinds of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?The issue of whether or not children should be engaged in some paid work has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that having some employment experience is conducive to a child’s learning and development, I contend that it would bring harm to the child’s and learning.First of all, a workplace designed for adults normally child-friendly facilities. Desks and chairs are too high for a child; the light switches are installed on the walls unreachable children; also emergency training and facilities such as phones are only provided to adults. Furthermore, various hazards such as polluted air and chemical fumes are still produced in factories and farms. Undoubtedly young people would suffer in such workplaces.Also, children would find it frustrating when they are not properly inducted before starting a job. A child working in a cement factory would feel a setback when he could not get immediate support while struggling with the procedures of recording different raw materials that required by the job. Further, without sufficient support, a child’s misunderstanding or inappropriately communicating with adults would only disappoint him and prevents him from active learning and interacting with other people.To conclude, a child’s paid employment experience would lead to a negative impact on their health and active learning. However, recognizing the importance of children’s learning and their awareness of responsibility, it is advisable to encourage them to be involved in some volunteering opportunities where they can meaningfully learn and interact with other people with sufficient care and support in place for such jobs.This is a good essay. There are only a few errors (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections), but otherwise this work seems worthy of Band 7.5 or 8. Remember to always proofread your essay before submitting it. Keep up the good work!";The debate about whether children should be engaged in paid work has sparked intense discussion among individuals with differing opinions. In many countries, children are already participating in various forms of paid work, which has led some to view this practice as completely wrong, while others see it as a valuable work experience essential for learning and taking responsibility. In my opinion, I disagree that children should be engaged in paid work. Engaging children in paid work can be detrimental to their physical, emotional, and educational well-being. Many children are still in their formative years, and their primary focus should be on acquiring education and developing essential life skills. Paid work can distract them from their studies, leading to poor academic performance and a limited future. Moreover, children may be exposed to hazardous working conditions, which can jeopardize their health and safety.On the other hand, some argue that paid work provides children with valuable experience, teaching them responsibility, time management, and financial literacy. However, I believe that these skills can be acquired through other means, such as volunteering, extracurricular activities, or part-time work that does not interfere with their education. Furthermore, children who work may be denied the opportunity to enjoy their childhood, which is a critical period of development and growth.In conclusion, while some may view paid work as a valuable experience for children, I firmly believe that it is not in their best interest. Children should be allowed to focus on their education and development without the burden of paid work. Governments and societies should work together to ensure that children are protected from exploitation and given the opportunity to reach their full potential.
1383;Children these days are suffering from obesity, why and how can it be solved?;Modern children are suffering from the diseases that were once considered to be meant for adults only. Obesity is a major disease prevalent among children. What are its causes and what solutions can be offered?Nowadays, the increasing rate of overweight children and adults is a worldwide health issue. Obesity is a major problem which is increasing day by day in children. There are various reasons behind it. This essay will discuss the causes of obesity and offer some solutions.The first cause of obesity is junk food. It is often seen that mostly children are fond of burgers, pizzas, noodles and . These types of foods are easily available to them in school canteens. Children love to purchase chips, , ice-cream for lunch. Moreover, in this modern era, parents are working and they do not have time to cook at home. Parents often buy dinner for their children instead of preparing food at home. This calorie-rich diet is making children obese. This problem can be solved by teaching children to cook healthy foods for themselves and banning junk foods and fizzy drinks in schools. This diet can be replaced by milk, juice and fruits for lunch.The second cause of obesity is . It is true that the use of computers and television is increasing children. They spend most of their time watching television or playing video games on a computer. This technological advancement has reduced the level of physical activity in this specific age group. This issue can be resolved by encouraging children to do physical exercises. Parents can take their children to park to encourage playing with friends. Furthermore, schools can add sports in their curriculum to maintain physical fitness in their students.To sum up, it is clear that main causes of obesity are unhealthy eating and not enough physical activities. This ailment can be prevented and treated by healthy eating and physical exercises.This is a good essay. There are only a few minor errors that could have been easily prevented by proofreading this essay one last time before submission (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). Overall, this work seems worthy of IELTS Band 8. Keep up the good work!;The modern generation of children is grappling with a plethora of health issues that were once thought to be the exclusive domain of adults. One of the most pressing concerns is the rising prevalence of obesity among children. Obesity, which was previously considered an adult-onset disease, has now become a major health issue affecting children worldwide. The causes of childhood obesity are multifaceted and can be attributed to a combination of factors, including sedentary lifestyles, poor eating habits, and a lack of physical activity.The proliferation of screens, such as televisions, computers, and mobile devices, has led to a significant decrease in physical activity among children. Furthermore, the widespread availability of high-calorie, high-fat, and high-sugar foods has contributed to unhealthy eating habits. Additionally, the decline of outdoor play and the increasing reliance on cars for transportation have also played a role in the rising obesity rates among children.To combat childhood obesity, a comprehensive approach is necessary. Parents, educators, and policymakers must work together to promote healthy lifestyles and provide children with opportunities for physical activity and healthy eating. This can be achieved by incorporating physical education into school curricula, providing access to safe outdoor play areas, and promoting the consumption of nutritious foods. Moreover, parents should set a good example by adopting healthy habits themselves and encouraging their children to engage in sports, dance, or other physical activities. By working collectively, we can help children develop healthy habits and reduce the risk of obesity, ensuring a brighter and healthier future for the next generation. Ultimately, it is our responsibility to empower children with the knowledge and skills necessary to maintain a healthy lifestyle and prevent the onset of obesity and other adult-onset diseases.
425;Computers are now the basis of the modern world. They should therefore be introduced into classrooms, and their programs used for direct teaching purposes. However, dependence on computers in teaching may carry a certain degree of risk to students.Discuss both sides and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Computers are presntly an integral part of the civilized world and are essential to daily living. Some individuals believe that they should be introduced into the classroom and used for teaching purposes while others are of the opinion that dependence on computers in teaching may pose a risk to students.Introducing computers and their programs in educational instuitions for learning purposes is a beneficial thing to students. The world is fast changing and students need to meet up and be at par with others in the world. The globe is becoming a more digital place and computers are the core of that, teaching using computers will open students' minds to new possibilitiies, faster approaches and more advanced ways of solving problems. A recent study showed that 75% of students who were taught using computers are currently more successful than others in their work places.It is understandable that people also think that dependence on computers in teaching may be detrimental to students. The students may become lazy and may not necessarily want to use their brains to calculate or understand things because the computer has already done that for them. Also using computers to learn in the school environment is also just adding to screen time for the learners; they are already being exposed to lots of wrong things at home adding school to it may not neceesarily the best option.Personally, students have a lot to learn using computers but truthfully speaking most of them already have the technological know how when it comes to using computers and if they actually want to learn more about how to use them, they can do so at home using the popular learning sites, it doesnt necessarily have to be introduced into the school learning system.In conclusion,computers are currently the foundation of the modern world and have their advantages and disadvantages, if they are put to the right use at the appropriate place and time, its benefits are beyond measure.";The integration of computers into classrooms has sparked a heated debate about its effectiveness and potential risks. On one hand, introducing computers and their programs in educational institutions for learning purposes is a beneficial thing to students. Computers provide an interactive and engaging way of learning, making complex concepts easier to understand. With the vast amount of educational software available, students can access a wide range of resources that cater to different learning styles. For instance, a recent study showed that 75% of students who were taught using computers are currently more successful than others in their workplaces, demonstrating the positive impact of technology on academic and professional achievement.On the other hand, some argue that dependence on computers in teaching may carry a certain degree of risk to students. Overreliance on technology can lead to a lack of critical thinking and problem-solving skills, as well as decreased attention span. Moreover, excessive screen time can have negative effects on students' physical and mental health. However, I believe that the benefits of using computers in teaching outweigh the risks. Personally, students have a lot to learn using computers, but truthfully speaking, most of them already have the technological know-how. This prior knowledge can be built upon to enhance their learning experience. By incorporating computers into the curriculum, educators can tap into students' existing skills and interests, making learning more enjoyable and effective. Overall, I strongly support the introduction of computers into classrooms, as it has the potential to revolutionize the way students learn and prepare them for success in an increasingly technology-driven world.
1329;Crime rates are likely to decline due to the advancements in technology, which will help prevent and solve crimes in an easier way. Do you agree or disagree?;"Nowadays technology is advancing faster than ever and many fields are benefitting from the opportunities this trend presents. Some think that crime prevention can be one possible application of new technologies, by allowing to deter offenders or solve crimes in a faster and easier way. In my opinion, innovation in crime prevention can be a game-changer that will reduce both the number of crimes committed and the time it takes to catch those responsible for them.Not everyone is optimistic about the prospects of the use of new technologies in crime prevention, and those who subscribe to the more pessimistic view say that advanced technologies can be accessed by criminals, therefore raising the crime rates. Such tools can, indeed, cause more damage if they fall in the wrong hands; however, it would require the offenders to be highly skilled to be able to use the modern technologies. Statistically, many of them tend to have a lower level of education, and for that reason they are likely to stick to the old ways of committing crimes, whereas the minority of highly skilled criminals are unlikely to make a big difference to the crime levels.Law enforcement workforce, on the other hand, has a much better grip on modern technology. Nowadays police officers and detectives undergo special training, take regular skill update courses, and use high-tech equipment. Facial recognition and thermal imaging are just two examples of the important tools that police are already using to find and catch offenders faster. Ordinary citizens can do their part in preventing burglaries by installing sophisticated systems with sensors, CCTV video feed and various alarms to detect and deter thieves. The combined effort will, no doubt, push the crime curve down.To sum up, even though the wonders of technology are available to everyone, it seems to me that they will better assist law enforcement in solving crimes, and law-abiding citizens in protecting themselves and their property, rather than felons. This will tip the balance in favour of reduction in crime rate and make the world a safer place.";The notion that crime rates are likely to decline due to the advancements in technology is a topic of interest among criminologists and law enforcement officials. I agree with this statement, as technology is advancing faster than ever and many fields are benefiting from the opportunities this trend presents. The rapid growth of technological innovations has far-reaching implications, and crime prevention is no exception.Some think that crime prevention can be one possible application of new technologies, by allowing to deter offenders or solve crimes in a faster and easier way. For instance, advanced surveillance systems, as well as artificial intelligence-powered monitoring tools, can help law enforcement agencies to identify and track potential offenders. Moreover, the use of data analytics can provide valuable insights into crime patterns and trends, enabling authorities to allocate resources more effectively.Furthermore, technology can facilitate the solving of crimes by providing investigators with digital evidence and streamlining the process of collecting and analyzing data. Biometric technologies, such as facial recognition and fingerprint analysis, can also aid in the identification of suspects and victims. Additionally, online platforms and social media can be leveraged to disseminate information and engage the public in crime prevention efforts.In conclusion, I firmly believe that the advancements in technology will contribute to a decline in crime rates. As technology continues to evolve, its applications in crime prevention and solution will become even more sophisticated, enabling law enforcement agencies to respond more effectively to criminal activity. Ultimately, the integration of technology in crime prevention will lead to safer communities and a reduction in crime rates, making our society a better place to live.
1417;Dieting can change a person’s life for the better or ruins one’s health completely. What is your opinion?;Almost of the women today want a beautiful figure. That is why we are able to find a diet programme almost everywhere in the country. Most of the women have and gone on a diet before either to or just health problem.A proper diet programme will help you not only to slim down but also to have a eating habits. For instance more vegetables and fruits meat, fried food and carbonated drinks. For a diet programme we shouldn’t food and water. There are some diet programmes from the doctors that help you to have a heart like the “Three day diet” which we can find on the Internet. This programme allows you to eat fruits and also some meat. This way of dieting will help you to avoid some of the health problems in the future like or a heart attack.However some people do not only go on a diet but they avoid eating and hungry for the whole day. All they have is just either water or juices. Also there people who buy special diet programmes over the counter which are not approved by the health department and they are doing so without consulting a doctor first. They do not follow the basic rules of dieting and this will lead them to some serious health problems like of some body parts or, even worse, death.In my opinion there is wrong with going on a diet as long as we follow the correct way of eating and .;The concept of dieting has become a ubiquitous aspect of modern life, with a significant number of individuals striving to achieve their ideal body shape. Almost all women today want a beautiful figure, and this desire has led to a proliferation of diet programs across the country. These programs can be found in every nook and cranny, each promising to help individuals slim down and attain their desired physique.In my opinion, a proper diet program can indeed change a person's life for the better. Not only can it help individuals lose weight and achieve their desired body shape, but it can also instill healthy eating habits. A well-structured diet program encourages the consumption of more vegetables, fruits, and lean meats, while discouraging the intake of fried foods and carbonated drinks. By adopting such habits, individuals can experience a significant improvement in their overall health and wellbeing.Moreover, a proper diet program can have a profound impact on a person's lifestyle, leading to increased energy levels, improved mental clarity, and a reduced risk of chronic diseases. When done correctly, dieting can be a highly effective way to transform one's life, leading to a more confident, energetic, and healthy individual. However, it is essential to approach dieting in a responsible and informed manner, avoiding fad diets and excessive restrictions that can have detrimental effects on one's health. By embracing a balanced and sustainable approach to dieting, individuals can reap the numerous benefits that a healthy diet has to offer, and ultimately achieve a better quality of life.
1409;Dieting can change a person’s life for the better or ruins one’s health completely. What’s your opinion?;Dieting seems to be of our life in this modern society, especially for those who are health conscious. Different people choose different type of dieting methods, trying to achieve what they believe to be good for either their health or physical appearance. In general, most of the people who diet are focusing on controlling their weight.In our urban society, most of the working class not have the opportunity to consume . Their daily meals consist of fast food which contains large amounts of fat and salt. The most significant of this unhealthy lifestyle is the weight gain especially among those middle age working professionals.Therefore, most of these young and energetic people have to control their diet in order to stay in shape either for their appearance or health. The most common and proper method of maintaining one’s weight is eating less oily food, preferably more green vegetables, fruits and alcohol.However, some have resorted to losing weight by taking their diet to the extreme, not eating at all for days. Others will make themselves vomit after each meal. Many others will go for dieting medication and beverages that help them to lose their appetite. These unhealthy will cause internal damage in the long run.In my opinion, dieting for better health is more important than solely for looking attractive. Individuals who wish to control their weight should seek professional if they are unable to reduce their weight after switching over to a healthy diet for a period of time. Losing weight and losing your health at the same time does not benefit any individual.This essay needs some work. The first body paragraph explains the reason people have for dieting, whereas it should explain what are the advantages or the dangers of it. The second body paragraph explains how to diet, whereas it should present arguments for or against dieting. Therefore, the task is only partially covered here.;The concept of dieting has become a staple in modern society, with many individuals adopting various diets to achieve their desired physique or improve their overall health. In my opinion, dieting can be a double-edged sword, capable of changing a person's life for the better or ruining one's health completely. In our urban society, the working class often finds themselves constrained by their busy schedules, leaving them with limited opportunities to consume balanced and nutritious meals. As a result, their daily meals often consist of fast food, which is notoriously high in fat and salt, and low in essential nutrients.This reliance on fast food can lead to a plethora of health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. In this context, dieting for better health is more important than solely for looking attractive. While physical appearance is often a motivating factor for individuals to embark on a diet, the benefits of a well-planned diet extend far beyond aesthetics. A balanced diet can boost energy levels, improve mental clarity, and strengthen the immune system, ultimately leading to a better quality of life.Furthermore, prioritizing health over physical appearance can lead to a more sustainable and maintainable approach to dieting. Rather than adopting fad diets or extreme calorie restriction, individuals should focus on developing healthy eating habits that can be maintained in the long term. By doing so, they can reap the rewards of improved health, increased confidence, and a more positive body image. In conclusion, while dieting can be a complex and nuanced topic, I firmly believe that its primary purpose should be to improve overall health and wellbeing, rather than solely to achieve a certain physical ideal. By adopting this mindset, individuals can set themselves up for a lifetime of healthy habits and improved quality of life.
1323;Discipline is a growing problem in modern schools. Some people think that parents should discipline their own children, while others think it should be the responsibility of the government. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;While some people argue that parents should take sole responsibility for disciplining their children, others take the view that the government should be in charge of such matters. In my opinion, the young generation should be primarily guided by their parents where rules of behavior and moral principles are concerned. However, in some instances government intervention is necessary.On one side of the argument, there are people who hold the opinion that the responsibility of disciplining a child falls squarely on parents’ shoulders, since they are their first educators, and it is their duty to equip their children with good manners and morals even before their first day at school. In addition, every family has a unique understanding of what a suitable form of discipline entails. Therefore, some parents are concerned that any form of punishment meted out at school might be too harsh. To overcome this issue, they believe that parents should be informed by the school of their child’s wrongdoing so that they could decide an appropriate consequence for their behavior at home.Unfortunately, not all parents are objective enough to make the right decisions when it comes to the upbringing of their children. Some may lack information or sound moral background to discipline their children in a meaningful way. Therefore, the state should shoulder some of the responsibility by implementing a strict set of guidelines and policies on how to discipline children at school. I believe that such policies result in children who flourish and are more likely to become productive citizens that actively contribute to a prosperous nation. Also, this would help both parents and teachers understand which punishments are suitable for minor infractions like missing an assignment or major incidents like bullying or skipping school.In conclusion, while both views are commonly held in society, I believe that the government must be actively involved in the policies related to discipline at schools as this would ensure the well-being and successful development of the youth.;The issue of discipline in modern schools has sparked a heated debate about who should be responsible for enforcing discipline in children. Some people argue that parents should take sole responsibility for disciplining their children, as they are the primary caregivers and have the most significant influence on their child's behavior. This perspective is based on the idea that parents know their children best and are better equipped to teach them right from wrong.On the other hand, others take the view that the government should be in charge of such matters. They believe that the government has a role to play in ensuring that children are taught discipline and moral principles, particularly in cases where parents may be absent or neglectful. According to this perspective, the government can provide a more structured and standardized approach to discipline, which can be beneficial for children's development.In my opinion, the young generation should be primarily guided by their parents where rules of behavior and moral principles are concerned. Parents have a unique opportunity to shape their child's values and behavior from a young age, and their influence can have a lasting impact on their child's life. However, in some instances government intervention is necessary. For example, in cases of child abuse or neglect, government agencies may need to step in to ensure the child's safety and well-being. Additionally, government initiatives can provide support and resources to parents who may be struggling to discipline their children effectively. Ultimately, a combination of parental guidance and government support is necessary to ensure that children develop into responsible and well-disciplined individuals.
1066;Eating sweet foods produces acid in the mouth, which can cause tooth decay. (High acid levels are measured by low pH values)Describe the information below and discuss the implications for dental health.;The given graph shows the level of acidity in the mouth from consuming food that contains fruit or cane sugar and honey.To start with, if we take a look at honey-consistent food, we will notice that the acid level increases within the first 5 minutes. After that, the level of acidity remains at the rate of less than 5 pH, and, then goes down to a normal level. So, it is unlikely tooth decay to occur within such a short period of time.Regarding fruit and cane sugar-consistent food, it is quite noticeable that the acidity level increases dramatically at a level of less than 5.5 pH and 4.5 pH, respectively. However, the main difference between fruit and cane sugar is that the acid level of fruit sugar decreases within a bit more than 15 minutes. In contrast to it, the acid level of cane sugar goes down to a normal level within more than 25 minutes, which is more likely to get tooth decay.;The consumption of sweet foods, particularly those containing fruit or cane sugar and honey, has significant implications for dental health. A graph illustrating the level of acidity in the mouth after consuming these foods reveals a startling trend. The acidity level, measured by pH values, is observed to increase dramatically when consuming foods with fruit or cane sugar and honey. Notably, the acidity level spikes at a pH of less than 5.5 and 4.5, respectively.This increase in acidity is a cause for concern, as high acid levels can lead to tooth decay. The pH scale measures how acidic or basic a solution is, with lower pH values indicating higher acidity. A healthy mouth typically has a pH range of around 6.2-7.6. When the pH level drops below 5.5, the mouth becomes increasingly acidic, creating an environment conducive to tooth decay. The rapid increase in acidity at pH levels of less than 5.5 and 4.5, as seen in the graph, suggests that consuming foods with high sugar content can quickly lead to an acidic environment in the mouth.The implications of this information for dental health are clear. Consuming foods high in sugar, such as those containing fruit or cane sugar and honey, can lead to a rapid increase in acidity in the mouth, thereby increasing the risk of tooth decay. To maintain good dental health, it is essential to limit the consumption of sweet foods and practice good oral hygiene, including regular brushing and flossing. Furthermore, individuals should be mindful of the pH levels of the foods they consume and strive to maintain a balanced diet to minimize the risk of tooth decay. By being aware of the acidity levels of common foods and taking steps to mitigate their effects, individuals can protect their dental health and prevent the damaging effects of tooth decay.

Many companies have transferred their factories into cheaper production to in the world . The results are rising unemployment rates in the “old industrial countries”.In regard to the other countries on the world market, such as China, this job transfer is a big opportunity. But no one can that the consequences for the less developed countries where economy flourished, based on availability of cheap employees are highly important: globalization based on this facts brings problems.Nevertheless, there are also . In general it is remarkable that there is a new tendency in “Thinking Global”. For instance, people are willing to more languages and get educated about cultures. Countries as undeveloped, such as India, are getting chances to be the in a certain field.All in all it can be said that the effects of globalization are enormous. The of economic processes has changed completely. It is important to think in bigger terms, not just about the country. The positive things that this globalization process have brought us for the negative sides. The should be a world in balance, but this has yet to come.;The concept of globalization has been a dominant force in shaping the world's economics, bringing about numerous benefits and opportunities for growth. However, it is essential to recognize that everything in the world has multiple sides, and globalization is no exception. The effects of globalization on the world economy are multifaceted, with both positive and negative consequences.On the one hand, globalization has facilitated international trade, investment, and economic cooperation, leading to increased economic growth, job creation, and improved living standards in many countries. It has also enabled the transfer of technology, knowledge, and ideas, fostering innovation and competitiveness. Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that the negative effects of globalization are of a different kind than the positive ones, often affecting vulnerable populations and less developed countries disproportionately.The negative sides of globalization, such as low wages, poor working conditions, and limited social protections in less developed countries, are important to acknowledge and address. These issues can lead to exploitation, inequality, and social unrest, ultimately undermining the potential benefits of globalization. Furthermore, the increased competition and market pressures resulting from globalization can also lead to the decline of local industries and cultural homogenization, threatening the unique characteristics and traditions of communities.In conclusion, while globalization has undoubtedly had a positive impact on the world economy, its negative sides should not be forgotten. It is crucial to recognize and mitigate the adverse effects of globalization, particularly in less developed countries, to ensure that the benefits of economic integration are shared equitably and sustainably. By acknowledging and addressing these concerns, we can work towards a more inclusive and balanced globalization that promotes prosperity and well-being for all.
1319;Even though experts believe that walking is a great way to improve one’s health, very few people walk nowadays. Why aren’t people walking? What can be done to encourage them to walk more?;The benefits of walking are numerous, and experts recommend it as a good way to keep healthy and fit. Despite this, the number of people who walk on a daily basis is on the decline. The reasons for this are manifold, but there are also several solutions that may help people walk more.Lack of time is the most common reason people cite for not engaging in any form of physical activity. These days most people have hectic schedules that involve juggling their work and home responsibilities. As a result, they are often too exhausted or pressed for time and therefore opt for faster and more comfortable forms of transport, such as cars, bikes or public transport. Another major reason for the reduced number of pedestrians on the roads is a lack of safety. Most full-time workers are not free to walk during the day, and will skip it in the evenings or early morning hours, if they do not feel safe enough to do so.Fortunately, there are quite a few solutions to this issue. One is making walkers safe, which means the government should ensure that there are enough sidewalks and streetlights available in every suburb, so that pedestrians can walk or jog safely whenever time allows. Another useful option is to create special walking tracks and parks in neighbourhoods where people can get some much-needed exercise in the evenings. The added benefit of promoting the healthy lifestyle and walking in the community makes this solution even more attractive.To conclude, the pressures of daily life and lack of safely while walking reduce the popularity of this healthy practice. Governments can reverse this trend by creating more green spaces for people to walk in and addressing their safety concerns.;Despite the numerous health benefits associated with walking, it is alarming to note that very few people engage in this activity nowadays. Experts believe that walking is a great way to improve one's health, but unfortunately, it has become a rarity in today's society. So, what are the reasons behind this trend? According to various studies, lack of time is the most common reason people cite for not engaging in any form of physical activity, including walking. With increasingly busy schedules and demanding lifestyles, people find it challenging to allocate time for walking.Another major reason for the reduced number of pedestrians on the roads is lack of safety. Many cities and towns lack pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, making it difficult and dangerous for people to walk. The absence of sidewalks, crosswalks, and traffic calming measures deters people from walking, especially in areas with high volumes of traffic. As a result, people opt for alternative modes of transportation, such as driving or taking public transport, which are often quicker and perceived as safer.However, governments can play a crucial role in reversing this trend. By creating more green spaces, such as parks and pedestrianized zones, people can be encouraged to walk more. These spaces can provide a safe and enjoyable environment for people to walk, jog, or simply stroll. Moreover, governments can also invest in improving road infrastructure, such as building sidewalks and bike lanes, to make walking a more attractive and viable option. By taking these measures, governments can promote a culture of walking and encourage people to incorporate physical activity into their daily routines. Ultimately, by making walking a more accessible and enjoyable activity, we can improve public health and create more livable and sustainable communities.
1410;Even though globalization affects the world’s economy in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. Discuss.;Everything has two sides and the globalization is not exception. Our first thoughts about this topic include the process of global “McDonaldisation” and, generally speaking, spreading across the whole Globe.Firstly, I would try to concentrate on the positive aspects of globalisation. As far as economy is concerned, like the Global Bank or IMF are always focused on developing the ‘Third World’ and helping poor people to combat their life obstacles (through loans and donations). Moreover, the world becomes an area of sharing thoughts (e.g. philosophical or economical doctrines), which become popular due to lack of barriers.However, disadvantages of globalization are also widely known. Some people insist that because of this process, the spirit of countries and nations rapidly disappears. The integrity, established years ago is on the verge of collapsing. Furthermore, there’s a strong lobby of communists who , that the globalization indicates an uncontrolled reign of capitalists and slave work of lower labour-class. We should never forget about the detrimental impact of global investments on the environment – the green house effect or soar rains are triggered by globalization.To sum up, globalization has both positive and negative influence on our everyday life. I can’t agree with the popular statement that we should try to avoid being affected by it. However, we must not forget about our surroundings and local communities. They have a great value which should last forever.;The phenomenon of globalization has been a subject of debate among scholars and economists, with some hailing it as a panacea for the world's economic woes, while others lament its negative consequences. On one hand, globalization has had a profoundly positive impact on the world's economy, fostering unprecedented levels of economic growth, trade, and cultural exchange. It has created new opportunities for businesses to expand into new markets, and for individuals to access a wider range of goods and services.However, it is equally important to acknowledge the negative side of globalization, which should not be forgotten in our enthusiasm for its benefits. The increased competition and exploitation of cheap labor in developing countries have led to the erosion of workers' rights and the exacerbation of income inequality. Moreover, the homogenization of cultures and the dominance of multinational corporations have threatened the diversity and uniqueness of local economies and traditions.In light of these complexities, I strongly disagree with the popular statement that we should try to avoid being affected by globalization. Rather, than attempting to resist the inevitable, we should strive to understand and navigate the challenges and opportunities presented by globalization. By doing so, we can harness its positive influence to improve our everyday lives, while mitigating its negative consequences. Globalization is an inherent part of our modern world, and its influence on our daily lives is multifaceted. It has both positive and negative effects, and it is our responsibility to be aware of these and make informed choices. Ultimately, by embracing the realities of globalization and working to address its negative aspects, we can create a more equitable and sustainable world for all.
1306;Every household should have a government-imposed limit on the amount of rubbish it can throw away. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"The amount of waste people produce can be quite shocking, with every person generating kilograms of rubbish in a single day, and all this can be difficult to manage. This has given some people the idea that there should be a limitation on the amount of rubbish produced per household; however, opinions are divided as to whether this would be the the most effective option.Having a limitation on the amount of waste produced sounds like a fine solution to a significant problem, with over two hundred and fifty million tons being generated in 2016 by the U.S. alone. Taxing households that break limits would push people to produce less waste and make them more mindful of what can be recycled or composted. However, forcing people to produce less waste might not be attainable.Households produce as much waste as they need to live their lifestyles. The waste people generate is only a result of the products they purchase, and will most likely wish to continue to purchase. Taxing people may be a cause of resentment, with many of them already struggling to pay their usual bills. In addition, if people produce more than they are allowed, this will encourage littering and dumping, so that they are not caught with more waste than entitled, and this in turn will damage the environment.Though controlling the amount of waste produced is important, there could be other ways of encouraging lesser output. In my opinion, governments should encourage composting and recycling, which will also reduce wasted material. People should also be more aware of what waste they produce and how it can be reduced. An education drive on these issues would perhaps be more likely to succeed in reducing rubbish than imposing limitations.";The issue of waste management has become a pressing concern in recent years, with the amount of waste people produce being quite shocking. On average, every person generates several kilograms of rubbish in a single day, contributing to the staggering amounts of waste that end up in landfills and oceans. In an effort to mitigate this problem, some people have suggested that there should be a limitation on the amount of waste produced per household, imposed by the government. While this idea may seem appealing, opinions are divided as to whether this would be the most effective option.On the one hand, imposing a limit on household waste could lead to a significant reduction in the overall amount of waste generated. By setting a cap on the amount of rubbish that can be thrown away, households would be incentivized to reduce, reuse, and recycle more. This, in turn, could lead to a decrease in the environmental harm caused by waste disposal, such as pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, countries like Japan and Sweden have implemented successful waste management systems that emphasize reduction and recycling, resulting in significantly lower waste generation rates.On the other hand, imposing a government limit on household waste could be impractical and potentially unfair. Different households have varying needs and circumstances, and a one-size-fits-all approach may not be effective. For example, a large family with multiple children may generate more waste than a single-person household, simply due to their larger size. Moreover, such a policy could lead to unintended consequences, such as increased costs for households that exceed the limit, or even illegal dumping. Therefore, while the idea of limiting household waste is commendable, it is crucial to consider the complexities and potential drawbacks of such a policy before implementing it.
1406;Every year an increasing number of students choose to go to another country for their higher education. Do you think the benefits of this development outweigh the problems associated with it?;The past twenty years have seen a dramatic change the number of students who go abroad . In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of this trend.On the one hand, both students and their country can benefit from this trend. First, students can choose more suitable methods for themselves because there are more options. The and teaching methods are quite different . According to foreign experts, Secondly, people can improve their foreign language, they can contact with when they are in a foreign country, and they quickly master the foreign language. Thirdly, it helps to promote the mutual understanding between their mother land and their destination countries. These students exchange information with the locals. Students can get better understanding of the countries. People in their home country will get more vivid information about other countries . Similarly, the locals also can get more clear recognition about other countries.On the other hand, there are disadvantages too. Firstly, it costs people a lot of money to begin college in foreign countries. Many families have to take out all their savings to support their children abroad. Secondly, some students cannot stand the big difference the new environment, they quit their study and come back home.To conclude, given the fact that in foreign countries helps students with their studies and promotes the mutual understanding countries, even if there are some drawbacks, I think the benefits outweigh the problems.;The past twenty years have seen a dramatic change in the number of students who go abroad for their higher education. Every year, an increasing number of students choose to leave their home country to pursue academic opportunities in foreign lands. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of this trend, and examine whether the benefits outweigh the problems associated with it.Firstly, it costs people a lot of money to begin college in foreign countries. The tuition fees, living expenses, and travel costs can be prohibitively expensive, making it a significant financial burden for many students and their families. This can lead to a substantial amount of debt, which can be a source of stress and anxiety for students. Moreover, adapting to a new culture, language, and education system can also be a challenging and overwhelming experience for many students.However, despite these challenges, I believe that the benefits of studying abroad far outweigh the problems. Studying in a foreign country provides students with a unique opportunity to experience different cultures, meet people from diverse backgrounds, and gain a global perspective. It also enhances their career prospects, as employers increasingly value international experience and language skills. Furthermore, studying abroad fosters independence, self-reliance, and adaptability, essential skills for success in today's globalized world. Overall, while there are significant costs associated with studying abroad, I firmly believe that the benefits of this trend make it a worthwhile investment for students seeking to broaden their horizons and enhance their future prospects.
1305;Everybody today should pay a small amount from their income in order to help people who are homeless and / or suffering great poverty. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Homelessness and poverty is a terrible but topical issue in both more economically advanced and less industrialised countries. To deal with this, many people feel that a small proportion of everyone’s income should be used to aid the homeless and poor. This could create more opportunities and change the lives of many disadvantaged people for the better.Though there are certain facilities such as shelters and soup kitchens to aid the poor and homeless, it is clear that this is not enough. In the U.S. alone, a very developed country in itself, nearly two million people are homeless. These facilities can lend a helpful hand; however, they do not help eradicate the problem. Those people who are homeless or poor can have trouble finding jobs, or, if they are lucky to gain employment, the pay may not be enough to support them and their families.If a small percentage of everyone’s income was used to help build more aid facilities and fund organisations to help the homeless and poor, the suffering of many people could be alleviated. However, this is not a perfect world, and taxes are high enough for many people. A similar argument could be that a portion of the taxes already paid to the government should then be set aside for this cause, but of course government funds are usually stretched to breaking point as it is, as governments have so many financial responsibilities already.Though the fundamental idea that people should pay a small percentage of their income to help the homeless and poor is admirable, it is unlikely that enough people would agree to it. People need all the money they earn after taxes anyway and, although governments already have too many calls on their available funds, in my view they should prioritise support payments for the homeless.";The notion that everybody should contribute a small portion of their income to support individuals who are homeless and/or suffering from extreme poverty has sparked a heated debate. Many people feel that a small proportion of everyone's income should be used to aid the homeless and poor. This approach could potentially create more opportunities and change the lives of many disadvantaged people for the better. By allocating a minimal amount of their income, individuals can collectively make a significant difference in the lives of those struggling to make ends meet.For instance, this funding could be utilized to establish shelters, provide food and clothing, and offer job training programs to help people get back on their feet. Moreover, this could also have a positive impact on the community as a whole, as it would lead to a reduction in poverty-related crimes and improve overall living conditions. However, this is not a perfect world, and taxes are high enough for many people. Some individuals may argue that they are already burdened with excessive taxes and cannot afford to contribute even a small amount to this cause.Furthermore, there are also concerns that the funds collected may not be utilized effectively, and could potentially be mismanaged or wasted. Therefore, while the idea of contributing to support the homeless and poor is noble, it is crucial to consider the practical implications and potential drawbacks. Perhaps, an alternative approach could be to encourage voluntary donations, rather than mandatory contributions, allowing individuals to choose whether or not to support this cause. Ultimately, the decision to contribute to support the homeless and poor should be a personal choice, rather than a compulsory obligation.
1407;Financial education should be a mandatory component of the school program. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;In many countries the discussion about financial education getting more serious due to financial problems of young generation. Some people that financial education should be considered a mandatory subject at school.The common problem for those young people is that they don’t know how to spend money in right way. As we can see many advertisements often carry out the message, “Only 10 dollars a week, no deposits” which is misleading think that living in debt is normal. Financial education is one of the solutions for . The basic idea of financial education as a core school subject is to teach those young ones to understand the concept of using money and to estimate a risk of borrowing money to buy something in the future.However, another factor we need . In my opinion, the role of financial education is getting more important and it should be a part of the school program but the parents are also important and have responsibility to how to manage the money. More than 70% of young people’s money is from their parents. In addition, it has to be considered that a student might become person, talking about money all the time in class or even in a public place. It can be harmful for some students and affect their normal social life.In conclusion, I that financial education will have a positive effect on all young ones and other such social commutations should be considered just as important as financial education.;The statement that financial education should be a mandatory component of the school program has garnered significant attention in recent years. In many countries, the discussion about incorporating financial education into school curricula has become increasingly serious, particularly in light of the financial problems faced by the young generation. The rising levels of student debt, poor financial literacy, and lack of basic money management skills among young people underscore the need for financial education.In my opinion, the role of financial education is becoming more important, and it should indeed be a part of the school program. By teaching financial literacy in schools, students can gain a solid understanding of personal finance, budgeting, saving, and investing, which are essential life skills. This knowledge will empower them to make informed decisions about their financial lives, avoid debt traps, and build a secure financial future. Moreover, financial education can also promote a culture of responsible financial behavior, contributing to the overall economic stability of society.However, while making financial education a part of the school program is crucial, it is equally important to acknowledge the role of parents in reinforcing these lessons. Parents are the primary influencers of their children's financial habits and attitudes towards money. Therefore, it is essential that parents are also educated and involved in the process, so they can support and extend the learning initiated at school. This collaborative approach between schools and families will ensure that young people receive a comprehensive and consistent financial education, equipping them with the skills necessary to navigate the complexities of the financial world effectively. Ultimately, combining school-based financial education with parental guidance will be the most effective strategy in fostering financial literacy and responsibility among the young generation.
1404;Full time university students spend most of the time studying. They should be doing other activities too. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Full time study in university is a great experience in life but in parallel to that students other activities such as working for their pocket money, sports, participating in debates and . People differ in their opinion if students must in other things or stay concentrated on their studies only. The discussion will be presented below, followed by my opinion.Some people say that mere studying does not youth for a country. This way, students only earn theoretical knowledge not practical. For instance, students can be their studies but at the same time when they , they fail and cannot develop their confidence and work as brilliantly as they were in university. Hence, the best approach for them to be engaged here and there for practical experience.On the other hand, others believe that building a better career is the foremost thing in today’s world. So, they are targeted to their studies and gain as much knowledge as they can. Furthermore, if they are diverted from their studies, they will not be able to their .In my point of view, there must be blending of full time education and extra activities. It refreshes students’ minds and provides more energy . Moreover, by this way, they will learn how to with other people in the society.To summarize, it can be said that it is important to concentrate on but on the other hand there must be something to keep active and relaxed being involved in games, music, work and other extra activities.;Full-time university study is a great experience in life, providing students with a wealth of knowledge and opportunities for personal growth. However, the question remains as to whether students should focus solely on their studies or engage in other activities as well. In my opinion, I agree that full-time university students should balance their academic commitments with other activities.On one hand, devoting all their time to studying can lead to academic success, but it can also result in a narrow and limited university experience. On the other hand, participating in other activities such as working part-time to earn pocket money, engaging in debates, and joining clubs or societies can enrich a student's life and provide them with valuable skills and experiences. For instance, working part-time can teach students the importance of time management, budgeting, and responsibility, while participating in debates can improve their public speaking, critical thinking, and teamwork skills.People differ in their opinion on this matter, some believe that students should concentrate solely on their studies, while others think that engaging in other activities is essential for personal growth and development. I believe that a balanced approach is the most beneficial, where students can allocate time for studying, while also pursuing other interests and activities. This approach can help students develop into well-rounded individuals, equipped with a range of skills, knowledge, and experiences that will benefit them in their future careers and personal lives. In conclusion, while full-time university study is a significant commitment, I strongly believe that students should also engage in other activities to enhance their university experience and broaden their horizons.
1293;Having a salaried job is better than being self-employed. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;If one wants to work for money, there are really only two options, working for someone else for a salary and being self-employed. Most people are involved with these two options and they both have advantages and disadvantages.Being self-employed means that the worker owns the business that is being done. This might be a small one-person business or a large company with hundreds of employees. The first advantage of this is the capacity to earn more money. If the business does very well, the income can be considerable and the owner of the company will receive the benefits. On the other hand, if business is not good, the owner’s income will be low. Self-employed people also have the benefit to some extent of choosing their working hours and holidays and they have the right to change anything within their business. With this autonomy, however, comes the pressure to succeed and the reliance on one’s employees, if there are any, to do their best to make the business thrive.Salaried workers do not experience the same stress as the self-employed owners of companies. They might have stress in their duties, but the pressure that comes with keeping one’s own business operating successfully in order to support oneself and one’s family is just not felt by an employee. The employee also has a certain knowledge of his or her income, as the salary is usually fixed every month. The self-employed owner’s income often depends on how successful the business is. The employee’s fixed income, however, does not give much scope for earning large amounts more. In addition, an employee does not have the freedoms of the owner or the autonomy, and for many people, having control over their lives is a significant factor to their well-being.It is certain that there are advantages and disadvantages for both being self-employed and salaried. I personally disagree that being salaried is better than being self-employed. I prefer the autonomy that being self-employed brings and, although there is more risk and pressure, this can lead to greater and more fulfilling rewards.;The debate about whether having a salaried job is better than being self-employed has been ongoing for years. In my opinion, the statement that having a salaried job is better than being self-employed is not entirely true. If one wants to work for money, there are really only two options: working for someone else for a salary and being self-employed. Both options have advantages and disadvantages that need to be considered.On the one hand, having a salaried job provides a sense of security and stability, with a fixed income and benefits such as health insurance and retirement plans. This can be attractive to individuals who value predictability and want to avoid financial risks. However, the income is generally fixed, and there is limited potential for significant financial growth.On the other hand, being self-employed offers the potential for unlimited financial growth. If the business does very well, the income can be considerable, and the owner will receive the benefits. With this autonomy, however, comes the pressure to succeed. Self-employed individuals must be prepared to take on all the risks and responsibilities associated with running a business, including financial instability and long working hours. Nevertheless, many people find the freedom and flexibility of being their own boss to be incredibly rewarding.In conclusion, whether having a salaried job is better than being self-employed depends on individual priorities and circumstances. While salaried jobs offer stability and security, being self-employed provides the potential for significant financial rewards and autonomy. Ultimately, both options have their advantages and disadvantages, and the best choice for an individual will depend on their personal values, skills, and goals.
1339;High-rise vs. low-rise buildings, which solution is better for a growing population?;Some cities create new housing for their growing populations by constructing a smaller number of high-rise buildings. Other cities create more of low-rise buildings. Which solution is better, in your opinion?Sample EssayRising population in urban areas leaves governments with no choice but to build more houses to meet the demand. However, when it comes to construction, there is more than one way to build new homes. Some cities prefer to construct fewer residential towers, while others build a larger number of low-rises for their residents. In this essay both options will be discussed and a viable solution will be suggested.One advantage of tall buildings is that they can accommodate a large number of people while having a small footprint. This type of construction is popular in central city areas where land is scarce and expensive. For example, in New York City high-rise buildings have significantly reduced housing problems, by as much as 55% in the last few years. As a result of this strategy, rents tend to decrease which has a further positive impact on the economies of such cities. However, tall buildings offer little or no privacy, they force certain rules and regulations upon residents, and attract higher maintenance costs.Given a chance to voice their opinion, many individuals would prefer to live in low-rise buildings or even build their own houses. This option might be more attractive for big families and for older generation people who like to have their own personal space. Accessibility is also a concern for the elderly as taking the stairs when the lifts break down may not be an option for them. In addition, one or two-story houses are easier and cheaper to maintain compared to modern apartment towers. The downside of this type of dwellings is that they occupy much more land, and since land is cheaper on city fringes, new estates tend to be built away from city centres. This increases commute time to work for their residents and negatively affects their quality of life.In conclusion, high-rise and low-rise buildings have their unique advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, high rises are more suitable for younger residents and should be built in the areas where young population is prevalent, closer to the city centre and employment opportunities. Senior citizens should have a supply of lower dwellings available in quieter locations. Such flexible approach can be a good way to address the needs of growing city’s population.;As the global population continues to grow, cities are faced with the challenge of providing adequate housing for their increasing residents. Two common approaches to addressing this issue are constructing high-rise buildings and low-rise buildings. While both solutions have their advantages and disadvantages, the better approach, in my opinion, depends on various factors.On one hand, high-rise buildings offer a space-efficient solution, allowing for a large number of residents to be accommodated in a relatively small area. This approach is often favored in densely populated cities where land is scarce. For instance, cities like Hong Kong and Singapore have successfully implemented high-rise developments, providing housing for thousands of people while minimizing the impact on the surrounding environment. However, high-rise buildings can also lead to increased congestion, higher construction costs, and potential issues with accessibility and community cohesion.On the other hand, low-rise buildings, such as single-family homes or small apartment complexes, offer a more traditional and community-oriented approach to housing. This solution is often preferred in suburban or rural areas where space is more abundant. Low-rise buildings can provide a greater sense of community and connection to the surrounding environment, as well as easier access to outdoor spaces and natural light. Nevertheless, low-rise developments can result in urban sprawl, leading to increased transportation costs, higher infrastructure expenses, and potential environmental degradation.In my opinion, a balanced approach that combines elements of both high-rise and low-rise buildings is the most effective solution. By incorporating high-rise developments in densely populated areas and low-rise buildings in outer suburbs, cities can create a more sustainable, equitable, and community-oriented housing strategy. Ultimately, the choice between high-rise and low-rise buildings depends on the specific needs and context of each city, and a nuanced approach that considers factors such as population density, land availability, and community preferences is essential for creating thriving and livable urban environments.
1365;IELTS Essay, topic: Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between the rich and poor, while others disagree (discuss);Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between rich and poor people, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.There is no doubt that modern technology is reshaping our planet and affecting every aspect of human lives. From a social perspective, many people argue that the gap between the upper class and lower classes is widening as a result of technological advancements. Others, however, believe the opposite.There are several reasons why one could think that the wealth inequality is, indeed, increasing. The most common reason is automation. Driven by technology, automation reduces the need for manual labour. As a result, less work opportunities are available for unskilled people. With each iteration of the cycle the competition increases and wages decrease. , technology has increased the minimum level of needs that should be satisfied. Nowadays, everybody should have a mobile phone and an internet connection, including the poor. This increases the monetary burden on them as they must borrow to cover these new needs.However, I firmly believe that the aforementioned opinion is ludicrous. The most obvious reason is that modern technology has facilitated the road to riches in an unprecedented manner. For instance, many of the internet billionaires are from lower and middle classes. Moreover, the major leaps in agricultural technologies magnified food production. As a result, food has become more affordable and available. Finally, leveraging technology has dramatically increased workers’ productivity. Consequently, compensations and salaries have increased.In conclusion, I strongly believe that technology could possibly narrow the difference between social classes. Increased food production, opportunities and productivity are just few examples of technology’s contribution to bridging the wealth gap.This essay adequately covers all parts of the task. The ideas expressed in this written response are relevant, well-developed, ordered in a logical way and supported. The paragraphing is suitable and cohesion is maintained throughout the essay. A good range of vocabulary and the writer’s fluency are evident. There are no spelling errors and very few mistakes in word choice and grammar, most sentences are error-free. The essay is likely to get Band 8 in IELTS.;The advent of modern technology has sparked a heated debate about its impact on societal inequality. Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between the rich and poor, while others disagree. In this essay, I will discuss both views and provide my own opinion.On the one hand, those who argue that modern technology is widening the gap between the rich and poor point out that it has created new opportunities for wealth accumulation, primarily benefiting those who are already affluent. For instance, the rise of e-commerce and digital platforms has enabled entrepreneurs and business owners to expand their markets and increase their profits, thereby widening the wealth gap. Furthermore, the cost of adopting new technologies, such as high-speed computers and sophisticated software, can be prohibitively expensive for low-income individuals, limiting their access to information and job opportunities.On the other hand, others argue that modern technology has the potential to bridge the gap between the rich and poor. They contend that technology has made it possible for people to access information, education, and job opportunities that were previously unavailable to them. For example, online courses and educational resources have democratized access to knowledge, enabling people from all walks of life to acquire new skills and improve their socio-economic status. Additionally, technology has also created new job opportunities in fields such as software development, data analysis, and digital marketing, which can be pursued by people from diverse backgrounds.In my opinion, while modern technology has the potential to exacerbate existing inequalities, it also offers numerous opportunities for social mobility and economic empowerment. Ultimately, the impact of technology on the gap between the rich and poor depends on how it is utilized and distributed. Governments, organizations, and individuals must work together to ensure that the benefits of technology are shared equitably and that everyone has access to the tools and resources they need to thrive in the digital age. By doing so, we can harness the power of technology to create a more inclusive and equitable society.
1388;In many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?;Nowadays, many children involved in different types of jobs to have some kind of financial assurance for themselves. However, whether this is good for their development and personality is a controversial issue. I personally believe that paid works is harmful for children for several reasons.It is said that children gain valuable experience in the work place. This may be true. However, I would argue that children are mainly employed in jobs that require manual work and are poorly paid. The recent statistics reveal the common tasks that children are assigned to are washing dishes, mopping floors or serving food in restaurants. Meanwhile, this kind of jobs actually provide children with necessary and useful skills to apply in their future .This brings me to the second point. Defenders of child labour that it is an effective method of learning. The point is children should be able to apply knowledge taught to them in a real life working environment. Although this is undoubtedly true, it also means that children may neglect the classroom study and even fail the class. The worst thing is yet to come. They may become so preoccupied with the benefits ahead of them such as small salary that they may leave school.Finally, supporters say that it helps them to build responsibility in the family. They will understand how it is difficult to earn money and therefore have compassion for their parents. This is true to a certain extent, but may have a totally adverse effect on children. As children can make money at an early age, they would feel that it is appropriate to spend it on luxury things.In conclusion, I think that parents should take measures to restrict their child from work, otherwise it would have negative consequences to their future.;The engagement of children in paid work is a widespread phenomenon in many countries, with numerous young individuals involved in various types of jobs to have some kind of financial assurance for themselves. However, whether this is good for their development and personality is a controversial issue. On one hand, some people argue that paid work provides children with valuable work experience, teaching them important life skills such as responsibility, time management, and financial literacy. This experience can be beneficial in shaping their future careers and helping them become self-sufficient individuals.On the other hand, many consider child labor to be completely wrong, as it can hinder their educational and personal development. Children who work may be forced to sacrifice their childhood, miss out on education, and be exposed to hazardous working conditions. This can have long-term consequences on their physical and mental well-being, leading to a range of problems including poor health, low self-esteem, and limited future opportunities. Furthermore, child labor can also perpetuate the cycle of poverty, as children may be forced to work to support their families, rather than pursuing education and better job prospects.In my opinion, while some level of work experience can be beneficial for children, it is crucial that it does not compromise their education, health, and overall development. Governments and societies must ensure that children are protected from exploitation and have access to safe and regulated work environments. Ultimately, the decision to engage in paid work should be based on the individual child's circumstances, abilities, and priorities, rather than purely financial necessity. By striking a balance between work experience and protection of children's rights, we can help them develop into capable and responsible individuals, equipped to succeed in their future endeavors.
1411;In many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it to be a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion on this?;In the Third World, children are usually sent to factories for laborious work. Many people believe that it is merely exploitation, while others think it is a good opportunity for them to life experience. In any case, children have their right to live and study in peaceful conditions. Therefore, using them as workforce is considered an unacceptable action.First of all, children are not workers. They have just learned about the vast world and do not have any experience or concept of working. Since these innocent children are naive and , they can be easily cheated and exploited. There are many examples of this in poor nations. Because using children is cheap and to control, many enterprises hire them and don’t pay them much. Although the government in these countries has tried its best, this kind of taking advantage of children cannot be eliminated.Moreover, children do not need such thing as ‘valuable work experience’ that is supposedly ‘important for learning and taking responsibility’. The brief responsibility of children is learning. They are not old enough to understand what working experiences are. Nevertheless, they can help parents do chores or housework. This will be a much better way for them to become more responsible for . In addition, childhood is one of the most remarkable memories and must not be taken away by forcing them to work.In conclusion, since all children are the great concern of parent and society, they should be allowed to enjoy life and rather than to work. Hence, one must ponder what view is actually appropriate for the sake of the children.;"The notion that children should engage in paid work has sparked intense debate globally. While some argue that it provides valuable work experience and fosters responsibility, I firmly believe that children should not be involved in paid labor. Children are not workers; they are still in the process of learning and discovering the world around them. At a tender age, they lack the experience and concept of working, which makes them vulnerable to exploitation.The innocence and naivety of children make them an easy target for cheating and manipulation. Unscrupulous employers can take advantage of their ignorance, exploiting them for cheap labor without providing fair compensation or safe working conditions. This can have severe consequences on their physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Moreover, engaging children in paid work can deprive them of their childhood, which is a critical period for development and growth.The argument that paid work provides children with valuable experience and teaches them responsibility is misplaced. Children do not need such experience to learn and take responsibility. Instead, they should focus on acquiring education and developing essential life skills through play, socialization, and extracurricular activities. These activities are designed to promote their cognitive, emotional, and social development, preparing them for adulthood without exposing them to the harsh realities of the workforce. In conclusion, children should not be engaged in paid work. They deserve a childhood free from exploitation, where they can learn, play, and grow without the burden of labor. It is our responsibility to protect and nurture them, ensuring they reach adulthood equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in life."
361;In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?;"Money can not buy happiness! Is one of the most famous sayings while talking about finances. It is argued that topics around money, wealth, and poverty are becoming dramatically more frequent between humans in different countries around the world. In my opinion, the extream part of it is a negative development; although, it has some positivities. I will address some of both sides in this essay.Talking about money during the major part of the day might make the person look stingy and this is an attitude that majority of the community would not like, thus, might effect on the person's social life. Moreover, having the same topic in mind all day might lead to an obsession, and as a result, this could lead to a depression because the person might not find the proper way to reach to the financial position that meets their satisfaction, which could lead to depression, or even worse such as going through illegal paths where it could destroy their lives entirely!Nevertheless, the person should be aware of his /her income and spendings and try to enhance their financial position to the best possible way. Also, the inflation that we are currently living and the noticable increase in prices could be a driver for people to talk about money more often.In conclusion, people should not be obssessed in money and to talk with everyone about it all the time. However, I believe that people should discuss this matter in order to benefit from each other, and to find more ways to enhance their quality of life.";In recent years, it has become increasingly common for people in many countries to discuss money in their daily conversations. Topics around money, wealth, and poverty are becoming dramatically more frequent between humans in different countries around the world. This trend has sparked a debate about whether this development is positive or negative. In my opinion, the extreme part of it is a negative development, although it has some positivities.On the one hand, discussing money and financial matters can be beneficial as it allows people to share tips and advice on how to manage their finances effectively. It can also help to raise awareness about important issues such as poverty and income inequality. Moreover, talking about money can help to break down stigmas and taboos surrounding financial discussions, allowing people to be more open and honest about their financial situations.On the other hand, having the same topic in mind all day might lead to an obsession, and as a result, this could lead to depression. When people constantly talk about money, it can create a sense of materialism and greed, where the value of a person is measured by their wealth. This can lead to an unhealthy focus on wealth accumulation, rather than other important aspects of life such as relationships, personal growth, and well-being. Furthermore, excessive discussion of money can also lead to anxiety and stress, particularly for those who are struggling financially.In conclusion, while discussing money and financial matters can have some benefits, the extreme focus on it is a negative development. It is essential to strike a balance between being aware of financial issues and not letting it consume our lives. By being mindful of this balance, we can promote healthy and constructive conversations about money, rather than letting it lead to obsession and negativity.
671;In many countries women and men are working full time. It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;I strongly agree with this statement. If women and men are both working full time, they should share household works.First of all, if women and men are working full time, and they are working in the same amount of time, logically, the amount of time they do household works should be the sam e. However, if one of them work for longer hours, the household works should still be shared but the other one should do more household works.Second of all, everyone have responsibility to do household works because everyone lives in the house, makes the house dirty, creates dirty clothes and dishes. If there is only either women or men doing household works, it is not fair at all, because they both work full time.But as I mentioned before, the amount of time doing household works can be arranged, it doesn't have to be evenly shared. For instance, if the woman in this family work for longer hours or got an extra call by work, the man should help and do her part of household works. And when the man are working more, the woman should do the same. This does not only solve the problem of who should do household works but can also show that women and men are supporting each other in various situations.In conclusion, when women and men are both doing full time jobs, they should share household works. But it doesn't have to to be split in two halves, it can have alternatives depending on the working hours or special situations. In this way, the house can be more peaceful and have more harmony without arguments about who should do the household works.;The notion that women and men should share household responsibilities has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in countries where both partners work full-time. I strongly agree with this concept, as it not only promotes equality but also fosters a more harmonious and peaceful living environment.When both women and men work full-time, it is logical that they share the household chores. This division of labor is not only fair but also necessary, as it allows both partners to manage their time effectively and reduce stress. The sharing of household responsibilities does not necessarily mean that the workload should be divided evenly. Rather, the amount of time spent on household chores can be arranged in a way that suits both partners, taking into account their individual schedules and capabilities.By sharing household responsibilities, couples can create a more peaceful and harmonious home environment. When both partners feel that they are contributing equally to the household, they are more likely to feel appreciated and valued, leading to a stronger and more stable relationship. Furthermore, sharing household chores can also promote a sense of teamwork and cooperation, as both partners work together to maintain a clean and organized home.In conclusion, I strongly believe that when women and men work full-time, they should share household responsibilities. This sharing of chores not only promotes equality and fairness but also leads to a more peaceful and harmonious living environment. By arranging the amount of time spent on household chores in a way that suits both partners, couples can create a more balanced and stable home life, ultimately strengthening their relationship and improving their overall well-being.
1343;In many countries young people start living on their own after high school, is this a positive or negative development?;In many countries around the world young people decide to leave their parents’ home once they finish school. They start living on their own or sharing a house with friends. Is this a positive or a negative development? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples.Sample EssayNowadays it is becoming increasingly common for youngsters to start their independent life by moving out of their parents’ home after graduation from school. This trend has positive effects on the society and the reasons behind it will be discussed next in this essay.There are various benefits for both young people and their parents when individuals start living independently after finishing school. Young adults, in this way, have to take care of their daily needs, from house chores, cooking or cleaning to financial independence. Thus, instead of wasting time on childish activities, they are motivated to learn skills and work part-time or full-time in order to cover their living expenses. Although it might seem challenging for them to live on their own at first, it would give them valuable experience, helping them to become mature, responsible adults. Parents would also be pleased with this practice since they can enjoy their own lives by having more time for themselves. Not only would they have more financial flexibility due to independence of their children, but they also don’t have to change their habits in order to adapt to the new generation’s lifestyle. For instance, it allows many people to travel around the world, which would be impossible if their children were to stay with them after finishing high school.Admittedly, there might be some challenges involved in this way of life. In some cases and especially under the influence of new friends or housemates, youngsters might choose to get involved in dangerous activities that involve drugs or petty crimes. However, instead of keeping their children close through adulthood, parents should prepare in advance and raise their children to distinguish between right and wrong and teach them to take responsibility for their actions.In conclusion, although there might be some adverse consequences to this relatively new practice, I believe that the advantages of young people leaving family home outweigh its drawbacks, for both children and parents.;In many countries around the world, young people decide to leave their parents' home once they finish school. They start living on their own or sharing a house with friends. This development can be viewed as both positive and negative, depending on various factors.On the positive side, living independently after high school can be a valuable learning experience for young people. It teaches them important life skills such as managing finances, cooking, and time management. For instance, in countries like the United States and Australia, it is common for young people to move out of their parents' home and start living on their own or with friends after completing high school. This independence allows them to develop a sense of responsibility and self-reliance, which is essential for their future careers and personal lives.On the other hand, living on their own at a young age can also have negative consequences. For example, young people may struggle financially, as they have to pay for rent, food, and other living expenses on their own. This can lead to stress and anxiety, which can negatively impact their mental and physical health. Additionally, living away from family support can also make young people more vulnerable to bad influences and risky behaviors.In conclusion, whether young people living on their own after high school is a positive or negative development depends on individual circumstances. While it can provide valuable life experiences and a sense of independence, it also poses financial and emotional challenges. Ultimately, it is crucial for young people to be prepared and equipped with necessary life skills before making the decision to live on their own. With the right support and mindset, living independently can be a rewarding and enriching experience for young people.
1320;In many countries, a lot of food is wasted. Why do people waste food? How can we reduce the amount of food waste?;"Despite the fact that millions of people in the world go hungry every day, a surprisingly large amount of food gets wasted daily in certain parts of the world. In my opinion, the main reason for this is that people in the first-world countries tend to only buy food that is aesthetically pleasing, and fortunately, there are some ways to tackle this issue.It is shockingly sad to know that large amounts of perfectly edible food in the form of fresh produce get sent to landfills, and the main reason for this is that these foods do not meet the standards of perfection set for fruits and vegetables by consumers and grocery stores. For example, veggies and fruit that are misshapen or have a few spots on them are still good enough to eat, yet they are often left on shelves to rot in favour of something that looks less damaged. In addition, a lot of customers confuse the ‘best by’ and ‘use by’ dates, thinking that foods that have passed their ‘best by’ dates are no longer fit to eat. Another major reason for food wastage is that people often overestimate the amount of produce they require on a weekly or monthly basis, and most of it ends up getting thrown out instead of being used.There are many ways to reduce the amount of food being wasted, and I think one of the best ideas is to increase people’s awareness of just how much good food is disposed of, only because of our superficial biases as to how food should look. Raising the awareness of the staggering number of people that go hungry in third-world countries would make it harder to throw away an apple just because it is a little bruised. Also, teaching people how to better plan their monthly food requirements would help them not to overspend on food that they do not need; it would be great for the environment and their budget. The role of the government in this endeavour is indispensable as such task would be too great for any smaller organisation.To conclude, the wasting food is a serious issue that merits increased awareness from both people and the leaders of the world. It is unacceptable to discard any food when there are so many people who are starving, and hopefully our joint effort can help improve the current situation.";"The issue of food waste is a pressing concern in many parts of the world. Despite the fact that millions of people go hungry every day, a surprisingly large amount of food gets wasted daily in certain parts of the world. This paradox is particularly evident in first-world countries, where an abundance of food is often taken for granted. In my opinion, the main reason for this is that people in these countries tend to only buy food that is aesthetically pleasing. Consumers often prioritize the appearance of fruits and vegetables over their nutritional value, leading to a significant amount of edible food being discarded.This mindset is not only wasteful but also contributes to a culture of excess and disregard for the resources that go into producing and distributing food. Furthermore, the environmental and economic impacts of food waste are substantial, making it a problem that requires immediate attention. However, there are many ways to reduce the amount of good food being wasted. In my view, one of the best ideas is to increase people's awareness of just how much good food is disposed of. By educating consumers about the consequences of their actions, we can encourage them to make more mindful purchasing decisions and to appreciate the value of food, regardless of its appearance.Raising awareness can be achieved through various means, such as public campaigns, social media, and collaborations with food retailers. Additionally, implementing practical solutions like food recovery programs, composting initiatives, and promoting ""ugly"" fruit and vegetable campaigns can also play a significant role in reducing food waste. By adopting these strategies, we can work towards a more sustainable food system where less food is wasted, and more people have access to the nutrition they need. Ultimately, reducing food waste requires a collective effort, and by working together, we can make a significant difference."
1331;In many countries, young people are finding it harder and harder to find permanent jobs. Why is this happening? What can be done to improve the situation?;In this fast-moving age, with the development of education and modern technologies, people strive to have a secure job after graduating from colleges and universities. Despite their efforts, so many young adults in different parts of the world have a negative experience of finding a long-term job.It so happens that most colleges and universities focus on students’ academic performance much more than their practical skills. Unfortunately, many companies reserve permanent job opportunities for experienced applicants because there is no need to invest much in their training. Lack of practical experience in new graduates puts them at a disadvantage as far as companies are concerned. The situation is made worse by the abundance of advanced technologies that can easily replace human labor. Robots and computers work more efficiently and with higher precision than humans. That shrinks the pool of available job placements even more, as companies only need to hire highly educated and experienced staff.Fortunately, there is a number of solutions that can help inexperienced workers gain permanent employment. An obvious one is that universities could offer internships to their students, or arrange workshops in addition to classwork. This would help students to get training and experience in their respective fields. Also, the government could examine the demands of changing labor market and steer young people towards professions that will be popular in the coming years. Together with colleges and universities the government could create special awareness programs for graduates, providing them with an overview of various job offers and their benefits. This way students would be able to choose the right jobs for themselves.To sum up, lack of demand in the labour market and insufficient experience are two major reasons why many young people have trouble finding a permanent position. Helping them gain hands-on experience as part of their studies and educating them about career options early on is key to improving the employment outcome for them.;In many countries, young people are facing an increasingly challenging time finding permanent jobs. This phenomenon is widespread, affecting many young adults in different parts of the world, who often have a negative experience of finding a long-term job. One of the primary reasons for this difficulty is the lack of practical experience in new graduates, which puts them at a significant disadvantage as far as companies are concerned.Many universities and colleges focus on theoretical knowledge, leaving students with limited hands-on experience. As a result, when these graduates enter the job market, they lack the skills and expertise that employers require. Companies are often hesitant to hire inexperienced workers, as it requires additional investment in training and development. This creates a vicious cycle, where young people cannot gain experience because they cannot find a job, and they cannot find a job because they lack experience.To improve this situation, several steps can be taken. Firstly, educational institutions can be encouraged to incorporate more practical training and internships into their programs, allowing students to gain valuable work experience before graduating. Additionally, governments and private organizations can offer apprenticeships, training programs, and mentorship initiatives to help young people develop the skills they need to secure permanent employment. Furthermore, companies can also play a role by offering more entry-level positions and investing in the training and development of young employees. By working together, it is possible to address the challenges faced by young people in finding permanent jobs and provide them with the opportunities they need to succeed in their careers. Ultimately, it requires a collaborative effort to equip young people with the skills and experience necessary to thrive in the modern job market.
1318;In many workplaces online communication has overtaken face to face meetings. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?;In today’s ever-increasingly digital world, online communication has become the norm for many workplaces. While this development offers numerous advantages for companies such as greater flexibility and efficiency, it also brings with it certain disadvantages like miscommunication, which must be weighed against its benefits.One of the primary advantages of online communication is that it makes it easier for teams to stay in touch without having to physically convene. This is especially beneficial when individuals or groups are dispersed across vast distances. Reduced travel costs, as well as time saved from not having to travel to and from meetings, also represent meaningful savings for businesses. Additionally, online communication platforms often have a range of features designed to make collaboration more efficient, such as providing an easy way to share documents and other materials with remote team members. To illustrate, digital resources can be sent quickly and securely via email or other software services like Dropbox or Google Drive.There is a potential drawback associated with relying too heavily on online communication at work, as the lack of physical proximity between members of a team can often lead to misunderstandings due to a loss of context or nonverbal cues that would otherwise be present during face-to-face meetings. However, in my opinion, issues of this nature can be solved by using written language more carefully to avoid any confusion or miscommunication among colleagues.In conclusion, when online communication tools are used properly, they undoubtedly provide companies with greater flexibility in how their teams collaborate without sacrificing clarity of communication, quality or efficiency.;In today's increasingly digital world, online communication has become the norm for many workplaces. The rise of digital communication tools has led to a significant shift away from traditional face-to-face meetings, and towards online meetings and conversations. While this development offers numerous advantages for companies, such as greater flexibility and efficiency, it also brings with it certain disadvantages.On the one hand, online communication provides employees with the flexibility to work from anywhere and at any time, as long as they have a stable internet connection. This has led to increased productivity and efficiency, as employees can easily communicate and collaborate with each other, regardless of their physical location. Additionally, online communication reduces the need for lengthy and costly face-to-face meetings, allowing companies to save time and money.On the other hand, online communication also has its drawbacks. One of the main disadvantages is the potential for miscommunication. Without non-verbal cues, such as body language and facial expressions, online communication can often be misinterpreted, leading to misunderstandings and confusion. Furthermore, online communication can also lack the personal touch and human interaction that face-to-face meetings provide, leading to a sense of isolation and disconnection among employees.In conclusion, while online communication has become the norm in many workplaces, and offers numerous advantages, its disadvantages cannot be ignored. However, the advantages of online communication, such as greater flexibility and efficiency, do outweigh the disadvantages, such as miscommunication. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that online communication will become even more prevalent in the workplace, and companies must find ways to balance the benefits of online communication with the need for human interaction and personal connection.
713;In many workplaces, online communication is getting more common than meeting face to face. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?;According to COVID-19 event forced many company to change their way of working. One of the most significant transformation is the communication. The online communication becomes a must or inevitable for the company to be implemented. In this topic, we're going to disscuss the advantages and disadvantages for both ways of communications. The online meeting can introduce a significant impact to the organization while face to face meeting can be outdated for this new era of 2021.First of all for the online communication's advantages is that in the pandemic period the actual physical contact is a significant way to transmit the disease. Video conference can help mitigate this problem by lower the physical contact for each conversation or meeting. Also communicates through online channel can help individual to organize or manage their time efficiently according to each person preference. For example, a single mom parent may be able to spend times for her sons/daughters at home, while be able to have a cross country meeting with another department in other region. Another reason is that some people are quite introvert and find it difficult for face to face human interactions or conversations, in which online chat or messages can help them to mitigate this problem and communicate efficiently. Lastly as mentioned about video conference across region, online meeting can help the multi-national corporates save the transporations cost and additional resources needed to spend for face to face meeting.For the disadvantages, all of the online communications required hardware, internet connection and technological knowledge on how to use them. This technological gap can be seen as one of the most significant obstracle or disadvantage for people to use online communications. For example, in one company, there obviously have a various age of people, in which some of them are not familiar with the technology. Since video call conference has been introduced and utilized widespread among corporates not so long time ago. This can be a big technological gap for some people to use the online communications and result in a lost in communications among the workplaces.As a result, online communication helps an organization to reduce the risk of transmitting the disease, improved the time mangement ability and productivity for each individuals, and lower the financial cost or resources required to spends for international business activities. With all these advantages of online communication stated, they can be seens as a significant reasons to outweight the disadvantages of technological gap on this current year of 2021.;The shift towards online communication in workplaces has gained significant momentum, particularly in the wake of the pandemic. As we navigate this new era of 2021, it is essential to evaluate whether the advantages of online communication outweigh its disadvantages. In my opinion, the benefits of online communication far surpass its drawbacks, rendering face-to-face meetings somewhat outdated.First and foremost, online meetings have introduced a significant impact on organizations, allowing them to adapt and thrive in unprecedented times. During the pandemic, actual physical contact posed a substantial risk of disease transmission, making online communication a safer alternative. By leveraging online channels, individuals can minimize their exposure to potential health risks while maintaining productivity.Another significant advantage of online communication is its ability to facilitate efficient time management. With the flexibility to communicate through online channels, individuals can organize their time according to their preferences, allowing for a better work-life balance. This, in turn, can lead to increased job satisfaction and productivity, as employees can manage their tasks and responsibilities more effectively. Moreover, online communication tools enable seamless collaboration and information sharing,In conclusion, the advantages of online communication in the workplace, particularly in the context of the pandemic, are undeniable. As we move forward in this new era, it is clear that online meetings and communication are no longer just a supplement to face-to-face interactions but have become an essential component of modern workplace dynamics. By embracing online communication, organizations can ensure the well-being and productivity of their employees, ultimately driving success and growth.
1265;In recent years, the family structure has changed, as well as family roles. What are the changes occurring? Do you think these changes are positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In our modern days, families had witnessed a considerable change regarding their structure and the roles of individuals inside it. These changes are mainly the patriarchal structure that was dominating families in the past compared to a more balanced arrangement nowadays. In addition to that, there are more freedom and rights for women in recent years. And I believe its an advantageous development.Fathers used to be the only leaders of the families of past decades, however in recent days mothers had shared the leadership and started taking part in family decisions just like their partners. Also during recent decades women obtained greater deal of their civil rights which allowed them to take different roles from those that were common for females in the past decades. As an example, women can now own the family house, sign important documents, drive cars which were a breakthrough for women to be able to participate in family plannings and decisions.It appears to be an advantage to have women being able to be effective members of their families, that is because they can share responsibility, add their feminine qualities to the lives of their families as well as for them to be able to fulfill their own life by feeling the importance of their existence and their roles.As in a recent research that found families with women in them are happier, more content, and definitely healthier.In conclusion, the family system nowadays differs vastly from before, owing to the more roles that women are taking, and to the more rights and freedom they gained, and in my perspective it is a positive change.;The traditional family structure has undergone significant changes in recent years, leading to a shift in family roles. In our modern days, families have witnessed a considerable change regarding their structure and the roles of individuals inside it. Mainly, the patriarchal structure that was dominating families in the past has given way to a more balanced arrangement nowadays. This transformation has brought about a more equitable distribution of power and responsibilities among family members.One of the most notable changes is the increased freedom and rights for women. In the past, women were often relegated to domestic duties and had limited say in family decisions. However, with the advancement of women's rights and empowerment, women now have more autonomy and are able to pursue their own careers and interests. This has led to a more balanced and harmonious family environment, where both partners share responsibilities and make decisions together.I believe that these changes are overwhelmingly positive. With a more balanced structure, families are able to function more effectively and efficiently. Women are now able to contribute to the family income, which has improved the overall standard of living. Moreover, children benefit from having two involved and supportive parents, which has a positive impact on their emotional and psychological development. For instance, in many modern families, both parents share childcare responsibilities, allowing them to spend quality time with their children and provide a stable and loving environment. Overall, the changes in family structure and roles have been a welcome development, leading to more harmonious and equitable family relationships.
1399;In some countries children have very strict rules of behavior, in other countries they are allowed to do almost anything they like. To what extent should children have to follow rules?;Freedom plays a pivotal role in everybody’s life. We can see in today’s modernized era that nobody likes to be restricted, whether it is a child or an adult. Some people think that there should some strict rules of behavior for children, but I disagree with this statement.that sometimes more restrictions can cause more frustration in children, which leads to many other mental problems as well. they can . Sometimes they feel under pressure, which can be the main reason for their poor performance in their field. In some cases children may insist on doing .In other words we have to look other aspects as well, if we usually ignore our children’s bad habits, then they good human beings in their future life. Moreover if we never draw attention the children’s main activities then they might end up in a bad company. They the value of respect for their elders importance of relationships. They their cultural values as well.In a nutshell, I would like to say that children should be the value of their customs, rituals and respect towards their elders for their future life, but most of the additional restriction should . It would good human beings in their future.;The debate on the extent to which children should follow rules has sparked intense discussion in recent years. While some people think that there should be strict rules of behavior for children, I disagree with this statement. Implementing strict rules on children can have adverse effects on their mental and emotional well-being.On the one hand, having some rules in place can help children develop discipline and responsibility. However, the rules should be reasonable and not overly restrictive. Sometimes, more restrictions can cause more frustration in children, which can lead to many other mental problems, such as anxiety and depression. Children need the freedom to make choices, learn from their mistakes, and develop problem-solving skills. Overly strict rules can stifle their creativity, independence, and self-confidence.Moreover, giving children too many rules can lead to rebellion and resentment towards authority figures. Children who are raised in a highly restrictive environment may feel suffocated and develop a sense of resentment, which can negatively impact their relationships with parents, teachers, and peers. In contrast, children who are given more autonomy and freedom to make choices tend to be more confident, self-assured, and better equipped to handle the challenges of adulthood.In conclusion, while some rules are necessary for children's development, I firmly believe that they should not be overly restrictive. Children should be given the freedom to make choices, learn from their mistakes, and develop into capable and confident individuals. By striking a balance between rules and autonomy, parents and caregivers can help children develop into well-adjusted, responsible, and independent adults.
681;In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development;Nowadays, many businesses have to compete each other in order to survive from the rapidly changing world, leading to the high amount of time that employees spend on working. There are also other reasons why the employees work for a long period which I will discuss in this essay. In terms of consequences, I personally believe that spending most of our time at work is the negative development.It is the fact that people have various rationales to work for long hours. A classic example is the dynamic working condition. There are many companies that provide services such as consultation to customers, meaning that if their service does not completely satisfy the clients’ need, such client may decide to use the service from other competitors. Hence, the employees are required to dedicate their time to deliver the best service to the clients. Another common criticism is a bright career path. When the employees work for a long period, they can carefully check their works and, as a result, delivery the works with less mistakes. Doing this way could impress their manager and they are likely to get promotion in return.With a careful consideration regarding the consequence of working for long hours, there are many vital drawbacks. An obvious effect is the increase in illness. People who work very hard have to spend a lot of their time at work. Therefore, they may not have enough time to do exercises, weakening the immune system of their body. Furthermore, with the rise in the amount of working hours, people tend to lack social skills. This is because they may not be able to manage time to join social events or meet their friends, resulting in the less ability to adapt to new environments.In conclusion, it is undeniable that people work for long hours because of the requirement in business and personal career goal which, in my opinion, leads to negative development for themselves. This is because this behavior negatively affects their health condition and social competency which are the two most important aspects in our life.;In many countries, it is not uncommon for people to spend long hours at work. There are many reasons why employees work for a long period, which I will discuss in this essay. The phenomenon of extended working hours has become a topic of interest, with some arguing that it is a necessary evil, while others claim that it has detrimental effects on individuals and society.One of the obvious effects of long working hours is the increase in illness. People who work very hard have to spend a lot of their time at work, often at the expense of their physical and mental health. Prolonged periods of stress and fatigue can lead to a range of health problems, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and mental health disorders. Furthermore, with the rise in the amount of working hours, people tend to lack social skills, as they have limited time to interact with family and friends, leading to social isolation and loneliness.In my opinion, the trend of long working hours is a negative development. Not only does it affect the health and well-being of individuals, but it also has a negative impact on their personal relationships and overall quality of life. Moreover, it can also lead to a decline in productivity, as exhausted employees are less efficient and more prone to errors. Therefore, it is essential for governments and employers to take steps to regulate working hours, promote work-life balance, and encourage employees to prioritize their health and well-being. By doing so, we can mitigate the negative effects of long working hours and create a healthier, more sustainable, and more productive work environment.
101;In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .;Over decades, there has been a belief that adults should support adolescents to work in a company or travel to another country at least one year before going to university. Despite the fact that there are many positive aspects of having experiences in terms of working and travelling before studying at university, with a careful consideration, there are also negative points of this.It is true that working or travelling before starting a university program positively affects juveniles’ development. A classic example of this is an effective way to truly understand their academic preferences. When juveniles have work experiences, such as having a one-year internship in a company, they tend to learn a wide variety of work functions, helping them know the academic discipline they want to learn at university. Another benefit from taking a long journey to another place before studying at university is the opportunity to get exposed to new culture. This is because while adolescents are on an epic expedition to other parts of the world, they tend to meet new people with different nationality and belief, leading to valuable life experiences that they cannot receive from a professor at university.In spite of the aforementioned advantages of working or travelling before starting university courses, there are also drawbacks. A common example of this is graduating from a college late, compared to juveniles who immediately start a university program after they finish high school. This is exemplified by Thai culture which believes that young people who graduate from university later than their peer would not have a successful career path. In addition, opponents of this notion might argue that working before finishing university is not well worth doing. Since most works require a strong academic foundation in order for juveniles to deliver results with fewer mistakes, the juveniles should study at university instead.In conclusion, it is undeniable that having work experiences or taking a journey before starting a university life has many benefits for young people with respect to knowing the academic fields they want to study and learning new cultures outside a classroom. Nevertheless, doing this could also have drawbacks in terms of the delay in university graduation and an ineffective performance in working.;The concept of taking a gap year between finishing high school and starting university studies has been a topic of discussion in many countries. There has been a belief that adults should support adolescents to work in a company or travel to another country for at least one year before pursuing higher education. Proponents of this idea argue that it provides young people with valuable life experiences, independence, and a chance to develop important skills that can benefit them in the long run.On the one hand, taking a gap year can be incredibly beneficial for young people. It allows them to explore their interests, gain practical work experience, and develop a sense of responsibility and self-reliance. Traveling to another country can also broaden their cultural understanding and help them become more open-minded and adaptable. Moreover, a gap year can give students a much-needed break from academics, allowing them to recharge and refocus before embarking on their university journey.However, with careful consideration, there are also negative points to this approach. One significant disadvantage is that it can lead to a delay in completing university studies. A common example of this is graduating from college late, compared to juveniles who immediately start a university program after finishing high school. This can put students at a disadvantage in the job market, as they may be older than their peers and may have to deal with the financial burden of an additional year of living expenses. Additionally, some students may struggle to get back into the academic mindset after a year off, which can negatively impact their academic performance. Ultimately, whether or not to take a gap year is a personal decision that depends on individual circumstances and priorities.
1304;In some countries, boys and girls are educated separately after the age of about ten years old. Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;In many countries around the world, boys and girls are educated together. There is a group of countries, however, that educate boys and girls separately. This is frequently done on religious grounds, but not always. Having such a system can produce various advantages and disadvantages.One of the principal reasons for educating boys and girls separately is that, if they are together, they can distract each other. After puberty, boys can be strongly attracted to girls and vice versa, and this can result in disruptive conduct in the classroom as, for example, they show off to one another. Separating boys and girls can therefore have the distinct advantage of reducing this disturbing behaviour. However, some teachers have pointed out that this model does not always work, and that separated boys and girls are equally disruptive in class, and sometimes more so. These teachers say that having the opposite sex in the classroom can actually improve behaviour.Many educators also believe that boys and girls have different learning styles and needs. Separating boys and girls can allow teachers to address these needs more easily. There is also a belief that single sex schools allow gender stereotypes to be challenged and therefore education aspirations can be broadened.A major disadvantage of separating boys and girls in education is that the children miss important formative behavioural development when they do not have interaction with the other gender on a regular basis. This can lead to shyness and, more seriously, dysfunctional relationships later in life. Some people also feel that mixed sex schools can promote gender stereotypes rather than reducing them.In conclusion, I feel that children should be educated all together, although I would respect a system in which they are separated due to religious beliefs. My personal opinion is that different genders should learn to interact together from an early age, as this would allow them to develop healthy working relationships with each other.;The issue of whether boys and girls should be educated separately or together has been a topic of debate in many countries. In many countries around the world, boys and girls are educated together, sharing the same classrooms and learning experiences. However, there is a group of countries, however, that educate them separately, often after the age of ten. This separation is frequently done on religious grounds, but not always.Some argue that separate education for boys and girls promotes a more focused and distraction-free learning environment. They believe that when boys and girls are educated together, they can be distracted by each other, leading to a decrease in academic performance. On the other hand, proponents of co-education argue that it prepares students for real-life situations, where men and women work together and interact with each other. It also fosters mutual respect, understanding, and healthy relationships between the sexes.In my opinion, educating boys and girls together is more beneficial. It allows them to develop social skills, such as communication, teamwork, and conflict resolution, which are essential in today's society. Moreover, it helps to break down gender stereotypes and promotes equality between the sexes. For example, in countries like the United States and Australia, boys and girls are educated together, and these countries have made significant progress in promoting gender equality.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments for both separate and co-education, I believe that educating boys and girls together is more beneficial. It promotes social skills, equality, and prepares students for real-life situations. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, it is essential that we educate our children to be tolerant, respectful, and understanding of each other, regardless of their sex.
785;In some countries, only few young people go to classical music concerts or or play classical music. Why? Should young people be encouraged to attend and learn more?;Classical music is one of the oldest artistic samples of our history. However, the young people of the new generations do not appreciate this kind of music. I believe that governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and I will support my stand with valid arguments in the following paragraphs.First of all, the main reason behind the little interest of young people in classical music is the impact of globalization in music and arts. That is because people have the opportunity to know more about multiple things without leaving their homes. However, all this knowledge is only superficial and arts, more specifically classical music, is diminished by the big international industry of music. For instance, reggaeton music, despite the fact that its lyrics are often misogynous, is the most popular style of music these days.Another reason is that children and young people have less interest in cultural matters than in the past because governments do not invest in culture and arts. In most countries, investment in culture has been drastically reduced and young people have no access to classical music concerts and much less a musical instrument that has a huge cost. Consequently, governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and the arts.To summarise, this essay has examined the idea of classical music and why young people do not have an interest in this kind of music. As far as I am concerned governments should take responsibility in this matter and invest more money in culture and classical music encouraging young people to learn more about this kind of art.;The appreciation and preservation of classical music have become a concern in recent years, as it appears that only a few young people attend classical music concerts or play classical music. Classical music is one of the oldest artistic samples of our history, with roots dating back centuries. It has played a significant role in shaping the cultural and artistic heritage of many countries. However, young people of the new generations do not seem to appreciate this kind of music, with many preferring modern genres such as pop and rock.This trend is alarming, as classical music has the power to enrich our lives, broaden our perspectives, and provide a deeper understanding of our cultural roots. I believe that governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and the arts. By doing so, they can help to preserve the cultural heritage of their country and foster a new generation of classical music enthusiasts. Governments can achieve this by incorporating classical music education into school curricula,,,Additionally, governments can also organize concerts, workshops, and other events that showcase classical music in an engaging and accessible way. This can help to break down the perception that classical music is boring or elitist, and show young people that it can be enjoyable and relevant to their lives. By encouraging young people to attend and learn more about classical music, we can ensure that this valuable part of our cultural heritage is preserved and continues to thrive for generations to come. Ultimately, it is our responsibility to promote and preserve classical music, and I believe that governments, educational institutions, and individuals must work together to achieve this goal.
1334;In the modern world, it is possible to shop, work and communicate with people via the Internet and live without any face-to-face contact with others. Is it a positive or negative development?;The feasibility of shopping, working and communicating through the Internet is gradually eliminating the necessity of in-person encounters. I believe the merits of this opportunity outnumber its demerits and the lowered volume of traffic in addition to the possibility of long-range communication will be discussed as reasons for this claim in this essay.One chief benefit of using the Internet as a means of making purchases, working and communicating would be the lowered demand for transport, through eradicating the need for face-to-face contact. Such decreased volume of transportation would result in fewer harmful gas emissions which could significantly contribute to creating a cleaner environment. Furthermore, reduced commuting burden yields more free time for individuals. It could be spent in various ways such as working, studying and socialising with family and friends to name a few, which would be more productive and enjoyable.Another key merit of using the Internet would be the emergence of state-of-the-art telecommunication applications. These technologies have made it possible for those with access to the Internet to get in touch and send and receive audiovisual content by pushing just a few buttons. This presents a stark contrast to the situation only a few decades ago, when long-distance communication was possible solely through paper-based letters, which could possibly take months to reach the recipient.There are, however, some drawbacks to online communication, in particular the possibility that the lack of contact brought by technological advancements could potentially weaken human bonds. Taking into consideration that humans are sociable species, this could pose a dire threat to our mental health. This predicament, however, would be mitigated by the extra free time technological developments create for us. This free time could be spent with friends and family and in the long run would strengthen our relationships and improve our emotional wellbeing.To recapitulate, the Internet’s demolishing the need for person-to-person contact brings about numerous benefits. A more sustainable environment as well as more free time generated for individuals, a reduced need to commute in addition to the feasibility of conducting long-distance communication in the easiest way possible, are all instances of the above-mentioned merits.;The advent of the Internet has revolutionized the way we live, work, and interact with one another. With the rise of online shopping, virtual workplaces, and digital communication platforms, it is now possible to live without any face-to-face contact with others. In my opinion, this development is largely positive.One of the primary merits of using the Internet as a means of making purchases, working, and communicating is the lowered demand for transport. With the ability to shop and work online, people no longer need to commute to physical stores or offices, resulting in a significant reduction in transportation needs. This, in turn, leads to a decrease in the volume of harmful gas emissions released into the atmosphere, contributing to a cleaner and healthier environment.Moreover, the reduced commuting burden yields more free time for individuals, which can be utilized for personal development, leisure activities, or spending quality time with family and friends. This can lead to improved mental and physical well-being, as well as stronger social bonds. Additionally, the Internet has opened up new opportunities for remote work, allowing people to work from anywhere, at any time, and has enabled global connectivity, facilitating international collaborations and friendships.While some may argue that the lack of face-to-face interaction can lead to social isolation, I believe that the benefits of an Internet-driven lifestyle far outweigh the drawbacks. Overall, the ability to shop, work, and communicate via the Internet has improved our quality of life, reduced our environmental footprint, and increased our productivity. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that we will see even more innovative ways to leverage the Internet for a better future.
1344;In the past people wore their traditional clothes, but these days most people wear similar clothes, is this a positive or negative development?;In the past, people wore their traditional clothes and followed their culture. These days, most people wear similar clothes and therefore look very similar to one another. Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?Sample EssayThese days, people’s perspectives on the value of clothing are changing, and individuals tend to wear similar clothing compared to people in the past who opted for their traditional clothing. I believe this tendency exerts a positive influence on the society.It is certainly true that there are some drawbacks to this tendency because it may lead to a loss of global diversity. It can be argued those who wear ordinary clothes such as T-shirts and jeans cannot feel a connection to their roots, and they are likely to neglect their culture and the contribution of their ancestors. Therefore, these people may not take pride in their region, and they might migrate to an urban location rather than contribute to the development of their community. Consequently, many ethnic minorities could suffer from depopulation and eventually disappear.However, I believe that there are more positives than negatives in people opting for similar clothes. The first explanation is that individuals can feel a sense of unity with people all over the world even though they have different religions and ways of life. This would motivate people in the world to support one another, instead of thinking that different parts of the world should deal with their own problems when natural disasters and other terrible problems occur in different nations. Furthermore, this tendency is economically profitable. Generally speaking, as ordinary clothes are automatically manufactured, they can be produced faster and more affordably than traditional clothing such as Japanese Kimono, which is hand-crafted.In conclusion, although people today tend to wear similar clothes instead of traditional ones and this trend cause several problems, I believe that the society as a whole can reap more benefits of this tendency.All parts of the task have been covered. The writer presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt with suitable, widely covered and sufficiently supported ideas. The paragraphing is handled appropriately. The range of vocabulary allows the writer to convey the intended meaning. The overall control of grammar and punctuation is fine, with only a few errors mostly related to word choice (hover/tap on corrections in blue for details). Well done! Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;The world has undergone significant changes in recent years, and one of the most noticeable transformations is in the way people dress. In the past, people wore their traditional clothes and followed their cultural heritage with pride. Each community had its unique attire, which reflected its history, values, and customs. However, these days, most people wear similar clothes, and the distinction between different cultures has started to fade away.On one hand, this trend can be seen as a positive development. The fact that people from different parts of the world are now wearing similar clothes suggests a sense of global unity and equality. It is easier for people to communicate and connect with one another when they share similar interests and appearances. Moreover, the spread of similar clothing styles has made it easier for people to travel and work in different countries, as they can easily blend in with the local population.On the other hand, this development can also be seen as a negative trend. The loss of traditional clothing and cultural identity can lead to a homogenization of societies, where unique customs and values are lost. When people wear similar clothes, they look very similar to one another, and the individuality and diversity that traditional clothes provided are lost. Furthermore, the dominance of a single clothing style can also lead to the decline of local textile industries and the loss of traditional craftsmanship.In conclusion, while the trend of wearing similar clothes has its advantages, it also has its drawbacks. It is essential to strike a balance between embracing global unity and preserving cultural diversity. By doing so, we can ensure that our world remains a vibrant and diverse place, where people can express their individuality and cultural heritage with pride.
641;"Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference. To what extent do you agree or disagree?";There is no doubt these days that the action of the individual is not powerful enough to make the environment better. Unless through laws created by the government and activities have been taken by companies that have a high impact. I strongly disagree with this idea. because there are other ways to help the government as an individual.In essay will prove my point with reasons and examples.Nowadays, people can use social media as a platform that has the power to tell people around the world how to behave. Therefore, an individual has the power to convince others to give higher attention to our environment and create a community that has specific goals to improve. For example, social media influencers could educate the volunteer and work with the youth to make the environment better. For instance, show the young people how to sort the waste and how dangerous the impact is if they do not act in such as way.Moreover, as individuals, people can start doing many actions which benefit the environment by themselves without obstructions. On the other hand, the government and companies should be aware too. For example, while the companies use the factories the government must be monitoring the discharge of fule.In conclusion, after carefully explaining my points of view, in my opinion, it is not necessary to wait for the government and the big companies to act activity for the environment because we as individuals can create and provide educational activities for the public to preserve the environment for the next generation.;The notion that individuals can do nothing to improve the environment, and that only governments and large companies can make a difference, has gained significant attention in recent years. There is no doubt these days that the action of the individual is not powerful enough to make the environment better, or so it seems. However, I disagree with this statement, and in this essay, I will prove my point with reasons and examples.While it is true that governments and large companies have more resources and influence, individuals can still make a significant impact when collective action is taken. For instance, the power of social media has revolutionized the way people can contribute to environmental awareness. Nowadays, people can use social media as a platform that has the power to tell people around the world how to behave in an environmentally friendly manner. A single post or tweet can inspire hundreds of people to make small changes in their daily lives, such as reducing plastic use or conserving water.Moreover, individual actions can collectively lead to significant positive change. For example, the reduction of single-use plastics has been driven in part by individuals making conscious choices about their daily purchases. As more people make these choices, businesses and governments are forced to take notice and implement larger-scale changes. Therefore, I believe that individuals can, and do, make a difference in improving the environment. It is essential to recognize the value of individual actions and to continue to empower people to take small steps towards creating a more sustainable future. By working together, individuals, governments, and large companies can achieve far more than any one entity could alone.
1237;"Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.";"Pollution free environment is important for our life's health and even enjoyement.Everyone whether an individual or large entitiy has an impact on the environment; regardless whether it was good or bad. Hence, I believe it is the responsibility of individulas as well as governments and large companies.Individuals can do a lot to improve the environemt around them starting with taking some actions to make a difference. For example, every memeber in the sociaty can support recycling efforts by sorting their garbages into different categoreis, instead of wasting the efforts of recycling companies to do so. Another exmaple would be to stop using plastic products and replace them with more environemt friendly products like pepar products.Moreover, teaching and spreading awarness about the importance of keeping our environemt clean are another way to make a difference. For instance, we can use social media to spread awarness and start campaigns about enviorment and pollution. Furthermore, we can teach some classes in schools and universities about this subject. As a result, this will help the upcoming generations to understand the problem and have them continue the efforts of improvement.While individuals efforts are essential, they must be supported by governments and large companies in order to complete the circle. A main example here would be establishing regulations and laws that would minimze the damage to the environment and maintain pollution at low levels, which is the role of the governments around the world. As for large companies, they can support by adopting the best practicies and take the proper actions to reduce pollution and improve the environment. As an example, they can start using clean and renewable energies to power their facilities and plants. In addition, those companies can develop technologies that contributes toward keeping the environment safe, and prompet the use of clean energy and vehicales.To sum up, the responsibility to improve the environemt must be divided between all three parties individuals, governments, and large companies. Each has his role to enhnace the environemnt and reduce the pollution. They complete each other and they should work together toward a better future for our world.";"I strongly disagree with the statement that individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference. A pollution-free environment is crucial for our life's health and enjoyment, and it is essential that everyone, whether an individual or a large entity, plays a role in maintaining it. Every single action, no matter how small, has an impact on the environment, and collective efforts can lead to significant positive change.I believe it is the responsibility of individuals, as well as governments and large companies, to work towards protecting the environment. Individuals can make a difference by making conscious choices in their daily lives, such as reducing energy consumption, using public transport, recycling, and avoiding single-use plastics. These small actions may seem insignificant, but when combined with the efforts of others, they can have a substantial impact.Moreover, individual actions can also influence governments and large companies to adopt more environmentally friendly policies. For instance, consumer demand for eco-friendly products can encourage companies to shift towards sustainable production methods. Similarly, public pressure can prompt governments to implement and enforce environmental regulations. Examples of successful environmental movements, such as the reduction of plastic bag use and the increase in renewable energy sources, demonstrate the power of collective individual action.In conclusion, while governments and large companies have a significant role to play in environmental protection, individuals should not underestimate their own ability to make a difference. By taking responsibility for their own actions and working together, individuals can contribute significantly to creating a cleaner, healthier, and more enjoyable environment for everyone. It is a shared responsibility that requires the active participation of all stakeholders, including individuals, governments, and large companies, to achieve a sustainable future."
1301;It is a fact that the majority of people who are sent to prison commit further crime after their release.What is causing this? What can be done to change this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is a sad fact that criminals who leave prison go on to commit further crime. There are various reasons for this, but there are also some things that can be done to prevent it from happening.One reason for this recidivism is due to a lack of legitimate income. Many people turn to crime as they cannot find an alternative to earn money. When such person comes out of prison, it is very often the case that they have the same few opportunities for a legitimate income. In fact, these opportunities will even be reduced, as employers are often less willing to give an ex-prisoner a job. Some people also return to crime, as they spend all the time of their prison sentence with other criminals. This is not a great environment for rehabilitation, and sometimes even a network of contacts can be made to help develop criminal activities on release.One important way to help address this problem is education. Criminals who have turned to illegal activities because of no alternatives to earn a living need to learn a way to earn a wage, such as a trade or vocational skills. Computer skills, for example, are in high demand and someone trained in these could very possibly find work. In addition, governments can offer incentives to employers to attract them to give jobs to newly-released prisoners. This would help people who don’t really want to return to crime achieve a fresh start. As keeping people in prison is an expensive business, governments might find it cheaper to pay these incentives.To sum up, people returning to crime is a tragedy that should be avoided if at all possible in today’s society. Education and incentives can directly address the reasons for it and could make society a happier and safer place.;The reality that the majority of individuals released from prison go on to commit further crimes is a pressing concern for society. This phenomenon is attributed to various factors, including lack of education, unemployment, and the absence of rehabilitation programs within the prison system. Many prisoners are released back into their communities without the necessary skills or support to lead a law-abiding life, making it inevitable that they revert to criminal behavior.However, there are steps that can be taken to break this cycle of recidivism. Education and incentives are key components in addressing the root causes of repeated offending. By providing prisoners with access to educational programs and vocational training, they can acquire the skills necessary to secure employment and become productive members of society. Incentives, such as reduced sentences or early release for those who participate in rehabilitation programs, can also motivate prisoners to make positive changes in their lives.For instance, countries that have implemented comprehensive rehabilitation programs, which include education, job training, and counseling, have seen significant reductions in recidivism rates. These programs not only equip prisoners with practical skills but also help them to address underlying issues, such as substance abuse or mental health problems, that may have contributed to their criminal behavior. By investing in the rehabilitation of prisoners, society can become a happier and safer place. Education and incentives can directly address the reasons for repeated crime, reducing the likelihood of ex-prisoners committing further crimes and promoting a more law-abiding and productive community. Ultimately, it is through such proactive and supportive measures that we can hope to reduce recidivism and create a more just and peaceful society.
1336;It is believed that people who read for pleasure develop their imagination more and acquire better language skills compared to people who prefer watching television. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Some people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. Personally, I support this opinion for several reasons, which will be laid out in this essay.As we all know, books use text to convey ideas and quite often there are no images or illustrations to picture the scenes described in the book; therefore, we have to use our own imagination while reading. For example, reading a fantasy novel that contains mythical creatures one would normally see the appearance of those characters in their mind while following the plot. In contrast, movie heroes on a TV screen are usually created for the viewer by directors and producers of the film. Watching TV substitutes the need to develop one’s own imagination because the characters and their surroundings are shown on the screen.Furthermore, it is argued that reading is the best way to expand one’s vocabulary. The reader learns the correct spelling of a word by seeing it printed in a book, and they grasp its meaning from the context, without having to look it up in a dictionary. Not only new words but also numerous sentence structures can be learnt from books. To take advantage of these benefits English teachers in many schools use English novels as teaching materials. Students are asked to read the story and capture the keywords to answer the questions in the exam. In comparison, learning new words while watching a TV show isn’t always easy because the viewer’s attention is drawn to the action on the screen and if there are no subtitles, the spelling of the words is not obvious. All this makes a book a more effective tool for a language learner compared to TV.In conclusion, I believe people who love to read tend to have a more active imagination and advanced linguistic comprehension than those who watch television, since readers are required to imagine the story in the book and learn the meaning of new words from the context.";The notion that people who read for pleasure develop their imagination more and acquire better language skills compared to people who prefer watching television has garnered significant attention in recent years. Some people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. I support this opinion for several reasons, which will be laid out in this essay.Firstly, reading exposes individuals to a vast array of vocabulary, grammatical structures, and linguistic styles, thereby enriching their language proficiency. Through reading, people are able to encounter complex sentence structures, idiomatic expressions, and nuanced language use, all of which contribute to a more sophisticated command of language. In contrast, television, with its reliance on visual and auditory cues, often oversimplifies language, limiting the viewer's exposure to intricate linguistic patterns.Furthermore, reading fosters imagination and creativity by presenting readers with descriptive passages, vivid imagery, and abstract concepts that stimulate the mind and encourage creative thinking. As readers engage with written texts, they are compelled to visualize settings, characters, and events, thereby exercising their imaginative faculties. This is in stark contrast to television, which presents a more passive experience, where images and ideas are explicitly conveyed, leaving little room for imaginative extrapolation.In conclusion, I firmly believe that reading for pleasure has a profound impact on the development of language skills and imagination, far surpassing the benefits offered by watching television. By engaging with written texts, individuals can broaden their linguistic horizons, exercise their creative faculties, and cultivate a more nuanced understanding of the world around them. As such, I strongly advocate for the importance of reading in fostering intellectual and creative growth.

1296;It is the responsibility of individuals to save and provide for their own retirement. Governments have no obligation to provide this benefit.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The responsibility for providing funds for retirement is incredibly important and something that is often overlooked by younger people. Some believe it is the responsibility of the individual to plan for this, but others feel it is the responsibility of the state.People who believe that the state should be responsible for funding retirees, base their argument on the fact that in most countries, people pay taxes and social charges to the government. This money, they argue, should also go towards the provision of a pension for the person paying the tax. In addition, those who have very small or no income, pay little or no tax and do not have the ability to provide for themselves. The government, therefore, in its role of caring for the population, has an obligation to pay a pension and provide other social benefits, such as medical treatment.Many others, however, feel that it is the responsibility of individuals to fund their own retirements. As adults, they argue, people should be able to set aside and invest money throughout their lifetime, so that they can retire with few financial worries. In many countries the government has legislated a framework allowing and encouraging citizens to save up and accumulate sufficient funds for the period after their working years have ended.I neither agree nor disagree with the statement, but rather my opinion takes in parts of both arguments. I feel that people should be responsible for saving money to fund their retirement, but I also feel that individuals who have not had the chance to do so should be supported by the government out of taxes. In my view, therefore, it is wrong to say that governments have no obligation to help people in this area. Governments are there to support the entire population of their countries, which includes the poorer elements of society.;The statement that it is the responsibility of individuals to save and provide for their own retirement, with no obligation from governments, has sparked a heated debate. Some believe it is the responsibility of the individual to plan for their retirement, arguing that this encourages personal responsibility and financial independence. On the other hand, others feel that it is a responsibility for the state to fund retirees, as they have contributed to the economy and society throughout their working lives.In my opinion, it is wrong to say that governments have no obligation to help. While individuals should indeed take an active role in planning for their retirement, governments also have a moral and social responsibility to ensure that their citizens are protected and supported in their old age. Many people are not in a position to save adequately for retirement due to various factors such as low income, limited access to pension schemes, or unexpected expenses. Without government support, these individuals would be left vulnerable and at risk of poverty in their retirement.Furthermore, government-funded retirement schemes can also have a positive impact on the economy. For instance, pension payments can contribute to the circulation of money and stimulate economic growth. Additionally, a well-planned retirement system can reduce the burden on younger generations and the healthcare system, as retirees are able to maintain a decent standard of living without relying heavily on their families or the state for support. Therefore, while individual responsibility is crucial, it is unrealistic and unfair to expect individuals to bear the sole responsibility for their retirement. Governments should work in tandem with individuals to ensure a secure and dignified retirement for all citizens.
1287;It must be a woman who stays at home to care for children. Men are not suited to this kind of work. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Traditionally in many parts of the world, it has been women who have stayed at home to care for children. This has led to the ideology and expectation that women are more suited to this type of work than men.The overwhelming status quo where women stay at home to care for the children probably derives from the fact that women are the ones who have to actually give birth to children and, following that, they are the ones who for the early part of a child’s life have to feed the child until it is weaned. In times past, this state of affairs probably led to the women assuming the permanent role of carer for the home and children, whilst men went out to work, whether it was to gather food or work in fields or factories.In spite of the fact that this became what was expected in family dynamics, it does not mean that men are necessarily less suited to caring for a child than women. It is very possible for men to care for a child, even from birth onwards in today’s world. Babies’ milk formula can be mixed by anyone and fed to a child. The fact that many women today choose not to do this again does not mean that they are better suited by nature to care for the child.Suitability for childcare is a matter for individual temperament and aptitude. Not many people, whether they are men or women, feel totally confident and knowledgeable about how to care for a baby or young child at the start. They need advice from their own mothers and fathers, midwives or from books. It is only from experience that skill with childcare comes and this skill can be acquired regardless of gender.All in all, I do not agree with the statement that men are less suited to childcare than women. I believe that aptitude to look after children is a matter of individual temperament, not gender-specific inherited qualities.;The notion that it must be a woman who stays at home to care for children, and that men are not suited to this kind of work, is a stereotype that has been prevalent in many parts of the world. Traditionally, it has been women who have taken on the role of primary caregivers, managing the household and raising children. However, this does not mean that men are necessarily less suited to caring for a child than women. In fact, aptitude to look after children is a matter of individual temperament, not gender-specific inherited qualities.There are numerous examples of men who have successfully taken on the role of primary caregivers, demonstrating that they are just as capable as women in providing nurturing and care to children. Some fathers have even become stay-at-home dads, dedicating themselves to raising their children and managing the household. These men have shown that with patience, love, and dedication, they can be excellent caregivers, dispelling the myth that men are not suited for this kind of work.Moreover, in many modern societies, the traditional roles of men and women are evolving, and an increasing number of men are taking on more active roles in childcare. This shift is not only beneficial for the children, who get to experience the love and care of both parents, but also for the fathers themselves, who can develop a deeper bond with their children. It is essential to recognize that caring for children is a skill that can be developed by anyone, regardless of their gender, and that what matters most is the willingness to learn, adapt, and provide love and support to the child.In conclusion, the idea that only women can stay at home to care for children and that men are not suited for this kind of work is an outdated and sexist notion. It is crucial to acknowledge that the ability to care for children is not determined by gender, but by individual characteristics, such as patience, empathy, and dedication. By recognizing and valuing the importance of both mothers and fathers in childcare, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and equitable society, where all individuals can contribute to the upbringing and care of children, regardless of their gender.
1105;It's generally believed that success in fields such as art and sport can only be achieved if a person has natural talent. However, it's sometimes claimed that any child can be taught to become a good sports person or artist.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"It is common to think that in fields like art or sport success is linked to natural talent, even though it is stated that children can obtain good results also trough learning and pratice.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------In my opinion, I believe that only a combination of natural talent and sacrifice can lead you to obtain success; for this reason, you can learn and improve several skills, but you will not win against a person with this type of gift, unless this person does not pratice enough.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------To provide an example, if we think about Raffaello, one of the most remarkable painters of all times, and his life we may be disappointed; in fact, thanks to his natural talent he started to paint since he was 8.However, we have to bear in mind that he constantly made a research in order to discover new techniques and to gain new inspirations.If he was not so focused on his art's improvement, he would not be able to paint an entire church.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------If we move to another field as sport is always more evident the existence of a pattern. Indeed, it is crystal clear that professional players need to pratice everyday, regardless their talent.However, Ronaldo this year has winned the nominee for the best football player in the world not only for his innate talent but also for the effort put during training in order to reach always an higher goal.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------In conclusion, through commitment you will obtain good results, but to achieve the highest level you must be gifted with a natural talent.";The notion that success in fields such as art and sport is solely dependent on natural talent is a widely held belief. Many people assume that one must be born with an innate ability to excel in these areas. However, it is also argued that any child can be taught to become a skilled sports person or artist through dedication and practice. In my opinion, I believe that a combination of both natural talent and hard work is necessary to achieve success.On one hand, it is undeniable that natural talent can give individuals an edge in these fields. For instance, a child who demonstrates a natural aptitude for painting or playing a musical instrument may find it easier to learn and improve. On the other hand, it is also true that learning and practice can help individuals develop their skills and achieve good results. With consistent effort and guidance, children can acquire the necessary skills to excel in their chosen field.However, I believe that natural talent alone is not enough, and neither is practice and learning. It is the combination of both that can lead to true success. For example, a child who has a natural talent for soccer but never practices or dedicates themselves to improving their skills is unlikely to become a professional player. Conversely, a child who has no natural talent but is willing to put in the time and effort to learn and practice can still achieve a high level of success. Ultimately, it is the sacrifice and dedication that one is willing to make that will determine their level of achievement. In conclusion, while natural talent can provide a foundation, it is the combination of talent and hard work that will ultimately lead to success in fields such as art and sport.
1420;Learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Evaluation of the importance of timing is essential, past to show the importance of their present, while that to even remember their past because it would not help them at all. It is a very controversial and complicated matter., many people believe this statement, for many reasons. Firstly, all of us had made many mistakes which we would not like to remember, they will affect their present because they can create some problems with our families example. Secondly, instead of remembering those past trials, one should get the benefits of their present.Regardless of what I said previously, many people are sticking to their past to give themselves a push in their present. It can give a way of learning from mistakes, and a good chance to try to avoid anything that once lead to a past failure.Moreover, success will not come without failure, everybody should make an attempt, even if it fails, and it may become a big success if they try it again and again. In addition, our past is our culture and heritage which we should not forget at all, it is a matter of value to our present and future, and will remain such till the day will die.To sum up, in my opinion, we can not live without a past, it is our value of life. it can help create your experiences and solve your problems better in the future.;The statement that learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present is a notion that I strongly disagree with. In my opinion, we cannot live without a past, as it is our value of life. The past serves as a foundation for our present and future, providing invaluable lessons and experiences that shape who we are today.Learning about the past allows us to understand the complexities of human history, the rise and fall of civilizations, and the triumphs and failures of individuals. These lessons can help create our experiences and solve our problems better in the future. By studying historical events, we can identify patterns and mistakes, enabling us to make more informed decisions and avoid repeating the same errors. For instance, the Great Depression of the 1930s taught us the importance of regulating financial markets and implementing social safety nets, which has helped mitigate the effects of subsequent economic downturns.Moreover, our cultural heritage and traditions are rooted in our past. Understanding and appreciating our history helps us to preserve our identity and pass it down to future generations. It also fosters empathy, tolerance, and cooperation among different communities, as we learn to respect and value the diversity of human experiences. In conclusion, learning about the past is essential for those of us living in the present, as it provides a rich source of knowledge, experience, and wisdom that can guide us in making better decisions and creating a brighter future. Therefore, I firmly believe that our past is an integral part of our lives, and its value should not be underestimated.
1197;Learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Learning about the past may provide advantages and disadvantages, depending on the position we are situate ourselves in life ;Undoubtedly, it has great advantages for the ones who need to progress in life, despite what they had been through, because to my opinion, greatest lessons in life come with our own experiences. Advantages of learning about the past are also on the side of the ones who personally know themselves very well and stay honest to themselves at all times.For example, someone who try to be someone, acting to please influent people or trying to get somewhere he or she would not be able to if he were playing real, could be embarrassed by their own mistakes or feeling humiliated when looking back to what he accomplished to get where he/she is now ; therefore the past in this situation would not be a great option for him to look back after.Despite this kind of personality, there are lots of people who find out constructive knowledge in looking back to the past, regardless of how great or bad it could be.The kind of people who actually face their own past and do not try to hide it are the ones who are not scared of how people will judge them, but are willing to make greate changes in their future.It is ,to me, the definition of true progress; how could we learn from our own experiences if we are not willing to face ourselves ?Past can be hurtful but I do think that everything we have been through is a constructive lesson for today and tomorrow.";I disagree with the statement that learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present. Learning about the past may provide both advantages and disadvantages, depending on the position we situate ourselves in life. However, it undoubtedly has great advantages for those who need to progress in life. In my opinion, the greatest lessons in life come from our own experiences. Every experience, whether good or bad, shapes us into who we are today and prepares us for the future.The past offers a wealth of knowledge and wisdom that can be applied to our present and future. By studying historical events, cultural traditions, and the achievements of our predecessors, we can gain valuable insights into the complexities of human nature, the consequences of our actions, and the importance of perseverance and resilience. These lessons can help us make informed decisions, avoid repeating past mistakes, and build upon the successes of those who came before us.Moreover, learning about the past can foster empathy, understanding, and appreciation for the diversity of human experiences. It allows us to recognize the progress made in various fields, such as science, technology, and social justice, and to acknowledge the sacrifices and contributions of individuals who have paved the way for us. I firmly believe that everything we have been through is a constructive lesson for today and tomorrow. By embracing our past, we can create a brighter, wiser, and more compassionate future. Therefore, learning about the past is essential for personal growth, social progress, and the betterment of our collective future.
1297;Many cities have areas where the only cars are taxis and buses.Is this a positive or a negative development? What are the effects of this on individuals and society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Banning cars from the centre of various cities around the world has been a strategy to reduce pollution and encourage people to use public transport. It has had various positive effects for both individuals and for society as a whole.Banning cars from the centre of cities seems to be a very positive development. Fewer cars on the road means less pollution and fewer fossil fuel resources being used up. Although the effect on resources might be relatively negligible, it can create a newer way of thinking regarding the dynamics of transport within cities and this could be the most important benefit to society. Some people working in the centre of these cities may complain about inconvenience, but many would agree that this is a small price to pay.A reduction in the reliance of people on private vehicles is likely to encourage them to use public transport or even bicycles. Using public transport, especially the types that run on clean sources of power, will significantly raise air quality levels in cities, which will of course benefit everyone. The clean air could even further encourage the use of bicycles, which would in turn promote more healthy lifestyles and less obesity. This would contribute on an individual level to people’s well-being and a better and longer life, and on a societal level, it would lessen the strain on public health resources. Governments could encourage this by creating more bicycle lanes to make cycling easier and safer.In conclusion, it is clear that banning cars from the centre of cities is significantly beneficial. Better health and ecology, as well as improvement in longevity and well-being can benefit individuals and the entire society.;The restriction of cars in certain areas of cities, allowing only taxis and buses, is a development that has sparked intense debate. In my opinion, this is a positive development, as it has numerous benefits for both individuals and society. One of the primary motivations behind this strategy is to reduce pollution and promote the use of public transport. By banning cars from the centre of cities, the amount of exhaust fumes and emissions is significantly decreased, resulting in improved air quality and a healthier environment.This development has had various positive effects on individuals. For instance, pedestrians can now walk freely without the hazards and noise of heavy traffic, making cities more pleasant and safer to live in. Moreover, the reduction in traffic congestion means that buses and taxis can operate more efficiently, reducing travel times and making public transport a more viable option. This, in turn, encourages people to leave their private vehicles behind, leading to a decrease in traffic-related stress and an increase in physical activity as people opt to walk or cycle.The benefits to society are also substantial. By promoting public transport, cities can reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to a more sustainable future. Additionally, the reduction in traffic congestion can lead to increased productivity, as individuals spend less time commuting and more time engaging in economic activities. Examples of successful implementations of this strategy can be seen in cities such as Copenhagen and Barcelona, where pedestrianized zones have become hubs of activity, fostering community engagement and local business growth. In conclusion, the restriction of cars in city centres, allowing only taxis and buses, is a positive development that has far-reaching benefits for both individuals and society, and its continuation and expansion should be encouraged.
1332;Many countries are experiencing population growth and need to build more homes. Some say that new homes should be constructed in existing cities while others argue that new towns should be built to accommodate the growing population. What are the advantages and disadvantages of these points of view?;In the past two decades, there has been an exponential increase in the migration of people to different cities and countries, indirectly resulting in a considerable infrastructure development. However, there has been a long-standing debate on whether to direct these infrastructure projects to current cities or establish new counties. Careful consideration of both alternatives reveals that each has its positives and negatives.One of the major advantages of focusing on current cities for new construction is that it would benefit the residents of the cities in multiple ways. Tenants living in Vancouver would prefer to buy a newly constructed house in the city where they work rather than in a new town, to reduce their commute time. Moreover, the city has everything they desire such as efficient public transport, thriving job market and affordable healthcare. This would not be possible in new towns because of the time it takes to establish services and generate opportunities for people.On the other hand, accommodating people in houses built in newly created towns would put them in a pollution-free and clean environment. This is because new towns may take at least 10 years of time to become an attractive spot for people and industries alike. As a result, their exposure to harmful emissions from industrial plants and transportation is reduced, shielding them from the risks of acquiring health complications. A recent report released by the word Health Organization (WHO) suggests that the number of people affected by airborne infections is 20% higher in cities compared to new towns that were formed just a couple of years ago.In conclusion, while there are both positive and negative aspects to these views, the decision on where to build the new homes to accommodate increasing population will depend on many other factors as well. Therefore, a thorough assessment is required before starting an infrastructure project.;The issue of accommodating a growing population has sparked a long-standing debate on whether to direct infrastructure projects to current cities or establish new counties. While some argue that new homes should be constructed in existing cities, others contend that new towns should be built to house the increasing population. In this essay, we will delve into the advantages and disadvantages of these two perspectives.On the one hand, accommodating people in houses built in newly created towns would put them in a pollution-free and clean environment. This is a significant advantage, as it would provide residents with a healthier and more sustainable living space. New towns can be designed with green spaces, efficient transportation systems, and eco-friendly infrastructure, making them attractive options for those seeking a better quality of life. Additionally, new towns can be built with modern amenities and facilities, providing residents with access to cutting-edge technology and services.On the other hand, constructing new homes in existing cities has its own set of advantages. For instance, it would be more cost-effective, as the necessary infrastructure, such as roads, schools, and hospitals, is already in place. Moreover, existing cities often have established communities, cultural attractions, and economic opportunities, making them more appealing to potential residents. However, the downside of building in existing cities is the increased strain on resources, infrastructure, and services, which can lead to overcrowding, traffic congestion, and decreased quality of life.In conclusion, both perspectives have their merits and drawbacks. While building new towns offers a clean and modern environment, constructing new homes in existing cities provides access to established infrastructure and amenities. Ultimately, a balanced approach that takes into account the unique needs and circumstances of each region should be adopted, to ensure that the growing population is accommodated in a sustainable and equitable manner.
1327;Many people argue that museums and art galleries should present the nation’s art, as opposed to artworks from other countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The cultural value of engaging with museums and art galleries is unquestionable; they exert a great deal of influence on our perception of the world. It is only reasonable to ponder whether or not these outlets of culture should concentrate their efforts on presenting the nation’s own art, and not that of other countries. In my opinion, there should be an attempt to strike a balance and put the objects of national art in the spotlight, while allowing the public to get acquainted with foreign artworks to a certain extent.If people were to only find sculptures and paintings by national artists in their local museums, that would have a number of positive effects, such as the fame the artists of that country would gain and the pride its citizens would feel for their fellow countrymen. It would promote patriotism and strengthen the image of the country in the eyes of its inhabitants. Local artists would also receive more financial assistance from the government as their works would generate a significant amount of interest, potentially resulting in further development of the local art. However, in order to evolve art needs fresh ideas, and without exposure to a wider range of creativity the world provides, the evolution of local arts may be hindered.People enjoy art because it appeals to their inner sense of beauty and triggers strong emotions, and whether the masterpiece that causes these feelings belongs to a local or foreign artist is irrelevant. Talent knows no geographical boundaries; therefore, the emphasis should be on how much joy or amazement the work of art brings, rather than on its origin. If that principle were to be followed, we would never have to choose between local and international art. Reducing our museums or galleries’ collections to local art works, in my view, would be harmful and go against the democratic nature of art.To sum up, it seems to me that a country has nothing to lose by allowing its people to admire art created elsewhere in the world. A conscious choice by the government to support local artists while hosting exhibitions from other countries could prove the most beneficial.";The cultural value of engaging with museums and art galleries is unquestionable, as they provide a platform for people to learn about,s appreciate, and connect with the artistic heritage of various nations. However, this raises an important question: should these institutions prioritize showcasing the nation's own art, or should they also feature artworks from other countries? While some argue that museums and art galleries should focus solely on presenting the nation's art, I disagree with this perspective.It is only reasonable to ponder whether or not these outlets of culture should concentrate their efforts on presenting the nation's own art, and not that of other countries. On one hand, highlighting a nation's art can foster national pride, preserve cultural identity, and provide a sense of ownership and belonging among its citizens. On the other hand, featuring artworks from other countries can broaden visitors' cultural understanding,s encourage cross-cultural exchange, and promote global appreciation and empathy.By showcasing a diverse range of artworks from around the world, museums and art galleries can facilitate a more nuanced and multifaceted understanding of art history, styles, and techniques. This can also help to break down cultural barriers and promote international cooperation and mutual respect. Furthermore, in today's increasingly globalized world, it is essential for people to be exposed to different perspectives and artistic expressions, which can enrich their cultural knowledge and foster a more open-minded and tolerant society.In conclusion, while presenting a nation's art is important, I believe that museums and art galleries should not limit themselves to showcasing only national art. Instead, they should strive to create a balanced and diverse exhibition program that includes both national and international artworks, allowing visitors to appreciate and learn from the rich cultural heritage of various nations.
955;Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?;Numerous experts think that every country should be capable to produce more materials and commodities. I agree with this argument as it brings benefits to countries and I will highlight some of them.To begin with, manufacturing goods is essential to any country as it helps to build their economy. Increasing production power assist them to export more and it also makes them less dependent on other countries. For instance, China is one of the largest producers in the world in any goods which also makes them the largest exporter. Such development in production power contributes to their gross domestic product.Another reason is that extra produced goods can be used in emergencies, such emergencies are pandemics, financial crises and many more. By growing the production of goods and materials, a country will always be a reliable business partner. Thus, companies will reach out to them and become loyal partners. Moreover, countries should be aware that by increasing their production. For example, there is a semiconductor chip crisis is going on all over the world and no country in the world is able to meet the demands of chips. On the contrary, India is now planning to satisfy the demand for chips by strengthening its manufacturing capacity to a massive level while it will directly contribute to their economy and also generate job opportunities.To conclude, I agree that more in-house production is necessary. It is extremely crucial to produce more needed products in order to consistently outperform the rest of the world and also it brings many beneficial things like generating job opportunities and a rise in the Gross domestic product of a country.;The notion that the primary goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods is a widely debated topic. Many experts think that every country should be capable of producing more materials and commodities, and I agree with this argument. Constantly increasing production can bring numerous benefits to countries, and I will highlight some of them.To begin with, manufacturing goods is essential to any country as it helps to build their economy. A strong manufacturing sector can provide employment opportunities,,assistant's, income, and stimulate economic growth. When a country produces more, it can meet the demands of its citizens, reduce reliance on imports, and increase its exports, thereby earning foreign exchange. This, in turn, can improve the country's balance of payments and boost its international trade. Furthermore, increased production can lead to technological advancements, innovation, and research and development, which are crucial for a country's long-term sustainability and competitiveness.Moreover, producing more materials and goods can also enhance a country's self-sufficiency and resilience. By being able to produce its own goods, a country is less vulnerable to external factors such as global market fluctuations, trade wars, and supply chain disruptions. This can lead to greater stability and security, allowing the country to better respond to crises and challenges. Additionally, increased production can also contribute to improved living standards, as a wider range of goods and services become available to citizens, enhancing their overall quality of life.In conclusion, while there may be arguments against constantly increasing production, such as environmental concerns and resource depletion, I believe that the benefits of producing more materials and goods outweigh the drawbacks. By prioritizing production, countries can build strong economies, improve living standards, and enhance their international competitiveness, ultimately leading to a more prosperous and sustainable future.
1290;Many people believe that studying at university is the best way to develop oneself, learn new skills and find a well-paid job. Other people believe that more is learned from getting a job straight away after school and learning whilst working.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;There are many ways to learn new knowledge and skills. Traditional educational routes, such as school followed by college or university is one route that is generally accepted and respected by today’s society. It can be argued, however, that this is not always the best way. A more vocational route can be more appropriate for certain people and for particular jobs.Universities generally have deference given to them and, due to this, most schools tailor their programs to help students get university admission. Universities usually have respected and highly qualified teachers who have the knowledge and the skills to take their students to very high levels of knowledge and expertise. The very difficulty of gaining admission, getting through the duration of the course and passing final exams ensures to employers that graduates have the necessary self-discipline, intelligence and ability to get through the courses.Universities are also particularly well suited to the teaching of various subjects, for example, medicine, law and literature and these subjects need students’ full-time attention in order to do well. Although vocational experience is necessary, a certain grounding in basic concepts to a high-level is important. Once this knowledge has been acquired, students can then integrate their knowledge with practical understanding.This, however, is not the case for all areas of learning, especially ones where the quantity of high level knowledge is not required or is possible to be learned whilst working at the same time. Young people studying to be an electrician or a plumber are good examples. To do this work well requires a lot of experience, yet also a sound understanding of theory. The learning here can be and is done working and studying at the same time, often through apprenticeships and vocational courses involving significant amounts of work experience.Therefore, in my opinion, there are more ways than one to acquire a profession. Whether learning should take place at university alone or whilst working depends on the course and the end job.;The debate about whether studying at university or getting a job straight away after school is the best way to develop oneself has been ongoing for years. On one hand, many people believe that traditional educational routes, such as school followed by college or university, is one way that is generally accepted and respected by today's society. This route provides individuals with a solid foundation in their chosen field, as well as valuable skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication. For example, a person wishing to become a doctor or lawyer would undoubtedly need to attend university to gain the necessary qualifications and training.On the other hand, some people argue that a more vocational route can be more appropriate for certain people and for particular jobs. Learning whilst working can provide individuals with hands-on experience and practical skills that are essential for certain careers, such as plumbing, electrical work, or culinary arts. Additionally, this route can be more cost-effective and allow individuals to earn a salary whilst gaining experience. Whether learning should take place at university alone or whilst working depends on the course and the end job. For instance, someone who wants to become a software engineer may benefit from a university education, whereas someone who wants to become a carpenter may learn more from an apprenticeship.In my opinion, a combination of both university education and vocational training can be the most effective way to develop oneself. This approach allows individuals to gain a solid foundation in their chosen field, as well as practical skills and experience. Ultimately, the choice between university and vocational training depends on the individual's career goals, learning style, and personal preferences. By considering these factors and choosing the most suitable route, individuals can set themselves up for success and achieve their full potential.
1288;Many people in cities today live in high-rise apartment blocks. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this type of living?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;High-rise apartment blocks are a common sight in cities around the world. They are especially popular in large cities and in locations where building land is scarce. Living in such buildings has various advantages and disadvantages for town planners and the inhabitants themselves.The most significant advantage of high-rise apartment blocks is probably for the town planners. With land often being at a premium in large cities, one way to maximise space is to build upwards, so that the population density per square kilometre can be increased. The demand for housing in big cities can therefore be more easily met. There are also disadvantages for town planners. The heavier population density can put added pressure on social facilities, for example sewage and other waste disposal, and the provision of adequate school and medical services.There are also advantages and disadvantages for the actual inhabitants of high-rise apartment blocks. With the demand for housing being reduced, prices are therefore not as high, making housing more affordable. Many people also like not having to be responsible for a garden, and living in an apartment has this advantage. Finally, with so many people living in the same area, many friendships can be made and a community spirit can be built up. It appears the most significant disadvantage is that, in practice, living in high-rise apartment blocks is just not the lifestyle many people want. In some city neighbourhoods, these living spaces can often be associated with poor living conditions and undesirable social elements. In addition, many people view high-rise apartment blocks as being unsafe. For example, in the case of fire, tall buildings are difficult or impossible to evacuate safely.It is clear that high-rise apartment blocks have benefits and drawbacks. It is also clear, however, that due to the need to house increasing numbers of people in cities, these architectural features are here to stay, whether people like them or not.;The proliferation of high-rise apartment blocks in cities worldwide has become a ubiquitous phenomenon. These structures are particularly prevalent in large metropolises and areas where land for construction is limited. The advantages and disadvantages of residing in such buildings are multifaceted, affecting both town planners and the inhabitants themselves.On the one hand, the benefits of high-rise apartment blocks are numerous. For town planners, they offer a viable solution to the issue of scarce land, especially in densely populated urban areas. By building upwards, a larger number of residents can be accommodated without encroaching on valuable land that could be used for other purposes, such as parks or commercial spaces. Additionally, for inhabitants, high-rise apartments often provide unparalleled views of the cityscape and can be located in close proximity to central business districts, public transportation hubs, and other amenities, thereby enhancing the quality of life for residents.On the other hand, there are also significant drawbacks to living in high-rise apartment blocks. One of the primary concerns is the loss of community and privacy that can come with living in such close quarters to numerous strangers. Furthermore, security can become a pressing issue, with the potential for unauthorized access to the building and the apartments themselves. The dependence on elevators and other mechanical systems can also lead to issues when these systems fail, causing inconvenience to the residents. Lastly, the high density of these buildings can contribute to increased noise pollution and reduced natural lighting in apartments, negatively impacting the overall living environment.In conclusion, while high-rise apartment blocks are a common sight in cities around the world, especially in large cities and areas with limited building land, they present a mixed bag of advantages and disadvantages for both town planners and inhabitants. Careful planning and management are essential to mitigate the downsides and ensure that these structures contribute positively to the urban landscape and the lives of their residents.
789;Many people now undertake extreme activities, from hang-gliding to mountain climbing.Why do people risk their lives in this way, and do you think this is a good trend?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Extreme sports, such as mountain climbing and hand-gliding, have become increasingly popular over the past several decades. Now more than ever, athletes can be paid to do these activities full-time, encouraging more aspiring athletes to enter extreme sports. In addition, the addictive nature of these activities means that participants tend to stay in the sport for the thrill. While the increased popularity can result in more accidents, it can also make the sports safer as atheletes collectively learn from past mistakes.While people have undertaken extreme activities long before the advent of television and social media, these new platforms give extreme sports the much needed sponsorship and attention. Nowadays, outlandish and dangerous acts can be televised and monetized, giving the athletes a way to make a living out of these events. Therefore, more people would feel encouraged to participate in these activities knowing that they can have a decent income. On top of the external motivation, most extreme athletes take part in these sports because they are thrilling and addicting. These atheletes chase the rush and validation that they get when doing dangerous activities. As a result, even without the external rewards, some people would still partake in these sports.Given that people are motivated both internally and externally to participate in extreme sports, it is inevitable that these activities become more popular. While it is true that increased participation would result in more accidents, it would also create more lessons for future participants. In this way, these accidents and injuries would help educate future athletes on how to protect themselves. Moreoever, this increased popularity would also encourage governments to draft more safety regulations.In conclusion, given that it is human nature to want to achieve feats of strength and courage, extreme sports would always be attractive for some. Because of this, there will always be people injuring themselves while pursuing these feats. Therefore, these activities would become safer the more athletes learn from past incidents.;The rise of extreme sports, such as mountain climbing and hang-gliding, has become a notable trend over the past several decades. Many people are now drawn to these activities, which involve a high level of risk and physical exertion. But why do people risk their lives in this way? In my opinion, the attraction to extreme sports stems from human nature's inherent desire to achieve feats of strength and courage. Humans have always been driven to push their limits and challenge themselves, and extreme sports provide a platform to do just that.While the increased popularity of extreme sports can result in more accidents, it can also make the sports safer as athletes collectively learn from past mistakes. As more people participate in these activities, they share their experiences, and the sports community as a whole becomes more knowledgeable about safety protocols and best practices. For instance, advances in equipment technology and safety gear have significantly reduced the risk of injury in sports like mountain climbing. Furthermore, the collective knowledge and expertise gained from past experiences have led to the development of more effective safety measures, making the sports safer for participants.Given that it is human nature to want to achieve feats of strength and courage, extreme sports would always be attractive for some. I believe this trend is generally positive, as it promotes physical and mental well-being, as well as a sense of community and camaraderie among participants. Overall, while there are risks involved, the benefits of extreme sports, including the thrill of achievement and the pursuit of personal growth, make them an exciting and rewarding pursuit for those who dare to take on the challenge.
1345;Many people support animal testing while others believe it isn’t appropriate (discuss);Many people support use of animals for testing medicines for humans. Others believe it isn’t appropriate to use animals for such experiments. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayApproval of the medicines for human use is a tedious process which involves a series of tests often performed on animals. While some people support this idea because it makes drugs safer for human consumption, others believe that it is an unethical practice. Personally, I am in favour of the idea that medicines should be tested in all possible scenarios before being released to the public.Those against animal experimentation argue that animals have the same rights as human beings because they are the outcome of the same evolution process through which humans came into existence. Infecting them with viruses and exposing them to bacteria, to create a conducive environment to test a chemical substance may cause excruciating pain to these lab animals. Any failed test can mean that the subject either loses its precious life or suffers for the rest of its existence, and understandably, some people are against what they consider an immoral practice.Nonetheless, if a drug is released into the market without a thorough end-to-end testing, it could cause severe damage to anyone who may consume it. Every day a large number of animals are being mercilessly killed by humans for their mere flesh and skin. There isn’t a big difference between killing an animal for food and sacrificing its life for testing a chemical composition, because both actions are helping the human race to survive. What’s more, the life of one animal used to test a life-saving drug could help many people live. This is why a large number of people believe that testing drugs on animals is a matter of survival.To sum up, there are valid reasons why animal testing seems cruel and unacceptable to some, and crucial to others. In my opinion, even though animals subjected to testing may suffer, it is a necessary step to ensure the healing power of a drug.;The debate on animal testing has sparked intense discussion, with many people supporting the use of animals for testing medicines for humans, while others vehemently opposing it. On one hand, many people believe that animal testing is essential for advancing medical research and developing life-saving treatments. They argue that testing on animals helps to ensure the safety and efficacy of new medicines before they are administered to humans. This approach has led to numerous breakthroughs in medical science, including the development of vaccines and treatments for diseases such as cancer and HIV.On the other hand, there are those who believe that it isn't appropriate to use animals for such experiments. They argue that animal testing is cruel and inhumane, and that alternative methods, such as computer simulations and in vitro testing, can be just as effective. They also point out that animals and humans have different physiology and biology, which can lead to inaccurate results and unnecessary suffering. Moreover, many people believe that animals have rights and should not be used for human benefit, and that there are more ethical and compassionate ways to conduct medical research.In my opinion, animal testing is a necessary evil, but it should be carried out with caution and only when absolutely necessary. While I understand the concerns about animal welfare, I also acknowledge the significant contributions that animal testing has made to medical science. However, I believe that researchers should strive to use alternative methods whenever possible and treat animals with respect and care. Ultimately, a balanced approach that takes into account both human needs and animal welfare is the most ethical and responsible way forward. By doing so, we can ensure that medical research continues to advance while minimizing harm to animals.
327;Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. Do you agree or disagree?;It is undeniable that nowadays, smart devices such as phones and tablets play an essential role in one's life. Through countless websites and applications, people can connect with each other without any boundaries. While many people agree that the introduction of these technologies has many disadvantages to the conservative way of starting and maintaining relationships, I personally believe that they rather develop new socializing methods.First and foremost, social medias and applications can help with keeping in touch with acquintances. Previously, people had to follow a precise time and location to meet up with their friends as they are unable to contact the others to reschedule. However, the internet allows them to update their plans at any time. This means that if there is any emergency, an individual can immediately postpone the upcoming event and find the next available slot to continue the plan. Furthermore, there are several applications that allow people to video call their friends and family who are currently living apart.The current technologies not only offer us options to communicate with our current contacts but also allow us to discover new friends. In the past, it is difficult to find people with a common interest which had to be done through social events. Nowadays, online communities enable their users to connect with new friends virtually. Thus, fewer individuals are left alone, especially introverts and those who are living in remote areas which can have difficulties socializing offline.All in all, despite the fact that there are many positive impacts of the invention of social medias and communication technologies, there are also risks and downsides of using them without face-to-face communication. Therefore, the time used for socializing online and offline should always be balanced.;The advent of modern communication technology has revolutionized the way we interact with each other,s and its impact on social relationships has been a subject of debate. While some people believe that it has negative effects, I disagree and argue that modern communication technology has numerous benefits for social relationships.On one hand, social medias and applications can help with keeping in touch with acquaintances who we might otherwise lose contact with. These platforms enable us to maintain a connection with people from our past, such as old school friends or colleagues, and stay updated about their lives. Moreover, there are several applications that allow people to video call their friends and family who are currently living apart, which helps to bridge the distance and foster closer relationships.On the other hand, the current technologies not only offer us options to communicate with our current contacts but also allow us to discover new friends. Social media platforms and online communities provide opportunities to meet like-minded people and expand our social circles. This can be particularly beneficial for individuals who are shy or have difficulty meeting new people in person. Furthermore, online relationships can often transcend geographical boundaries, enabling people to connect with others from diverse backgrounds and cultures.In conclusion, the benefits of modern communication technology for social relationships far outweigh the drawbacks. By utilizing social media, video calling applications, and online communities, we can maintain existing relationships, form new connections, and expand our social networks. As such, I firmly believe that modern communication technology has a positive impact on social relationships, and its continued evolution will only serve to enhance our ability to connect with others.
837;Many people today, especially in the developed world, are choosing to have fewer children, or none at all.Why is this happening, and do you think it is a good trend?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Weather to have children or not is one of the most important questions young adults have to ask themselfs nowadays. Overpopulation is one of the many global problems next to climate change, and poverty.In my opinion, the need to have children roots back to us being nothing more, but civilised animals. Animals have one goal above all; reproduce. This is why in many cultures, men and women who cannot have chlidren are seen as disabled, or sick. Nowadays, modern values changed our perspective, having children is often seen as a necessity for a happy, and successful life.It is important to recognise the problems the developed world faces. There is smoke in the air, plastic pollution everywhere, poverty in third world countries, and many other factors that make Earth a terrible place for many. Above all, the life we give birth to will have to eat, drink, and consume just like everyone else, using more and more of the already limited resources, generating more and more trash.Many people argue that the above mentioned points are a pessimistic and unrealistic. Humans have to reproduce, to keep the species from extintion. And truthfully the only way to do that, is to give birth as many kids as possible. This issue lies deep in our society; here in Hungary, a family is rewared almost 30000 USD if they have 3 or more kids. This means that many people have children because they get money for it, and they are also seen socially accepted.I believe modern day intelligence goes further than IQ points and money earned. We have to recognise the problems created, overpopulation being one of them. While I do not believe that we should not have kids, I think there should be careful planning involved and self-reflection before giving birth to new life.";The trend of having fewer children or none at all is becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly in developed countries. One of the primary reasons for this shift is the growing awareness of global problems such as overpopulation, climate change, and poverty. Overpopulation, in particular, poses a significant threat to the planet's resources and sustainability. By choosing to have smaller families, individuals are contributing to a more manageable population size, which can help alleviate some of the pressure on the environment and resources.However, it is interesting to note that in some countries, families are incentivized to have more children. For instance, a family can receive almost $30,000 if they have three or more kids. This financial reward can be a significant motivator for some individuals, who may choose to have children primarily for the economic benefits. Furthermore, social acceptance also plays a role, as having multiple children is often viewed as a desirable and respectable choice.In my opinion, the trend of having fewer children is a good one, as it can help mitigate the issues of overpopulation and resource depletion. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that the reasons behind this trend are complex and multifaceted. While some individuals may choose to have smaller families for environmental or personal reasons, others may be driven by financial incentives or social expectations. Ultimately, it is crucial to prioritize education and awareness about the importance of sustainable population growth, rather than solely relying on financial rewards or social norms to dictate family planning decisions. By doing so, we can work towards creating a more balanced and sustainable future for generations to come.
1317;Many people try to achieve a work-life balance but fail. Why is this happening? What can be done to help people overcome this problem?;Many people strive to achieve a work-life balance, but often find themselves failing despite their best efforts. This is not surprising, as balancing work and life commitments can be extremely difficult due to both having their unique stressors.One of the major reasons why so many people struggle to achieve harmony between their personal and professional lives is that now it is easier than ever for people to stay connected outside of regular work hours. This has led to an expectation that employees should always be available, and they risk being seen as unreliable or uncommitted if they are not. A knock-on effect of longer working hours is that little time is left for leisure activities such as socialising or engaging in hobbies or sports, which help reduce stress levels and improve overall well-being. This type of pressure and lack of free time can lead to feelings of burnout, with no respite from life’s pressures, resulting in chronic fatigue and diminished motivation over time.Helping those struggling to find a suitable work-life balance will require joint efforts of managers and employees. Workers, for instance, need to recognise the importance of taking regular breaks throughout the day and getting enough sleep each night, while employers should consider being more flexible when it comes to allowing staff to work remotely and offering paid vacation days. This will give employees space, both mentally and physically, enabling them to better manage their commitments without overextending themselves.In conclusion, achieving a successful work-life balance is something that many cannot quite reach due to external pressures from employers and a lack of downtime. However, these issues can be overcome, if we create realistic boundaries between our professional lives and personal goals, and make conscious decisions about how we want to spend our time.;"Many people strive to achieve a work-life balance, but often find themselves failing despite their best efforts. This is a widespread problem that affects individuals from all walks of life. Balancing work and life commitments can be extremely difficult due to both having their unique stressors. On the one hand, work demands long hours, tight deadlines, and high expectations, leading to physical and mental exhaustion. On the other hand, life commitments such as family, social relationships, and personal responsibilities also require time, energy, and attention.As a result, many individuals find themselves torn between their professional and personal obligations, leading to a sense of guilt, anxiety, and burnout. The blurred lines between work and personal life, exacerbated by technology, make it even harder to disconnect from work-related tasks and responsibilities. Furthermore, societal pressure to be constantly available and responsive can create an unrealistic expectation of being always ""on"" and available.To overcome this problem, individuals, organizations, and societies must work together to create a culture that values and supports work-life balance. Employers can start by implementing flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or compressed workweeks, to allow employees to better manage their time. Additionally, encouraging employees to take breaks, and use their paid time off can help reduce burnout and increase productivity. Individuals can also prioritize self-care, set boundaries, and learn to say ""no"" to non-essential work-related tasks. By recognizing the importance of work-life balance and taking collective action, we can help people achieve a healthier and more sustainable balance between their professional and personal lives. Ultimately, achieving a work-life balance is crucial for maintaining physical and mental well-being, and it is essential that we make a conscious effort to prioritize it."
1298;Many schoolchildren today take part in work experience sessions for short periods of time instead of attending school. Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It has been a popular trend for some time now to put children into what can be called ‘work experience placements’. The children are taken out of school and take part in various types of work, usually for around a week. Some people criticise this trend, but I can’t see how it can be a negative experience.One of the criticisms is that children lose a week of schoolwork. With the pressure to do well at school increasing, children need every bit of help to maximise their potential. Taking them out of the school, it is therefore argued, stops them from getting access to needed education for a whole week. As the students won’t really be of much help to a workplace for just one week, it would therefore be better for them to remain at school.While this is a valid point, taking a child’s entire experience of school into account, a single week away does not make a significant difference. Indeed, if the timing of the week’s work placements is done correctly, the week can also serve as a kind of ‘holiday’ away from school, something that is regularly needed in order to allow students to remain fresh and enthusiastic. In many work placements, children also get to see some of things they learn at school put into a realistic context, allowing them to understand the relevance of what they learn and thereby creating a way to reinforce the learning.In addition to this, schoolchildren can be quite nervous about the world of work that they will have to join at some point in their lives. By getting this short taste of what it is like, they can see that it is nothing to be scared about. As well as this, children will often have some ideas of what they want to do for a living, but are not sure. By allowing them to see a type of work they are considering, they are better able to decide whether that career could be suitable for them.I feel, therefore, that work placements can be seen as a positive development. Missing a short amount of school is not serious and the benefits that can be gained from the placements are significant.;The trend of schoolchildren participating in work experience sessions for short periods of time, instead of attending school, has sparked a debate about its impact on their education. While some people criticise this trend for taking children out of school for a week, I firmly believe that it is a positive development. In my opinion, I can't see how it can be seen as a negative experience. A single week away from school does not make a significant difference to a child's education.On the contrary, work experience sessions provide students with invaluable opportunities to gain practical skills, explore different career paths, and develop essential life skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. These experiences can be incredibly enriching, allowing students to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world settings and gain a deeper understanding of the industry they are interested in. Moreover, the break from the monotony of daily school routine can be refreshing, helping students to recharge and return to their studies with renewed enthusiasm and motivation.Furthermore, work experience sessions can also help students to make informed decisions about their future careers, which can lead to a more focused and purposeful approach to their studies. By exposing students to various professions and work environments, they can gain a better understanding of what each career entails, and make more informed decisions about their future pathways. Overall, I strongly believe that work experience sessions are a positive development, offering students a unique chance to learn, grow, and develop in a way that complements their traditional education.
1413;Millions of people every year move to English- speaking countries such as Australia, Britain or America, in order to study at school, college or university.

This essay will describe in detail why English is an important international language.Firstly, the English language is widely used in many countries and at present, the world traders are currently developing rapidly. In order to compete with people from different countries, it is to be able to communicate the English language. For example, China has been improving a lot in many sectors. They are able to compete with other countries because many people in China English language and they are trying hard to study English.Secondly, many companies prefer to employ people who can speak English because if the companies create new in different countries, the employers are able to move the new branch without new people and the branch company is still able to communicate with the central company. In fact, one of the largest companies in the world (Google) has created some in different countries and each of the Google is able to discuss things or otherwise communicate even though they are in different countries because they all use English to communicate.In conclusion, many people move to English speaking countries for further studies because they believe that it will improve their English skills and in order to become a successful person in the future, mastering English is .;The world has become a global village, and the demand for studying in English-speaking countries has skyrocketed. Every year, millions of people migrate to countries like Australia, Britain, or America to pursue their educational goals at schools, colleges, or universities. The primary reason behind this phenomenon is the significance of English as an international language. English has become the lingua franca, bridging cultural and geographical divides, and enabling communication across the globe.Many people prefer to study in an English-speaking country because it provides them with a competitive edge in the job market. English is the language of international business, science, technology, and diplomacy. Companies operating globally prefer to employ individuals who can communicate effectively in English, as it facilitates seamless interaction with the central company and its subsidiaries in different countries.

It also provides them with opportunities to interact with people from various cultural backgrounds, broadening their perspectives and fostering global understanding. As a result, students who study in English-speaking countries acquire not only academic knowledge but also valuable language skills, cultural competence, and a network of international contacts. In conclusion, the importance of English as an international language drives millions of people to study in English-speaking countries, where they can gain a competitive advantage, access world-class education, and unlock global career opportunities.
795;Missions to explore space are hugely expensive, and there are problems on Earth which demand attention. The number of these missions needs to be reduced.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is supposed by many, that high-cost space studies should be cut off while more focus should be paid to the challenges mankind face on Earth. This essay completely disargees with such view because of two reasons that will de developed further.The first reason is that only rich countries spend thier budgets for space studies. This means that only when states have resolved most of their problems with poverty, level of medicine treatment, safety, they can divert some of the funds to invest in future technologies. Moreover, citizens will go on a strike and make the govenment to deal with real life problems instead of dreaming about the space. For example, not more than 5% of USA GDP is spent on space programs that is sufficient to progress, construct new sputniks, and send astronauts to the Internations Space Station.The second argument supposes that many space technologies have a dual puropose. In other words, being initially developed for studing the space, they were adopted to make people's day-to-day life easier. For example, mobile phones and the mobile Internet, navigaion using GPS would not be possibe if people were not trying to explore space.In conclusion, new technologies are developed when people are trying to learn the world outside our planet. This;I completely disagree with the view that the number of space exploration missions needs to be reduced due to their high expenses and existing problems on Earth. There are two primary reasons that justify the continuation of these missions, and the first reason is that only rich countries allocate a significant portion of their budgets to space studies. This implies that these nations have already resolved most of their pressing issues, such as poverty, medicine, treatment, and safety, to a satisfactory extent. When a country has achieved a certain level of economic stability and social welfare, it is then capable of diverting some of its funds to invest in future technologies, including space exploration.For instance, countries like the United States, China, and those in Europe have made significant strides in space research, and their investments have led to numerous breakthroughs that have improved daily life on Earth. Space exploration has led to the development of technologies such as GPS, telecommunications, and weather forecasting, which have become integral to our daily lives. These advancements would not have been possible without substantial investment in space research. Therefore, reducing the number of space missions would be counterproductive, as it would hinder the potential for further innovation and improvement in living standards. The second reason, which will be developed further, emphasizes the long-term benefits and discoveries that space exploration brings, which outweigh the costs and justify continued investment in this field.

I strongly agree that modern medicine plays a crucial role in helping people live a longer life. Modern medicine relies heavily on new technology, which has enabled medical professionals to diagnose and treat diseases more effectively. With the help of advanced equipment and techniques, such as MRI scans, X-rays, and genetic testing, doctors can now identify diseases at a very early stage, which greatly improves the chances of successful treatment.Moreover, modern medicine has made tremendous progress in preventing and managing previously incurable diseases. Thanks to continuous research and development, medical science has discovered new treatments and medications that can cure or manage diseases that were once considered fatal. For instance, diseases like cancer, HIV, and tuberculosis can now be managed and treated with advanced medications and therapies. Doctors can now prescribe suitable medicines to patients, which not only improves their quality of life but also increases their lifespan.It's also interesting to note that intelligent people who have access to modern medicine tend to live longer lives. This is because they are more likely to follow a healthy lifestyle, adhere to medical advice, and take advantage of preventative measures such as vaccinations and regular check-ups. Furthermore, the increasing old population in many countries is a testament to the success of modern medicine. As people live longer, the proportion of elderly people in the population increases, which puts less strain on the healthcare system and allows for more focused care for the aging population.In conclusion, modern medicine is very important for living a long life, and its impact on increasing human lifespan cannot be overstated. With its emphasis on new technology, early disease detection, and effective treatment, modern medicine has made significant strides in helping people live longer, healthier lives. As medical science continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more impressive advances in the field, leading to further increases in human lifespan.
1315;More and more people today are drinking sugar-based drinks. Why is this happening? What measures can be taken to reverse this trend?;An alarming number of people today consume sugar-based drinks, whether it is in the form of soda, energy drinks or fruit drinks. Often consumers are lured by their widespread availability and convenience, however, marketing campaigns also play a role, targeting young people and giving them the perception that sugary drinks are not as unhealthy as they actually are.The availability of these types of drinks has greatly increased over time. They can now be found in almost any store or restaurant, which makes them easily accessible to almost anyone. The fact that they are often cheaper than alternatives, such as water or freshly squeezed juice, makes them an especially attractive option for those on a budget. Marketing campaigns for sugary beverages have been quite successful in creating positive associations attached to these products through advertisements on TV and billboards. This encourages people to consider them fun rather than unhealthy and normalises them within society.Luckily, reversing the rise in popularity of sugary drinks is still possible, if we act now and attack the problem from different angles. One of the very first steps should be educating people on the health risks associated with high sugar intake so that they can make better-informed decisions when selecting what type of beverage they consume. Companies should also be held accountable by law for their misleading marketing campaigns aimed at children and teenagers who are more likely to believe the false claims about their products’ health benefits without fully understanding what’s being sold to them. Schools, colleges and universities, and any institutions catering for young people, should consider banning sugary drinks and replacing them with refreshing alternatives without added sugar.Overall, it is important that we recognise the potential health risks posed by consuming too much sugar from soft drinks and take actionable steps towards reversing this trend in order to ensure our long-term wellbeing. Through greater education, government regulation, and increased corporate responsibility we can ensure that more people understand why reducing their intake of sugary beverages is important while still allowing them to access enjoyable yet healthier options.;The increasing consumption of sugar-based drinks has become a pressing concern in today's society. One of the primary reasons for this trend is the successful marketing campaigns launched by sugary drink manufacturers. These campaigns have created positive associations with these products, making them seem fun and appealing, rather than highlighting their unhealthy consequences. As a result, people, especially the younger generation, are encouraged to consider sugary drinks as a normal and enjoyable part of their daily lives, rather than a potentially harmful habit.The normalisation of sugary drinks within society has contributed significantly to their rising popularity. People are no longer aware of the negative impacts of excessive sugar consumption, such as obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay. Instead, they are swayed by the attractive packaging, enticing flavors, and clever advertising that sugary drink companies use to promote their products. To reverse this trend, it is essential to attack the problem from different angles. Governments, businesses, and individuals must work together to raise awareness about the health risks associated with sugary drinks and promote healthier alternatives.Reversing the rise in popularity of sugar-based drinks is still possible, if we act now. This can be achieved through education campaigns, stricter regulations on advertising, and the promotion of healthier drink options. Additionally, manufacturers can be encouraged to reduce the sugar content in their products and offer more low-sugar or sugar-free alternatives. By taking a multi-faceted approach, we can hope to create a societal shift away from sugary drinks and towards a healthier, more informed lifestyle. It is crucial that we take immediate action to address this issue, as the long-term consequences of inaction could be devastating for public health.
1259;More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Over the past decades, it has been registered a considerable decrease in the percentage of people eager to create a family at a young age. There could be different reasons for this and I am going to state them clearly in the following paragraphs, which will also explain why I believe the advantages of this situation far outweigh the disadvantages.Apparently, the society we currently live in has undergone substantial changes over the years, sometimes without us even noticing it. The most evident of these variations has probably been the gradual rise in the number of old people as opposed to the dramatic fall in the number of births. In fact, owing to the decline of the economy of most nations and the subsequent reduction of work opportunities, more and more people are giving up on the idea of becoming parents in their 20s or 30s. Many people see this as a negative aspect for our society; however, I have to strongly disagree with their opinion.The drawbacks to which a lot of people point out when discussing about these kind of topics often has to do with the age gap between parents and their children. Admittedly, someone cannot decide to have a child in their 40s without considering the significant generation gap that would separate them from their kids and, as a result, the issues of miscommunication that could arise.However, the disadvantages become of secondary importance as soon as the much more remarkable benefits are examined. First of all, older parents also means more responsible and mature caretakers; consequently, due to their broader life experience, they would arguably make better advisors for their kids. Not to mention that older parents would not only have more stable and secure jobs, but they would also have more consistent savings to devote to their children's further education, which in turn could help the latter having a better and well-paid job in the future.To conclude, although it's impossible not to take into account the drawbacks of having a child at a more advanced age, the advantages still outrun the disadvantages. Thus, children would be the first to benefit from such a situation.";"In recent years, there has been a noticeable shift in the age at which people are choosing to have children. Unlike in the past, more individuals are opting to become parents later in life. This trend can be attributed to various factors, with one significant reason being the decline of the economy. Owing to the decline of the economy, more and more people are giving up on the idea of becoming parents in their 20s or 30s, as they prioritize financial stability and security before taking on the responsibilities of parenthood.Many people see this as a negative aspect for our society; however, I have to strongly disagree with their opinion. In my view, the advantages of having children later in life far outweigh the disadvantages. One of the primary benefits is that older parents often mean more responsible and mature caretakers. With age comes wisdom, emotional stability, and a deeper understanding of life, all of which are essential qualities for effective parenting. Older parents are likely to be more financially secure, which enables them to provide better for their children's needs, including education and healthcare.Furthermore, older parents tend to have established careers and a stronger sense of self, allowing them to offer a more stable and secure environment for their children to grow and develop. This stability is crucial for the emotional and psychological development of children, providing them with a solid foundation to thrive in life. While some may argue that older parents might not have the same energy levels as younger parents, the maturity and life experience they bring to parenting can more than compensate for this. In conclusion, the trend of having children later in life is not a negative aspect of society, but rather a positive shift towards more responsible, mature, and capable parenting."
1425;Most high level positions in companies are filled by men, even though the workforce in many developed countries consists of 50 percent female workers. Companies should be required to allocate a certain percentage of management positions to women. Discuss, what is your opinion?;"The inequality between men and women has always been a significant issue in society. , it is undeniable that most vital positions in companies are taken by males, not females. Therefore, that companies should allocate to women a certain number of these positions. However, I do not agree with this requirement completely.In some feudal countries, it was true to say that the society the males, and at that time instances of inequality occurred very frequently. Up until the present moment, it in some developing countries; also it is greatly . A large number of women in these countries are not allowed to go to work or even go to . In this case, this is not an individual issue, but social problem. The governments should have some solution to this tendency, and at the same time they should promulgate a new legislation to protect women’s .On the other hand, the global economy is developing rapidly nowadays. In most corporations, distinguish men from women; they only focus on working efficiently. In this world, any employees who possess enough abilities and work in an effective way, be promoted to positions. Therefore, allocating the high level positions in companies to women is not necessary. Moreover, the instances of women in essential positions . Those women are very successful in their work and their lives.In conclusion, although the inequality between men and women has reduced, it still is a social issue worth . Personally, in my opinion we should create as many opportunities for women to have an equal life as we can.";The inequality between men and women has always been a significant issue in society, with various aspects of life being affected, including the workplace. It is a well-documented fact that most vital positions in companies are taken by males, not females, despite the fact that the workforce in many developed countries consists of 50 percent female workers. This has led to a proposal that companies should allocate to women a certain number of these high-level positions. However, I do not agree with this requirement completely.On one hand, allocating a certain percentage of management positions to women could help to address the existing gender imbalance in the corporate world. This would provide women with more opportunities to climb the career ladder and break through the glass ceiling that has held them back for so long. Moreover, it could also bring diverse perspectives and ideas to the management teams, which could be beneficial for the companies.On the other hand, imposing a quota system could be counterproductive and may lead to less qualified women being promoted to high-level positions simply to meet the quota. This could undermine the credibility of female leaders and create resentment among male colleagues. Furthermore, it could also limit opportunities for women who are truly deserving of promotions, as they may be viewed as having been promoted solely due to the quota system.In conclusion, while the idea of allocating a certain percentage of management positions to women is well-intentioned, I believe that it is not the best solution to address the gender inequality in the workplace. Instead, companies should focus on creating a fair and inclusive work environment that provides equal opportunities for both men and women to succeed, based on their skills and qualifications. This approach would be more effective in promoting gender equality and would ultimately benefit both the companies and their employees.
1390;News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in a newspaper. What factors do you think influence their decisions? Do we become used to bad news? Would it be better if more good news was reported?;. There are two factors that influence their decisions. The first is the kind of customers they aim at. each kind of readers and watchers has its own features. For example, if your customers are almost entirely teenagers, you have to concentrate on something attracting them such as stories, photographs of singer stars, film stars, funny tales, and fashion. It be very silly if you to provide teenagers with economic or news. On the contrary, and politicians may never read news about James Blunt or Keira Knightley. Therefore, what influences news editors’ decisions the most is the taste of their customers.The second factor is how hot and attractive the news is. Who or watch news from a year or a month ago or even about something that happened last week? The answer is . In the energetic and competitive world nowadays, people always ask for a really news. So that to satisfy customers, there is a pressure on all editors to find continually what has already happened not only yesterday but even an hour ago. Or else, they may lose their customers. None of editors wants that bleak future.The type of news is also an important consideration. Whether on television or in newspapers, we seem to get more of and become used to bad news. It is harder for us to come across a piece of good news. We can’t deny that bad things happen on Earth day by day. However, news editors try to gain more and more , which means more and more money, using bad news as a magnet. bad news makes us curious. We want to know why it is bad, what it is about, whether it influences us or not. As a result, we will buy newspapers or watch television to find out. And the happiest people are, of course, news editors.In my view it would be better if more good news reported. Bad news makes us good news makes us happy. There should an an equal amount of good and bad news. In that way we can give something bad a lot of thought while still being happy about the good news. Any inequalities between good news and bad news should be avoided. Nowadays we cannot live without news, and for that reason the role of news editors became very important. We should support them, and in turn they should try their best to provide us with useful news, both good and bad.;The role of news editors is crucial in shaping the content of television broadcasts and newspaper publications. Their decisions on what to feature are influenced by a variety of factors, with financial gain being a significant one. News editors try to gain more and more money, and they often use bad news as a magnet to attract a larger audience. The idea is that bad news sells, and by broadcasting or printing sensational and often disturbing stories, they can increase their ratings and circulation, thereby generating more revenue.In my view, however, it would be better if more good news was reported. Bad news dominates the headlines, making us curious and eager to know more. We want to know why it is bad, what it is about, and whether it influences us or not. This constant exposure to negative news can have a desensitizing effect, making us become used to bad news and even expecting it. As a result, we may start to overlook the positive aspects of our lives and the world around us.Reporting more good news would provide a more balanced view of the world and could have a positive impact on society. It could inspire people, promote a sense of community, and highlight the good deeds and achievements of individuals and organizations. Furthermore, good news can motivate people to make a positive difference in their own lives and in the lives of others. By shifting the focus towards more positive stories, news editors can contribute to creating a more optimistic and hopeful atmosphere, which would be beneficial for individuals and society as a whole. Ultimately, a more balanced approach to news reporting, including a greater emphasis on good news, would be a welcome change.
1321;Newspapers have a significant influence on people’s ideas and opinions. Why is this happening? Is it a positive or negative situation?;Many people believe that newspapers play a pivotal role in shaping the way we think. There are numerous ways in which this affects our society, and I believe that this influence is mostly negative.Newspapers have long been a source of valuable information that has kept societies abreast of the latest happenings in the world. Since the average citizen has minimal knowledge about the information in expert analysis articles, well-established newspapers are powerfully poised to form public opinion through attention-grabbing images and carefully worded commentary. This leaves the reader no choice but to trust the accuracy of what they have read.Sadly, unbiased objectivity, which used to be the core idea behind journalism, seems to be a thing of the past. The arrival and spread of social media platforms has caused a gradual decline in print media subscriptions and their circulation, since readers tend to favor the internet and social media to stay informed about current affairs. This gave rise to a worrying trend of newspapers using sensationalist and controversial tactics to improve their sales. As a result, the constant barrage of bad news has led to a society that sees itself as more vulnerable and powerless than ever. To make matters worse, there are plenty of well-documented instances where newspapers have been used to spread false propaganda which is usually politically motivated.All in all, although newspapers are our lifeline to the world around us, the recent trend of publishing misinformation has had a mostly negative impact on readers. It is my hope that newspapers will go back to publishing impartial accounts of the latest news in the future.;Newspapers have long been a source of valuable information that has kept societies abreast of the latest happenings in the world. They have played a pivotal role in shaping public opinion and influencing people's ideas on various issues. The significant influence of newspapers on people's ideas and opinions can be attributed to their widespread reach and the trust that readers have in them. Historically, newspapers were guided by the principle of unbiased objectivity, which used to be the core idea behind journalism, aiming to present facts without taking a biased stance.However, this unbiased objectivity, seems to be a thing of the past, as many newspapers now lean towards sensationalism and biased reporting to increase their readership and viewership. This shift has significant implications, as it can lead to the manipulation of public opinion and the spread of misinformation. The influence of newspapers can thus be seen as a double-edged sword. On the one hand, they have the power to educate and inform the public about important issues, helping to foster a more engaged and enlightened citizenry. On the other hand, when they abandon their commitment to objective reporting, they can contribute to the polarization of society and the erosion of trust in institutions.In conclusion, the influence of newspapers on people's ideas and opinions is a complex phenomenon. While they have the potential to positively impact society by providing accurate and unbiased information, their increasing tendency to abandon objectivity in favor of sensationalism and bias is a negative development. It is essential for newspapers to reclaim their role as guardians of factual reporting and for readers to be critical in their consumption of news to ensure that the influence of newspapers remains a positive force in shaping public discourse.
1391;Nowadays environmental problems are too big to be managed by individual persons or individual countries. In other words, it is an international problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;An essential problem of the 21st century is world pollution. Currently the environment is so contaminated that urgent measures should be taken. A single individual cannot be blamed for the world pollution, however every person should take care of his or her habitat. In addition, it is vital that environmental issues are treated internationally.Lately, many presentations, conferences and international summits are held to deal with waste treatment, recycling, and soil and water contamination. joint efforts and consolidation can only help in the mutual war the ongoing environmental disaster. For instance, governments should offer support to companies and organizations, involved in manufacturing, industry or agriculture in order to find environment-friendly approaches. These could be special law regulations, recycling programs, helping courses in order to implement ISO certificates and many more.However, the influence of individuals over environment should not be ignored. If we do not that our planet is our home, we will never be able to take care of it. We have to contribute every day to the preservation of nature and environment. For example, always remember to save energy by switching off lamps, computers and everything that we do not use. Our next obligation is to separate waste and throw bulk only in the designated areas. Driving vehicles can also be environment friendly. For example, we have to avoid accelerating the engines too rapidly or using the air conditioning in the country, where it would be better to save energy and simply open the windows.To sum up, environmental problems should be handled by local and international authorities as well as individuals. Every single person should take care of the environment, moreover we have to bring up our children to be conscious citizens of a clean and preserved planet.;The statement that environmental problems are too big to be managed by individual persons or individual countries is a notion that resonates deeply in today's world. I agree with this statement to a large extent, as the scope and complexity of these issues indeed transcend national borders and individual capabilities. One of the most pressing environmental concerns of the 21st century is world pollution, which encompasses air, water, and soil contamination, affecting ecosystems and human health globally.A single individual cannot be blamed for the world pollution, as it is a collective outcome of industrial activities, consumption patterns, and waste management practices of societies worldwide. The scale of pollution is such that it requires a concerted effort from governments, corporations, and the global community to address and mitigate its effects. For instance, climate change, a significant aspect of environmental degradation, is influenced by carbon emissions from industries and vehicles, which no single person can control or resolve independently.However, every person should take care of their habitat, contributing to the larger goal of environmental conservation. Individual actions, such as reducing plastic use, conserving water, and supporting renewable energy, may seem insignificant in isolation but collectively, they can lead to substantial positive change. Moreover, individual awareness and action can influence community practices, push for policy changes, and support businesses that adopt sustainable practices. Therefore, while the management of environmental problems may be beyond the capacity of individual persons or countries, the contribution of every individual towards protecting their environment is indispensable. In conclusion, addressing environmental problems, including world pollution, requires an international and collective approach, but the role of individual responsibility and action is crucial in this endeavor.
1368;Nowadays families move to different countries for work and some think it has a negative effect on children (agree/disagree);Nowadays families move to different countries for work. Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Recent advancements, in technology and transportation in particular, are reshaping our world in an unprecedented manner. Nowadays, it is not unusual for people to work abroad. Most expatriates relocate their families to the countries . Some people argue that this phenomenon negatively affects children, however, I agree with those who believe the opposite is true.Those who think that relocating children to a new place is undesirable do so for many reasons. Their most common argument is the negative impact of moving on a child’s personality. There is no doubt that living in a different community comes with its challenges, especially to young people, as they get exposed to behaviours, actions and customs they might not be familiar with. As a result, children could possibly feel a lack of stability and some confusion. It is also likely that their patriotic feelings and sense of belonging to their home country could weaken as they would miss many opportunities to celebrate their national events.Nevertheless, I firmly believe that opinion to be ludicrous, as it seems that getting exposed to a new culture is beneficial in many ways. It fosters young social and emotional capabilities. Moreover, children living abroad have better opportunities to and practice new languages. Mastering more than one language improves not only their intellectual development, but also their opportunities in acquiring better jobs in the future. According to a recent study published by the University of Chicago, competency in more than one language increases employment chances on average by 200%.In conclusion, I strongly believe that living in a different country positively affects children in all aspects. Acquiring new languages, and an open minded and tolerant personality are just few examples of the many possible benefits.This essay presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt. The writer’s ideas are relevant and well‐supported. The arrangement of information and use of cohesive devices are fine, perhaps with a slight overuse in the second body paragraph. Sentence structures are complex, and the vocabulary is varied and appropriately used, except for some minor grammatical/spelling mistakes. This essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;The modern world has become increasingly interconnected, with many families relocating to different countries for work opportunities. Most expatriates relocate their families to the countries they work in, resulting in a growing number of children growing up in foreign environments. Some people argue that this phenomenon negatively affects children, exposing them to unfamiliar cultures, languages, and social norms. However, I agree with those who believe the opposite is true.Living in a different country can have a profoundly positive impact on children, fostering young social and emotional capabilities. As they navigate new cultural contexts, they develop essential life skills such as adaptability, resilience, and open-mindedness. Moreover, acquiring new languages can have a significant impact on their future prospects. Studies have shown that bilingual individuals have improved employment chances, with their job prospects increasing on average by 200%. This is because speaking multiple languages enhances cognitive abilities, making them more attractive to potential employers.Furthermore, growing up in a foreign country can broaden children's perspectives, encouraging them to think critically and creatively. They learn to appreciate different customs, traditions, and ways of life, becoming more empathetic and tolerant individuals. As they interact with people from diverse backgrounds, they develop a unique understanding of the world, preparing them for an increasingly globalized society. In conclusion, I firmly believe that relocating to a different country can have a positive effect on children, equipping them with valuable skills, knowledge, and experiences that will benefit them throughout their lives.
1316;Nowadays many teenagers have a celebrity who they follow as a role model. Some people think this is not a good idea, because celebrities often set a bad example. Do you agree or disagree?;It is not uncommon for teenagers to worship celebrities. From singers to actors, many young people around the world look up to these stars and attempt to emulate their lifestyles. In my opinion, allowing children to idolize celebrities can often be detrimental, as they frequently set a poor example.Many of today’s celebrities tend to lack moral values, and they promote behaviour inappropriate for young people. For instance, some music videos feature explicit lyrics glorifying drug use and violence. In addition, the media often reports on celebrities who indulge in excessive partying or drinking alcohol despite being underage. These types of headlines can have a negative influence on impressionable teens who might falsely believe that they should follow suit to appear cool or successful.Poor morals aren’t the only issue, as many popular stars are also well-known for their irresponsible spending habits. They routinely splurge on luxury items such as designer clothing or expensive cars without any consideration for budgeting or saving money responsibly. This kind of behaviour is dangerous because it is normalizing materialism and teaching teens that costly possessions will bring them happiness instead of focusing on what really matters in life: meaningful relationships, knowledge, and hard work.To conclude, young adults should keep in mind that society’s perception of fame and fortune is based on temporary, insubstantial things rather than what actually matters. In the grand scheme of things, it would be far more beneficial for teenagers to spend time developing their own set of values rooted in quality education and strong family relationships.;The phenomenon of teenagers idolizing celebrities as role models has become increasingly prevalent in today's society. However, the question arises as to whether this is a positive influence on young minds. In my opinion, I strongly disagree that having a celebrity as a role model is a good idea, primarily because many celebrities often set a bad example for their young followers.Celebrities often lack moral values and promote behaviour that is entirely inappropriate for young people. For instance, some music videos feature explicit lyrics that glorify drug use and violence, which can have a detrimental impact on impressionable minds. These explicit content can shape their views on what is acceptable and desirable, potentially leading them down a path of destructive behaviour. Furthermore, the promotion of such behaviour can desensitize teenagers to the harm caused by drug use and violence, which is a pressing concern for society as a whole.In addition to promoting harmful behaviour, celebrities are also well-known for their irresponsible spending habits. They often flaunt their wealth through extravagant purchases and lavish lifestyles, which can create unrealistic expectations among young people. This can lead to a sense of entitlement and an overemphasis on material possessions, which can be damaging to their self-esteem and values. Therefore, it is crucial for teenagers to have role models who embody positive values and behaviour, rather than looking up to celebrities who often prioritize their public image over setting a good example. By doing so, we can ensure that the younger generation grows up with a strong moral compass and a healthy perspective on life.
1359;Nowadays more and more people want to live by themselves, why is this happening?;Nowadays more and more people want to live by themselves. What are the reasons? Is it a positive or negative trend?These days a vast majority of people want to lead an independent life. The fundamental reason lies in people’s educational qualifications that fuel their craving for freedom in life. This can be seen as a positive trend because living alone is likely to nurture a mature mindset at early stages of one’s life.Many people are well educated to stand up on their own. Tertiary education broadens their horizons, and they wish to experience freedom of life. With a very good educational background it becomes easier to find a well-paid job, and with lucrative income they gain confidence to lead an independent life, thereby achieving their goals. For example, engineering graduates can find a job in another town and their salary is enough for them to move and settle down there. This enables them to move away from their family and live on their own.Living alone helps one to develop maturity, which can be seen as a positive impact on individuals and the society as a whole. Being independent means young people have to face life challenges alone and going through this process improves their resilience. They become more responsible, as they have to take care of themselves and develop budgeting skills and saving habits, for their future needs as well. Better planning of their finances nurtures the custom of wise spending at early stages of adult life.In conclusion, the reason why many people wish to live independently these days is because their education level gives them both the awareness of freedom in life and means of achieving it. Since living alone promotes one’s maturity, it seems to be a positive trend in today’s society.This response covers the task requirements by addressing the two parts of the question, why people choose to live alone and whether this is a positive trend. The ideas are clearly explained and supported, the information is organised in paragraphs in an easy to follow way, and the level of coherence is adequate. A range of complex sentence forms is used and there are no grammatical errors. Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.;The phenomenon of individuals opting to live alone has become increasingly prevalent in recent times. This shift in living arrangements has sparked curiosity about the underlying reasons behind this trend. On one hand, the primary motivation for people to live by themselves stems from a desire for independence and autonomy. Living alone allows individuals to make their own decisions, free from the influence of others, and to establish a sense of self-reliance. Moreover, the fast-paced and demanding nature of modern life often necessitates solitude, enabling individuals to recharge and manage their time more effectively.Another significant factor contributing to this trend is the changing nature of family dynamics and social relationships. With the rise of nuclear families and the decline of extended family structures, people are more inclined to live alone, especially after the age of marriage or when their children leave home. Furthermore, the increased mobility and migration of the workforce have led to individuals relocating for career advancement, often resulting in solitary living arrangements. Whether this trend is positive or not is subjective and depends on various factors, including cultural context and personal preferences. However, living alone can foster self-sufficiency, personal growth, and improved time management skills, which can be highly beneficial. On the other hand, it may also lead to isolation, increased expenses, and a lack of emotional support, highlighting the need for a balanced approach to this lifestyle choice. Ultimately, the decision to live alone is a personal one, influenced by a multitude of factors, and its implications vary greatly from one individual to another.

For instance, in many countries, cricket is the most famous game, with children and adults alike playing it whenever they have free time in their daily lives. The allure of cricket lies not just in the enjoyment it provides but also in the potential for financial gain, whether through professional playing contracts, sponsorships, or betting.However, there are many individuals whose primary aim is to spend more time making money rather than pursuing their own interests. Unfortunately, this mindset often leads people towards unhealthy or unproductive habits. For example, drinking alcohol has become one of the popular hobbies among certain groups, particularly those with low income, as a means to temporarily escape their hardships. This not only affects their health but also diverts their time and resources away from more beneficial activities.The pursuit of trends and the desire to make more money are driving forces behind how people allocate their time. While following the latest trends can bring happiness and financial rewards, it's essential for individuals to maintain a balance between their interests, financial ambitions, and overall well-being. Engaging in activities solely for monetary gains, especially those that are harmful, can lead to negative consequences. Therefore, it's crucial for people to be mindful of how they spend their time, ensuring that their choices align with their long-term health, happiness, and personal growth. By doing so, individuals can harness the benefits of staying on trend while avoiding the pitfalls of misguided time allocation.
701;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. In this essay, the reason for wasting food and the acts which can be done by humans to reduce the amount of food one throws away will be thorougly discussed.Firstly, people waste food as one tends to be satisfied with the amount one eats. Thus, people order food more than one can eat as one can not estimate the amount of food. The amount of food one person can consume differs on one's conditions at that moment. The conditions include mood, physical features and activities one did on that particular day. Furthermore, one wants to taste all sorts of food, however, one can not eat all of those. Sometimes, people order food which are well decorated just to take a photo of it and upload it on social media such as Instagram. After taking photo, people just leave the food. The above mentioned reasons can be the causes of wastage of food.Apparently, people can reduce the amount of food they throw away. The restaurants can provide more informations about the amount and taste briefly to avoid the situation that consumers can not finish the food and are dissatisfied with the taste or smell. Moreover, consumers have to make a wise decision so that they do not waste both food and money. People should co-operate to reduce the wastage of food as it causes pollution on land. It leads to bad smell and brings insects to the areas.Conclusively, it is quite clear that people greatly waste food and there are a few ways for people to follow so as to reduce the amount of waste food.;"The issue of food waste has become a pressing concern in today's society. It is estimated that a significant amount of food is wasted, particularly food that is bought from shops and restaurants. In my opinion, one of the primary reasons for this phenomenon is that people tend to be satisfied with the amount they eat, and this amount can vary greatly depending on their conditions at that moment. For instance, a person may feel more hungry after exercising and therefore eat more, while on other days they may not be as hungry and end up leaving food uneaten.Another factor contributing to food waste is the growing trend of ordering food for aesthetic purposes. Many people, especially on social media, order food that is well decorated and visually appealing, just to take a photo of it. This practice, often referred to as ""food styling,"" can lead to a significant amount of food being wasted, as the food is often not consumed after the photo has been taken. Furthermore, restaurants and shops also play a role in food waste, as they often provide large portions or excess food to attract customers, which can result in uneaten food being discarded.To reduce the amount of food thrown away, several steps can be taken. Firstly, restaurants and shops can offer smaller portion sizes or flexible meal options to cater to different appetites. Additionally, consumers can be more mindful of their food intake and plan their meals accordingly. Moreover, social media platforms can promote sustainable food practices and discourage the trend of ordering food solely for photography purposes. By adopting these measures, we can work towards minimizing food waste and promoting a more sustainable food culture. Ultimately, it is crucial that we recognize the value of food and take collective responsibility to reduce waste and ensure that the food we produce is consumed and not discarded unnecessarily."
1354;Nowadays people waste a lot of food, why is this happening and how to reduce waste?;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?At the time when famines heavily strike impoverished third world countries, many people living in wealthy countries waste tremendous amounts of food daily. In my opinion, understanding the probable reasons of this phenomenon is important and may lead us to some applicable solutions that will result in reducing food waste.The low cost of food seems to be one of the obvious reasons, exacerbating the problem. Due to the revolutionary technological achievements, people have increased both the quality and the quantity of their crops. In turn, according to the laws of supply and demand, the prices of the crops have immensely dropped. A recent study of the FAO stated that the global crops prices have dropped 50 per cent over the last decade. This enabled people to buy excessive amounts of food without a real need.Furthermore, the absence of strict regulations to discourage or punish this attitude can also be considered a major cause. Not everyone is aware that wasting food may create problems. Consequently, they are likely to resist any calls for controlling the consumption of dietary supplies unless they are forced by the power of law. Several countries in the world saw a drop in their national food waste after implementing a ban on the excessive purchasing of food.Fortunately, there are some possible approaches that can be adopted by both people and governments. Firstly, raising the awareness of this issue is immensely important. Using social media platforms can draw public attention to the potential dangers of food waste and how communities can confront it. Secondly, enforcing laws that prohibit the wasting of food by people and companies will deter such harmful practice.In conclusion, the decreased price of food as well as lack of regulations allowed the unfortunate trend of throwing away food to continue. I believe that creating awareness and legislation are parts of a straightforward solution to this issue.The writer explored the reasons for throwing away food and suggested some solutions, effortlessly conveying his/her ideas in this well-written IELTS essay. The information is presented in an orderly, logical and coherent way. A wide range of vocabulary is used in this written response. The sentence structures are varied and the vocabulary is impressive. Overall, this essay could achieve IELTS Band 8.;The issue of food waste has become a pressing concern in today's society. It is estimated that a substantial amount of food purchased from shops and restaurants ends up in landfills, rather than on dining tables. In my opinion, there are several reasons contributing to this phenomenon. Firstly, people's buying habits play a significant role. Many individuals tend to purchase more food than they can consume, often tempted by attractive deals or abundant supplies. As a result, a considerable amount of edible food is discarded due to expiration or spoilage.Another factor is the lack of meal planning and portion control. When eating out, often, large servings are provided, leading to unfinished meals being thrown away. Furthermore, people's busy lifestyles also contribute to food waste. With increasingly hectic schedules, leftovers are frequently forgotten, and eventually, discarded. To mitigate this issue, several measures can be taken. Firstly, individuals can adopt a more mindful approach to grocery shopping by making lists and sticking to them, avoiding impulse buys. Restaurants and shops can also play a part by offering smaller portions or flexible meal options, reducing the likelihood of unfinished meals. Additionally, education and awareness campaigns can be launched to inform the public about the consequences of food waste, encouraging people to rethink their consumption habits. Implementing such strategies can significantly decrease the amount of food waste, contributing to a more sustainable food system. By being more conscientious and responsible in our food choices, we can work towards minimizing the staggering amounts of waste generated daily. Ultimately, it is crucial that we acknowledge the gravity of this issue and take collective action to rectify it.
25;Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?;"It is a serious problem that there is an inadequate number of students who tend to select science as their major subject in universities in many countries. In my view, students may think that studying science has not a good career path. Also, this issue may deeply affect the international state of a country.The main reason why people do not think to study science is that they may see science as something unpractical, and potentially, they are hard to find a job when they graduate. Students are generally afraid that there is no employment opportunity after they graduate from university. Unlike engineering and business management, in which fields employers provide plenty of vocational positions for graduated students because there are lots of companies activating in these fields and universities may provide some practical training courses and internships. Students studying science have a relatively narrow way to walk, and may just be scientists. Moreover, although a successful scientist can get a massive bonus from some prizes, it is too hard to accomplish and is more likely to fail. Therefore, Students will avoid taking those risks and choose other subjects that are relatively stable and easy to find a job.This trend will eventually decrease the state of a country. Developing science can provide a strong and firm foundation for a country to establish a healthy and prosperous community. If there are not enough scientists, the whole scientific ability will decrease. Not only will the government pay extra money to other foreign countries to buy the required technology such as military equipment, but the public needs to spend more time and pay more effort to maintain the international standard production rate of a country. It is extremely dangerous that a nation easily suffers from a financial crisis and, finally, it influences the living standard of its citizens and causes damage to its financial systems.In summary, while science is regarded as a ""useless"" subject because of its narrow career path and low success rate, it is vital that the economic systems would be affected if a country develop without scientists.";"The decline in students choosing science subjects in university is a pressing concern in many countries. One of the primary reasons for this trend is the perception that science is a ""useless"" subject, offering a narrow career path and low success rate. Many students believe that pursuing a science degree will lead to limited job opportunities and a lack of financial stability. Furthermore, while a successful scientist can receive a massive bonus from prestigious prizes, such as the Nobel Prize, the reality is that achieving such heights is extremely challenging and more likely to end in failure. The risk of dedicating years of study and research to a field with such a low probability of success is a daunting prospect for many students.The effects of this trend on society are far-reaching and profound. A lack of skilled scientists and researchers can hinder a country's ability to develop and innovate, ultimately impacting its economic and social progress. Developing science provides a strong and firm foundation for a country to establish a healthy and prosperous community. Scientific advancements can lead to breakthroughs in medicine, technology, and environmental sustainability, improving the overall quality of life for citizens. Without a robust pool of talented scientists, a country may struggle to stay competitive in the global arena, ultimately affecting its economic growth and social well-being. It is essential for governments, educational institutions, and industries to work together to promote the value and importance of science education, providing students with a supportive and rewarding environment to pursue their scientific interests and passions. By doing so, we can encourage more students to choose science subjects and foster a brighter, more innovative future for our communities."

These days, we are surrounded by an array of sugary beverages, including juice, coffee, tea, and soft drinks. The reasons behind this trend are multifaceted. One major factor is the convenience and accessibility of these drinks. They are widely available, affordable, and often marketed as a quick energy boost. Additionally, the taste and variety of sugary drinks make them a popular choice among people of all ages.However, this growing dependence on sugar-based drinks has severe consequences for our health and the environment. Excessive sugar consumption is linked to various health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay. Furthermore, the production and packaging of these drinks contribute to pollution and waste, hindering our goal of a healthy, wealthy, and clean world.To mitigate this issue, it is essential to adopt healthier habits. One solution is to encourage people to drink less sugary beverages and opt for water, unsweetened tea, or coffee instead. Moreover, incorporating exercise into our daily routine can help reduce the craving for sugary drinks. By doing exercises every day, we can improve our overall health and increase our energy levels naturally, reducing the need for sugar-based energy boosts. Governments and companies can also play a role by promoting healthier alternatives, implementing sugar taxes, and reducing the sugar content in their products. Ultimately, by making conscious choices and developing better habits, we can work towards a healthier and more sustainable future. By combining regular exercise with a balanced diet and reducing our reliance on sugary drinks, we can create a better world for ourselves and future generations.

Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Many people after their high school years for several reason which they choose . I believe that the most common reason why people to have new experiences on life , to prepare for a career, and to increase their knowledge of their personality.Firstly, many people to have new experience in life. Many students leave their home and move to live when they go to university. This is the first time that they had to make a resolution on their own, without their parents’ help. Making their own decisions will increase their knowledge of themselves. Moreover, students university can meet different students from different nationalities and religions so students can learn about different around the world.Secondly, many people go to university or collage to prepare for a career.

All of these prepare them for their career.Also, students attend university or college to increase their self-knowledge of their personality life. They attend increase their knowledge in subjects which they find interesting. For example, many students study science because they are in science but they work .To sum up, I think people should not only focus on a career when they go to university or college. They have to follow to have new experience and knowledge about their personality and the great world around them which they live in.;People attend college or university for many different reasons. After completing their high school years, many individuals choose to pursue higher education for several compelling reasons. The most common motivations include the desire for new experiences, career preparation, and the pursuit of increased knowledge.For many, attending college or university is an opportunity to have new experiences in life. It provides a chance to meet new people, make lifelong friends, and engage in extracurricular activities that foster personal growth and development. This exposure to diverse environments and cultures broadens one's perspective, helping to shape their personality and worldview. Moreover, the independence that comes with college life allows students to take responsibility for their actions, make decisions, and learn from their mistakes, all of which are invaluable life experiences.Another significant reason people attend college is for career preparation.

1253;People living in large cities have to face many problems in everyday life. What are those problems?Should the government encourage people to move to regional towns?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is not surprise to see that major cities are struggling with various issues which may associate with goverment and public issues as well.These issues are mild in some cities where as severe and vulnerable in few cities.Some of the common problems are increased crime rate,reduced safety,air pollution,noise pollution,flood,mechanical life and reduced greenery.The main cause for the above issues are increased population,uncontrolled carbon emission,poorly planned road and other public facilities such as underground drainage,contaminated water,roads and electricity.In general if the government take steps to control the above mentioned issues by implenting good law and orders which can improve public safety and happiness.Assist the sanitary boards with proper funding which may help to reduce water stagnant during rainy season.Funding for new research and developments may enhance to clear air and water pollution which can bring good health to the local residents.In contrast government may consider to develop the nearest towns with basic facilities such as modern housing,educational advancements,good roads,water and sanitary facilities. These facilities enhance the people to move to smaller town which may enhance to manage the key issues which are currently facing in the major cities.For instance Delhi,Capital of India seriously struggling with severe air pollution and lack of security which is heavily populated.Researches says that these problems can be reduced if the population rate is reduced.Meantime some group of people suggests that if the government may adopt new technology or structure which are following by any successful cities in the world.I personally feels that this also could be a better solution if it can be adopted by the government.By arguing the possitive and negative impacts it is difficult to conclude which option may works better to sove the issues.;The rapid growth of large cities has led to a multitude of problems that residents face in their daily lives. Some of the common issues include an increased crime rate, reduced safety, air and noise pollution, flooding, a mechanical lifestyle, and reduced greenery. The primary cause of these problems is the overwhelming population, uncontrolled carbon emissions, and poorly planned roads and public facilities.The increased population in cities leads to a strain on resources, resulting in inadequate waste management, insufficient public transportation, and overcrowding. This, in turn, contributes to the rise in crime rates, air and noise pollution, and flooding. Furthermore, the mechanical lifestyle that city dwellers lead, coupled with the lack of green spaces, can have severe impacts on mental and physical health.To mitigate these issues, the government should implement effective laws and regulations to control the population growth, reduce carbon emissions, and improve public facilities. By doing so, the government can improve public safety and overall happiness. For instance, investing in renewable energy sources, improving public transportation, and creating more green spaces can significantly reduce pollution and enhance the quality of life.Encouraging people to move to regional towns can also be a viable solution. Regional towns often have a more relaxed pace of life, cleaner environments, and a stronger sense of community. By providing incentives such as affordable housing, job opportunities, and quality education, the government can encourage people to relocate to regional areas, thereby reducing the strain on city resources. Ultimately, a balanced approach that addresses the root causes of these problems and promotes sustainable development can help alleviate the issues faced by people living in large cities. By taking proactive steps, the government can create a better quality of life for its citizens, both in cities and regional towns.
645;People often think about creating an ideal society, but most of the times fail in making this happen.What is your opinion about an ideal societyHow can we create an ideal society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"One of the ambition of the people is to create a harmonious community to live in. Unfortunately, individuals often fail to create one. This essay will discuss what is an ideal society, as well as ways on how to make it happen.An ideal community is a place where peace of mind over shadows fear. We all now that everyone wants a place that is criminal free. For example, people can just walk in an aisle without thinking of being raped or kidnapped. Moreover, it is a community in which discrimination, prejudice and racism is prohibited. In short, everyone is treated equally regardless of gender, colors, religions, social status, jobs and looks. It also means that, people can just walk in and out of a hospital or establishments without being looked down or degraded by other people especially those with high status.However, it is difficult for people to meet this kind of standards. This mainly because nobody is made perfect and as a human being we are mostly dominated by hatred, jealousy and selfishness. Although people fail to have a perfect society, there are some ways on how to have a near perfect place to live. First of all, government should make the lives of the people a better one by being an active role model to the citizens. There should not be corruption involve amongst the higher ups. Also, as what the saying goes ""learning should start at home"", it means that, parents should the take the initiative to educate their children proper manners in dealing with other people. In Japan, children were taught in a very young age on how to treat other people. That is why they always bow down their head as a sign of respect.To conclude, creating an essential environment can be challenging and demanding for all of us. Eventhough, it is impossible to make, each one of us can has the capacity to contribute to make society an almost perfect one.";The concept of an ideal society has long been a topic of discussion among philosophers, policymakers, and individuals alike. In my opinion, an ideal society is a place where peace of mind overshadows fear, where everyone is treated equally regardless of their gender, color, religion, social status, job, and physical appearance. This utopian community is built on the principles of mutual respect, understanding, and acceptance. However, creating such a society is a daunting task, as it requires a fundamental shift in human behavior and mindset.One of the primary reasons why an ideal society is difficult to achieve is that people often harbor biases and prejudices that prevent them from treating others with equality and respect. Moreover, societal norms and expectations can perpetuate discrimination and inequality. Nevertheless, there are ways to create a near-perfect place to live. One crucial step is for parents to take the initiative to educate their children on proper manners and values such as empathy, kindness, and respect for others. By instilling these values from a young age, children can grow up to be open-minded and tolerant individuals who contribute to creating a harmonious community.Furthermore, education and awareness programs can also play a significant role in promoting equality and social cohesion. For instance, schools and community centers can organize workshops and activities that celebrate diversity and promote intercultural understanding. Additionally, leaders and policymakers can implement policies that promote social justice and equality, such as affirmative action programs and anti-discrimination laws. While creating an ideal society may be a challenging task, it is not impossible. By starting with small steps, such as educating our children and promoting awareness and understanding, we can work towards building a community that values equality, respect, and peace.
1326;People should follow the local customs and traditions, when they come to live in a new country. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The globalised world these days makes it simpler than ever before for people to relocate and start building a life in a new country. As everyone comes from their own cultural background, a question arises of whether or not people should be expected to follow the customs of their host country. I completely agree with the view that while learning about the local customs may require some time and effort, it is valuable and will aid the integration of the newcomers into society.In many cultures following the local customs means showing respect, which is an important moral value in nearly every culture. The opposite is also true: disregarding traditions is often seen as a sign of disrespect. In order to establish good neighbourly relationships and feel welcome in the new place, it is important to demonstrate the effort to become part of the community. By expressing an interest in learning traditions, new arrivals gain a chance to interact with their neighbours and colleagues, get to know them and build some connections in the new country.Another positive aspect is the enhanced feeling of belonging that people get from participating in activities others around them are doing. When a national festival is in full swing, standing on the sidelines might make people feel excluded and perhaps even homesick, whereas joining others opens up opportunities to attend special events together, go to parties, meet new people and feel part of the celebrations. In Australia, for example, Easter is a very special time of the year and some of the traditional activities include Easter egg decoration and gifting, and baking hot cross buns; sharing your designs and recipes with others is an excellent conversation starter.In conclusion, learning the customs and traditions of one’s new country doesn’t mean a loss of their own culture. On the contrary, it is an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of cultural connections and should be embraced as a positive experience.";In today's globalised world, it is simpler than ever before for people to relocate and start building a life in a new country. As a result, the question of whether people should follow local customs and traditions when moving to a new country has become increasingly relevant. I strongly agree that people should adopt the local customs and traditions when they move to a new country.Following local customs is a fundamental aspect of integrating into a new society. In many cultures, adhering to local customs means showing respect, which is an important moral value in nearly every culture. By embracing the local way of life, newcomers demonstrate their willingness to adapt and be a part of their new community. This, in turn, helps to foster a sense of belonging and facilitates a smoother transition into the new environment.Moreover, expressing an interest in learning traditions provides new arrivals with a chance to interact with their neighbours and feel welcome in the new place. When people make an effort to understand and participate in local customs, they are more likely to receive a warm welcome from the community. This can lead to meaningful relationships and a stronger sense of connection to the new country. Furthermore, by adopting local customs, individuals can gain a deeper understanding of the culture and history of their new home, which can be a truly enriching experience.In conclusion, following local customs and traditions is essential for people who relocate to a new country. Not only does it demonstrate respect for the local culture, but it also facilitates integration and helps newcomers feel at home. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, it is more important than ever to appreciate and adopt the customs and traditions of our new communities.
1370;People should not work beyond the retirement age (agree/disagree);Some believe that people should not continue to work once they reach the age of retirement. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your experience.In recent years, with the improvement in healthcare sector and better , people are able to live longer and contribute to the economic progress of a nation more, compared to the past. Some see this as an entirely positive development, while others point out the drawbacks of working beyond the retirement age.Delaying retirement enables individuals to actively contribute to the society. On a personal level, working past retirement age provides an avenue for individuals to remain not only physically but also mentally active. Moreover, this option empowers the ageing population to be financially independent and economically self-sustainable past retirement age. In countries with growing ageing population such as Singapore, for instance, citizens are given an option to work beyond their retirement age based on the demands of their job and their capability to handle these tasks. Hence, working beyond retirement age empowers workers, ensures economic progression of the nation, and alleviates the challenges faced by an ageing population.On the flip side, working beyond the retirement age may result in adverse health impacts on workers and a decrease in productivity levels. In Japan, the suicide rates have recently been increasing due to rising stress levels at work faced by the ageing population who are pushed to work beyond their optimal capacity. Escalating stress levels from work to various health complications putting a strain on the healthcare system. Hence, working beyond retirement age may worsen the overall welfare of individuals and adversely impact the economy.To sum up, though working beyond retirement age health hazards leading to reduction in productivity levels, it seems to me that the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion, by assessing the capability of individuals and tailoring their jobs to their health profile, firms and companies should actively involve their workers to be productive beyond their retirement age.This essay is an excellent example of IELTS Band 8 writing. The author presents sound arguments making his/her point of view very clear, examples are being used to support the writer’s points and the organisation of information is handled very well. There are some minor inaccuracies, however, they wouldn’t affect the score much in the real test. Well done!;I disagree with the notion that people should not work beyond the retirement age. While some believe that individuals should cease working once they reach the age of retirement, I think that this perspective is overly simplistic and fails to account for the diverse needs and desires of older workers.On the one hand, working beyond retirement age can have numerous physical and mental health benefits. Many people find that continuing to work keeps them mentally stimulated, socially engaged, and physically active, which can contribute to a longer and healthier life. For instance, a friend's grandmother continued to work as a part-time librarian until the age of 75, and she often remarked that it was the highlight of her day, providing her with a sense of purpose and belonging. On the other hand, allowing people to work beyond retirement age can also have economic benefits. With the increasing life expectancy and rising cost of living, many retirees may not have sufficient savings to support themselves, and continuing to work can provide them with a much-needed income supplement. Furthermore, working beyond retirement age can also help to alleviate the burden on pension systems and social security, as older workers continue to contribute to the workforce and pay taxes.In conclusion, I firmly believe that people should be allowed to work beyond the retirement age if they so choose. Not only can it have numerous health and economic benefits, but it also provides individuals with the freedom to pursue their passions and interests, and to continue making meaningful contributions to society. Ultimately, the decision to work beyond retirement age should be a personal choice, and one that is free from restrictive age limits.
709;People think that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. Others believe that there are other alternative solutions for reducing crime.Discuss both views and give your opinion on this topic.;"Nowadays the sentences that judges give to criminals is always at the centre of attention of the society; some people think that the best way to reduce the amount of crime cases is to give longer prison sentences, while, others say that there are other alternative ways to stop it. This essay will talk about both views and, at the end, I will give my opinion about the argument.It is always more common to see long sentences for criminals, also if their crimes are not too bad to deserve that type of punishment; the reason why the court gives to them long sentences is because they think that staying a lot in prison will make the criminals understand that what they did is wrong and, next time, they will think twice before doing something bad or against the law.However long sentences can go against the human rights because they will take away from prisoners years of their life; for this reason, some people think that it can be better if, instead of stay close in a jail without doing nothing, they can be used in various works that will make them useful for the society and better person at the end of the sentence, like cleaning the city, helping old people in retirement homes and also cook for poor people.I think that there are other ways to stop crime instead of giving long punishments, also because everyone should have a second chance in their life and, more importantly, teach and show to prisoners different aspects of the community will help cities to become better places with less crimes to stop.This essay talked about two different types of views about crime sentences in our society, with my own opinion about the argument in the last part of it.";The issue of reducing crime has been a longstanding debate among policymakers and citizens alike. Some people think that the best way to reduce the amount of crime cases is to give longer prison sentences, as this would serve as a deterrent to potential offenders. They argue that harsher punishments would make individuals think twice before committing a crime, and thus, reduce the overall crime rate. This approach is based on the idea that punishment is an effective means of controlling behavior and maintaining social order.On the other hand, others say that there are other alternative ways to stop crime. They propose that addressing the root causes of crime, such as poverty, lack of education, and unemployment, would be more effective in reducing crime rates. These alternatives include implementing social programs, such as job training, education, and community development projects. Proponents of this view argue that these programs can help to prevent crime by providing individuals with opportunities and support, thereby reducing the likelihood of their involvement in criminal activities.This essay will discuss both views and examine the arguments presented by each side. After considering the different perspectives on this issue, I will give my own opinion about the argument. In my opinion, while longer prison sentences may have some deterrent effect, they do not address the underlying causes of crime. Therefore, I believe that alternative solutions, such as social programs and community development, are more likely to have a lasting impact on reducing crime rates. By addressing the root causes of crime, we can work towards creating a safer and more just society for all.
1286;People today find their lives more and more dominated by their jobs. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is certainly true that many people around the world find their lives dominated by the work that they have to do. This is shown when you realise how people’s work, and how much time, effort and resources they devote to it, is often the subject of conversation.Most people depend on their jobs to generate an income to pay for their lives’ necessities and luxuries, and so work can naturally become a dominating focus. As this is an important part of nearly everyone’s everyday life, it can seem that people’s lives are indeed becoming more influenced by their jobs. Whether this emphasis on work is more significant now than in previous years is debatable. In many developed countries around the world, there are procedures in place to help people with finding work, providing unemployment benefits, ensuring education, and offering pension payments. In times past, these provisions were not in place and a job or business was required to provide the necessary income.Therefore, in spite of increases in the cost of living in many places around the world, it can be argued there is actually less pressure than in previous years to keep one’s job and perform well at it. This, in turn, would lead to people’s lives being less influenced by their jobs today. It is also true that in the past, people were as responsible and focused on doing well in their responsibilities as today and so, in this respect, the people of the past would be equally dedicated to their work as people are today.While I agree that people’s lives today are often dominated by their jobs, I feel that the current situation is not necessarily worse than before. In fact, it may be more positive, due to the fewer pressures to earn money in many countries.;The notion that people's lives are increasingly dominated by their jobs is a sentiment that resonates with many individuals around the world. It is undeniable that many people find their lives consumed by the work they have to do, with long hours, demanding responsibilities, and the pressure to constantly perform at high levels. Whether this emphasis on work is more significant now than in previous years is debatable, however, it is clear that the boundaries between work and personal life are becoming increasingly blurred.In many developed countries, there are procedures in place to help people with finding work, providing unemployment benefits, and offering pension payments. These measures aim to support individuals in their careers and provide a sense of security, which can, in turn, reduce the domination of work in their lives. Nevertheless, the reality is that many people still find themselves overwhelmed by their professional commitments. The advent of technology, for instance, has made it easier for work to encroach on personal time, with the expectation to be constantly available and responsive to work-related matters.Despite these supports, the dominance of work in people's lives remains a significant issue. The pursuit of a work-life balance is a challenge many face, with work often taking precedence over personal and family commitments. This can lead to burnout, stress, and a range of other negative impacts on mental and physical health. It is essential for societies to recognize this issue and implement strategies that encourage a healthier balance between work and personal life, ensuring that individuals can maintain their well-being while still being productive and fulfilled in their careers. Ultimately, while there are arguments for and against the statement, it is evident that for many, work does indeed dominate their lives, highlighting the need for a cultural shift towards valuing personal time and well-being equally with professional success.
1264;Percentage of UK people who consumed daily recommended amount of fruit and vegetable in 2002, 2006 and 2010.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar graph compares the proportion of UK citizens in terms of their consumption of daily recommended portions of fruits and vegetables in three different years which are 2002, 2006, and 2010.Overall, females consumed the highest percentage of their recommended healthy food, followed by males, and last are the children.additionally the year 2006 had witnessed the vastest consumption of vegetables and fruits among all given years.Women ate exactly 25% of the daily adviced dose of natural food in the year 2002, 32% in 2006, and 26% in 2010, however men took 22% of the recommended dose in the year 2002, 26% in 2006, and 24% in 2010.On the other hand younger individuals only consumed 11%, 18%, and 16% of the daily requirements of veggies and fruits in the years 2002, 2006, and 2010 respectively. It appears that residents of the UK had eaten the highest daily requirements of greens and fruits in the year 2006 as compared to the years 2006 and 2010.;The bar graph illustrates the proportion of UK citizens who consumed the daily recommended amount of fruit and vegetables in 2002, 2006, and 2010. A comparative analysis of the data reveals significant trends and variations in consumption patterns among different demographics.Overall, the data suggests that females had the highest percentage of consumption, followed by males, and then children. This trend is consistent across all three years, indicating that females are more likely to meet their daily recommended intake of fruits and vegetables. In 2002, approximately 25% of females consumed the recommended amount, compared to 20% of males and 15% of children. Similarly, in 2006 and 2010, females maintained the highest percentage of consumption, with 28% and 30% respectively, while males and children trailed behind.A comparison of the data across the three years reveals a slight increase in consumption among all demographics. Between 2002 and 2006, there was a 3-5% increase in consumption among females, males, and children. However, between 2006 and 2010, the increase was more modest, ranging from 1-3%. This suggests that while there is a positive trend towards increased consumption of fruits and vegetables, the pace of progress has slowed in recent years.In conclusion, the bar graph highlights the disparity in consumption patterns among different demographics in the UK. Females consistently demonstrate the highest percentage of consumption, while children lag behind. The data also suggests a gradual increase in consumption over the years, but at a slowing pace. These findings have implications for public health policy and education initiatives aimed at promoting healthy eating habits among UK citizens.
1402;Popular events like the football world cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The World Cup football and the Olympics are held worldwide with great national support and expectations. As a fan of those competitions, I agree with the idea that sporting events can be necessary for international relations and national unity, but only partially, because such events can have unintended effects on relationships between countries.First of all, the World Cup, Olympics and other international games work for easing tensions among different nations. For example, South and North Korea have football games regularly two nations a chance to understand each other . In the mid of North Korean supporters came to South Korea with the footballers and they were very excited during the sporting events. Even if it sounds ridiculous, many South Koreans were quite surprised at that moment when North Koreans shouted and cried during the match. We all realized that they were very normal sports fans even though they were occasionally very secretive. Through the sports, two divided nations could reduce their political and ideological tensions and could feel the patriotic unity.On the other hand, some sports matches can make international relations worse. For instance, football or baseball games between Korea and Japan are always big matches in two countries where . Sometimes, after the matches, the two rivals blame each other and their patriotic emotions explode in an aggressive way. scenario is that the troubles caused by losing games affect the players directly.;The statement that popular events like the football world cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way is a topic of debate. As a fan of international competitions such as the World Cup football and the Olympics,These events are held worldwide with great national support and expectations, bringing together people from diverse backgrounds and fostering a sense of community and shared experience. I agree with the idea that sporting events can be necessary for international relations and national unity. They provide a platform for countries to engage in healthy competition, promoting diplomacy and cooperation among nations. The excitement and pride that come with supporting one's national team can be a powerful unifying force, allowing citizens to express their patriotism in a positive and controlled manner.However, such events can have unintended effects on relationships between countries. The intense rivalry and strong emotions that accompany these competitions can sometimes lead to increased tensions and conflicts between nations. National pride can occasionally tip into nationalism, causing fans to view the event as a matter of national prestige rather than a celebration of sportsmanship and athletic achievement. Moreover, the political and social issues that surround these events, such as human rights concerns or economic inequalities, can also strain international relationships.In conclusion, while I agree that international sporting events like the World Cup and the Olympics have the potential to ease international tensions and provide a safe outlet for patriotic emotions, it is crucial to acknowledge the complexities and potential downsides of these events. By recognizing both the benefits and the challenges, we can work towards creating a more positive and harmonious international sporting environment.
913;Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:In the past, sporting champions used to be motivated primarily by the desire to win a match or to break world records. These days they are more likely to be motivated by prize money and the opportunity to be famous.What message does this send to young people and how does this attitude to sport affect the sports themselves?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;There were many sport competitions organized after the World-War II since the first Olympic games was held in Athena, in 1963, to bring the world together again. Previously, sport competition was seen as an opportunity for the athletes to break the world records for the pride of their home countries. However, nowadays, people are more inclined to win the match because of money reward and glory. I believe that young people should be more encouraged to achieve their goals to become a champion so that the value of sport competition would not be purely for commercial purpose.In the last decades, there have been a lot of sport competitions being held from national to global level. The athletes were trained by the supported teams to do their best to become the world champion. It was the pride of such athlete to win and see their national flags were rised after the match. Over the years, sport has become more commercial following its popularity to attract global audiences. Many athletes are paying more attention for the opportunity to win the match for commercial purpose. For example, one wants to become a famous soccer player so that they could become the ambassador of Adidas and get more income out of it.Due to the temptation for getting famous and having more money, there are people who choose to play unfairly during a competition. Instead of focusing on increasing their skills, they would cheat to win the game for money. For example, a soccer player may use thyroid injection for boosting their energy level even though it is strictly prohibited. Moreover, sport is not seen anymore to promote peace and solidarity among people from different cultural backgrounds but for the chance to get the superficial gloriness.To conclude, even if the motivation has shifted, the young people should learn to focus more on becoming a real champion and play fairly so that they can become the best athletes in thier expertise while the money and glory would follow them after.;The world of sports has undergone a significant transformation in recent years. In the past, sporting champions were driven by a passion to win and break records, but nowadays, the primary motivator is often prize money and the allure of fame. This shift in motivation sends a concerning message to young people and has a profound impact on the sports themselves.As sport has become more commercial, following its growing popularity and ability to attract global audiences, its essence has changed. Many athletes are now more focused on the commercial benefits of winning, rather than the joy of competition and self-improvement. This is evident in the way some athletes prioritize prize money and sponsorship deals over the actual sport. Instead of concentrating on honing their skills, some individuals are tempted to play unfairly during competitions, compromising the integrity of the game. This not only undermines the spirit of fair play but also sets a bad example for young athletes who look up to them as role models.The emphasis on financial gain and fame can also lead to a culture of corruption and cheating in sports. When winning becomes the only objective, some athletes may feel pressured to take shortcuts or resort to unsportsmanlike conduct to achieve success. This can have severe consequences, including damaging the reputation of the sport and disillusioning fans. Furthermore, the obsession with prize money and fame can also lead to a lack of sportsmanship and respect among competitors, which is essential for maintaining the dignity and beauty of sports.In conclusion, the changing motivations of sporting champions from a desire to win and break records to a focus on prize money and fame sends a disturbing message to young people. It promotes a culture of commercialism and winning at all costs, rather than the values of hard work, fair play, and sportsmanship. As a result, it is essential to reclaim the true spirit of sports and encourage athletes to prioritize the development of their skills and the joy of competition over financial gain and celebrity status.
903;Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:Some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by giving them extra money. This practice can act as an incentive for some but may also have a negative impact on others.To what extent is this style of management effective?Are there better ways of encouraging employees to work hard?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Running a company and controlling their staff is a big responsibility for employers . In general, employers should have a great vision about the future of their own company and how to improve it in a better way .To start with, some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by simply giving them more many. In addition, that practice can act as a good source of motivation, you can see that your hard work and your extra hours wasn't waste after all .On the other hand, this style of management may affect tha company and their community in a negative way . For example, the manager of the institution may be more focused on just one employee who's always have the extra credit for the work therefore the other employees work hard for nothing and that leave a bad idea that they clearly work for just having that extra money and rewards from the manager .Beside that, employees will be affected and their productivity will change and drop even more and all of that is a result on how the management of a company impact their work and their effort of doing more .To sum it up, all the members in that company worked so hard, a little credit for their effort and long hours of developing their company and rewards them for it won't do any harm . Not to mention, a manager can reward the staff of the institution by giving them a day or two off or basically a three hours break . Anything that make them really satisfied after their long and efficient work towards the developing of the company.;The practice of rewarding exceptional employees with extra money has been a longstanding tradition in many companies. On the surface, this approach appears to be an effective way to motivate staff to work harder and contribute to the company's success. Some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by simply giving them more money,However, this style of management may affect the company and their community in a negative way. For instance, it can create an environment of competition rather than collaboration among employees, leading to a sense of resentment and mistrust. When only a select few receive bonuses, it can demotivate others who feel their efforts are not being recognized or valued. Moreover, this approach can lead to an overemphasis on individual achievement rather than team success, potentially undermining the overall cohesion and morale of the organization.There are better ways of encouraging employees to work hard and contribute to the company's success. For example, offering opportunities for professional development and growth can be a powerful motivator. Providing a positive and supportive work environment, where employees feel valued and recognized for their contributions, can also foster a sense of loyalty and commitment. Additionally, implementing team-based rewards and recognition programs can promote collaboration and a sense of shared achievement. By moving away from a solely monetary reward system, companies can create a more inclusive and motivating work environment that benefits both the organization and its employees. Ultimately, a more holistic approach to employee motivation can lead to greater job satisfaction, productivity, and overall success.
897;Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime.Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In the UK and Australia, a jury is not provided with the defendant's previous criminal history. Some law representatives claim that this should be reverted, and the jury must be provided with this information beforehand. I fully agree with this statement since the jury will have a better understanding of the defendant's behaviour, and the final decision will be easier to understand for the audience.Having the jury the right access to the defendant's past criminal background, would provide the jury with enough information about the defendant's behaviour. This is because there are certain previous criminal behavioural patterns which allow a better profesional decision-making from the part of the jury. For example, a recent study of the Law's Practice of Melboune, has shown that around 77% of people who commit a crime, were involved in at least one criminal event in the past with similar characteristics to the current crime.On the other hand, if the jury has access to the defendant's past criminal history, it would be easier for the audience to understand the nature of the jury's final decision. This is because there have been cases in which the jury's final decision was not completely accepted by the audience or misunderstood. Therefore, providing the jury with enough criminal backgroud records of the defendant will make it clear to understand in beased of what or why the jury's final decision was made.In conclusion, in the UK and Australia, a jury does not have access to a defendant's previous criminal records, and some law representatives claim that this should be reverted. I fully agree with this statement since being provided with this documents will allow the jury a more understanding of the defendant's behaviour, and the final jury's decision will be easier to understand for the audience.;The current practice in the UK and Australia of withholding a defendant's past criminal record from a jury in a criminal case has been a topic of debate among lawyers. While the intention behind this practice is to protect the accused, some law representatives argue that it should be changed, and the jury should be provided with the defendant's previous criminal history before reaching a verdict. I fully agree with this suggestion, as I believe it would enable the jury to make a more informed decision.In the UK and Australia, a jury is not provided with the defendant's previous criminal history, which can lead to a lack of understanding about the defendant's behaviour and motivations. By providing the jury with this information, it would give them a more comprehensive view of the defendant's character and potentially recurring patterns of behaviour. This, in turn, would make the final decision easier to understand and possibly more accurate.For instance, if a defendant has a history of violent crimes, it would be relevant for the jury to know this when assessing their guilt or innocence in a similar case. This knowledge would allow the jury to consider the defendant's propensity for violent behaviour and make a more informed decision. Moreover, it would also help to prevent potentially dangerous individuals from being released back into the community.In conclusion, I strongly believe that a jury should be given access to a defendant's past criminal record. This would not only lead to more informed decisions but also enhance the overall justice system. By providing the jury with a complete picture of the defendant's history, they would be better equipped to make a fair and just verdict. Ultimately, this change would contribute to a more efficient and effective justice system, where the rights of both the accused and the community are protected.
1308;Professional sportsmen and sportswomen and professional entertainers can often command enormous salaries today and this situation reflects society’s dependence on being entertained.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is no secret that today’s entertainment industry is extremely popular, with nearly everyone being engaged at some time in watching TV shows, movies and sports games. The North American sports industry alone generates a massive $67.7 billion every year. With the present emphasis on entertainment, sportsmen and women and professional entertainers can earn enormous salaries, with figures in the millions for one game, appearance or film. This situation certainly does reflect today’s society’s obsession with entertainment.Many people argue that celebrities do not deserve such payment when work in other professions considered of equal or higher value to society is underpaid. A-list celebrities can make over $20 million per movie, whilst many average workers can barely make ends meet. Of course there are lots of people who say that there are better ways the money could be used, rather than allowing such a vast amount to go to just one person. This is a fairly naive point of view, though. So long as people wish to watch entertainment, advertising in turn will be present and the most watched celebrities will be able to earn high salaries, as their presence will ensure the high viewing figures the advertisers desire.Though celebrities and sportsmen and sportswomen often make very large sums of money, it can also be seen as unfair to say that they do not deserve it or propose their money be used for something else. While it is true that they did not find a cure for cancer or made a life-changing scientific discovery, their hard work and expertise created a product that the public wants to see and the high payment merely reflects their value.In conclusion, it is clear that today’s society is indeed a society obsessed with being entertained and the high salaries paid to those who entertain society clearly reflect this. The high payments, however, are not necessarily out of place or undeserved.;The notion that professional sportsmen, women, and entertainers can command enormous salaries due to society's dependence on entertainment has sparked intense debate. While some argue that these individuals deserve their lucrative paychecks,Many people argue that celebrities do not deserve such payment when work in other professions, considered of equal or higher value to society, is underpaid. For instance, teachers, nurses, and social workers are often undercompensated despite their crucial contributions to society. In contrast,Many people say that there are better ways the money could be used, rather than allowing such a vast amount to go to just one person. The staggering amounts paid to celebrities could be redirected towards more pressing social issues, such as education, healthcare, or environmental conservation. This redistribution of wealth could have a more significant positive impact on society as a whole.However, it is also true that the entertainment industry is driven by supply and demand. So long as people wish to watch entertainment, advertising will, in turn, be present, and the most watched celebrities will be able to earn high salaries. The market dictates that top performers can command high fees due to their ability to attract large audiences and generate substantial revenue. In conclusion, while it is understandable that many people disagree with the vast amounts paid to celebrities, it is also important to recognize the role of market forces in driving these salaries. Ultimately, the payments received by professional sportsmen, women, and entertainers reflect the societal value placed on entertainment, as well as the significant revenue generated by this industry.
1311;Providing a national system in a country where the unemployed receive a regular payment only encourages people not to seek work and puts an unreasonable strain on a country’s financial resources.Discuss this statement and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;In modern day society, money is a driving force for nearly everyone. Most people aspire to be financially secure and to have the ability to live the life they want. However, not everyone is able to find paid employment, and for that reason in some countries around the world, governments have initiated a system where the unemployed receive a regular payment to enable them to survive. Some people believe it is an excellent idea, whilst others believe that it is exhausting a country’s financial resources.When looking at the positive aspects of this system, it can be said that it prevents individuals from having a private bankruptcy. When somebody becomes unemployed, he or she will have on-going costs such as rent for a dwelling, bills for water, telephone and electricity as well as the cost of food and several other things. Without a salary, this person will fall into debt, because they will be unable to cover these expenses. A national unemployment payment system will therefore prevent this person from losing nearly everything over time. Without such system, many people would become homeless and would potentially engage in criminal activities to survive. Therefore, one can say that this system is positive. Although stories are heard of people exploiting the system, usually the newly unemployed want to find a job fast in order to become financially independent again, meaning that the government does not have to support them for long.Although there are positive aspects of this system, one can also say that if the payment made by the government is too high, it will prevent people from looking for work actively. Occasionally, the payment people receive is higher than their potential salaries, deterring them from working and creating an on-going cost for the government. A potential solution for this could be providing free training and employment support to open up new career opportunities with higher income, which would motivate this group to re-enter the workforce.In conclusion, the unemployment benefits system has positive and negative aspects. Personally, I believe that the positive effects of the system outweigh the negative. The payment must remain on a level that helps people survive without regular salaries, but does not seem attractive to exploit over a longer period of time.;The concept of providing a national system where the unemployed receive a regular payment has sparked intense debate among policymakers and citizens alike. Some countries around the world have implemented such a system, aiming to enable the unemployed to survive while they search for new job opportunities. On one hand, some people believe that this system is an excellent idea, as it provides a safety net for individuals who have lost their jobs due to unforeseen circumstances. It allows them to maintain a basic standard of living, reducing the risk of poverty and homelessness.On the other hand, others argue that this system encourages people not to seek work, as they can rely on the regular payment to meet their needs. This, in turn, puts an unreasonable strain on a country's financial resources, as the government has to allocate a significant portion of its budget to fund these payments. For instance, in some European countries, the unemployment benefits system has been criticized for creating a culture of dependency, where individuals prefer to rely on the state rather than actively seeking employment.In my opinion, while the intention behind the unemployment benefits system is noble, its implementation and effectiveness vary greatly depending on the country's economic conditions and social context. A well-designed system with strict eligibility criteria and job training programs can help individuals get back on their feet, whereas a poorly managed system can lead to abuse and inefficiency. In conclusion, the unemployment benefits system has both positive and negative aspects, and its success depends on striking a balance between providing a safety net for the unemployed and encouraging them to seek work and become self-sufficient. Ultimately, a nuanced approach that takes into account the specific needs and challenges of each country is necessary to ensure that the system achieves its intended goals without exhausting the country's financial resources.
1314;Public health is becoming an urgent issue nowadays. Some argue that governments should create nutrition and food choice laws to improve public health, while others believe that it is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Public health has become an increasingly pressing issue in the modern world, with many populations facing rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related diseases. This has led to a debate as to whether governments should establish nutrition and food choice laws for the betterment of public health or if it solely falls on individuals to make wise choices. In my view, everyone should take ownership of their diet and assume responsibility for their health because it is the right choice.The argument for government-imposed nutrition and food choice laws is that they could help prevent people from making unhealthy choices which could lead to more serious illnesses down the line. For example, government regulations could limit the amount of sugar or fats allowed in food products, especially those marketed to children, and impose taxes on unhealthy snacks like chips and candy bars. This approach would also benefit those who lack the knowledge about healthy food, necessary to make informed decisions. By providing clear guidelines on what foods are healthy, and by taxing the unhealthy options higher, the government would steer individuals away from unhealthy options.However, there are also some valid arguments against governmental intervention. These types of regulations infringe upon individuals’ right to choose what they put in their bodies. After all, everyone should be free to make lifestyle choices for themselves. Additionally, there may not be enough evidence to suggest that overly restrictive regulations would have beneficial effects on public health outcomes in the long run. Since people’s love of unhealthy food is often considered an addiction, it is unlikely that a higher price or other warnings would be enough to deter individuals from purchasing unhealthy food items.In conclusion, while there can certainly be benefits associated with implementing nutrition and food choice laws at a governmental level, ultimately it should still come down to personal choice and responsibility as far as one’s diet is concerned. Governments should instead focus on providing citizens with better nutrition education, so that they can make better informed decisions about what they consume. This way, they can receive the information they need while still having autonomy over their own diets and lifestyles.;Public health has become a pressing issue in the modern world, with many populations facing rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related diseases. As a result, the debate surrounding government intervention in nutrition and food choices has gained significant attention. On one hand, some argue that governments should create nutrition and food choice laws to improve public health. The argument is that such laws could help prevent people from making unhealthy choices, thereby reducing the burden of diet-related diseases on the healthcare system. By regulating the food industry and promoting healthier options, governments can play a crucial role in shaping the eating habits of their citizens.However, there are also some valid arguments against governmental intervention. Many believe that what people eat is a matter of personal choice and responsibility, and that individuals should be free to make their own decisions about their diet. Imposing laws on nutrition and food choices could be seen as an overreach of government authority, potentially infringing upon personal freedoms. Furthermore, such laws may not be effective in changing people's behaviors, as individuals may find ways to circumvent regulations or may resist what they perceive as government overreach.In my opinion, while government intervention can play a role in promoting public health, it should be balanced with respect for personal choice and responsibility. Education and awareness campaigns, rather than strict laws, might be a more effective and less intrusive way to encourage healthier eating habits. Ultimately, a combination of government guidance, public awareness, and personal responsibility is likely the most effective approach to addressing the pressing issue of public health in the modern world.
267;Reporting of crimes and other kinds of violent news on television and in newspapers can have adverse consquences. This kind of information should be restricted from being shown in the media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Reporting violent crimes and other violent issues could represents a adverse consequence sometimes. Overall, it is important to enphasyded that people are geting more and more violant and we can't blame only media as a mainly factor for those behavior.This kind of questions is almost a phylosical one and we will keeping this doubt for a long time, or even never now if people are becoming more agressive because they are more expousure to this kind of news, or if we are having more report regarding to violence just because people are getting more violent.I believe that people could feel estimulated to be a criminous person when they have a minimium certain that they won't be punish.For instance, stolen and other minimius crimes had increase at california region after they anounced that stolen under tham $1000 are consider a crime anymore. So the sensation that people could do anything wrong and that is no penalty for that, estimulates the number for stolen.In other hand, when we see some hardly rules the number of crime are dipest low, as we can see at Dubai, for instance. As all penalties are really hard and strongly implemented this place is considering highest safe.I bilieve that restricting any kind of information be showen in the media doesn't solve the problem, and, in fact, bring another new problem related to limited population information. When people know what are happening, type of crimes, etc, they could be prepare to handle with those problems and prevent theirselves.;The reporting of crimes and violent news on television and in newspapers has sparked a heated debate about its potential consequences on society. While some argue that such information should be restricted from the media, I partially disagree with this statement. On one hand, I believe that people could feel stimulated to commit crimes when they have a minimum certainty that they won't be punished. The excessive coverage of violent acts can create a sense of immunity among potential offenders, leading them to believe that they can get away with their crimes. This can be particularly true for impressionable individuals who may be influenced by the glorification of violence in the media.On the other hand, I believe that restricting any kind of information from being shown in the media doesn't solve the problem. Censoring crime reports and violent news can lead to a lack of awareness and understanding of the issues, which are essential for preventing and addressing them. The media plays a crucial role in informing the public about the consequences of crime and the importance of law and order. Moreover, restricting information can also undermine the freedom of the press and the public's right to know. Instead of restricting information, the media should focus on responsible reporting, avoiding sensationalism and glorification of violence. This approach can help to raise awareness about the consequences of crime and promote a safer and more informed society. Ultimately, a balanced and responsible approach to reporting crime and violent news is necessary to ensure that the public is informed without being inspired to commit crimes.
1;Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Poverty represents a worldwide crisis. It is the ugliest epidemic in a region, which could infect countries in the most debilitating ways. To tackle this issue, rich countries need to help those in need and give a hand when possible. I agree that there are several ways of aiding poor countries other than financial aid, like providing countries in need with engineers, workers, and soldiers who would build infrastructure. Building universities, hospitals, and roadways. By having a solid infrastructure, poor countries would be able to monetise their profits and build a stronger and more profitable economy which would help them in the long term. Once unprivilged countries find their niche, the major hurdle would be passed and would definitely pave the way for much brighter future. However, I do disagree that financial aid does not solve poverty, it does if used properly and efficiently. The most determining factor if financial aid would be the way to go, is by identifying what type of poor countries' representative are dealing with. Some countries will have a responsible leader and some will not, with that being said, implementing a strategy, to distinguish responsible leaders from others, would tailor the type of aid rich countries could use. An example, A clear report and constant observation would be applied to track the progress and how this type of aid is being monetized. In summary, types of aid varies from country to another, and tailoring the type of aid is of paramount importance to solve this problem that had huge toll on poor countries.;The issue of poverty represents a worldwide crisis, with far-reaching consequences that affect not only individuals but also entire nations. It is, in fact, the ugliest epidemic in a region, which could infect countries in the most debilitating ways, causing widespread suffering, social unrest, and economic stagnation. In an effort to alleviate this issue, rich countries often provide financial aid to poorer nations. However, the question remains as to whether this approach is truly effective in solving poverty.While financial aid can provide temporary relief, it does not necessarily address the root causes of poverty. In many cases, it can even create dependency and undermine local economies. Therefore, I agree that developed countries should consider giving other types of help to poor countries rather than solely relying on financial aid. For instance, providing technical assistance, investing in education and healthcare, and promoting sustainable development projects can have a more lasting impact on reducing poverty.To tackle this issue, rich countries need to help those in need and give a hand when possible. This can involve sharing knowledge, expertise, and technology to empower local communities and foster self-sufficiency. By doing so, poor countries can break the cycle of poverty and achieve sustainable growth. Ultimately, a combination of financial aid and other forms of assistance can be the most effective way to combat poverty. Rich countries should adopt a more holistic approach, recognizing that poverty is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted solution. By working together and providing a range of support, we can hope to eradicate this debilitating epidemic and create a more equitable and prosperous world for all.
1337;Scientists believe that the world is in danger due to environmental changes. Some people say that personal lifestyle changes should be made to reduce the damage to environment, while others think that the government should do something to help. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Environmental problems are clearly something that is often discussed in today’s world. One part of the society claims that individuals should change their habits and lifestyle to improve the ecological situation. Others, on the other hand, believe that this issue should be solved on the governmental level. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and my perspective will be offered.It is hard to deny that human kind is responsible for the current environmental situation, and it seems impossible to achieve any noticeable result in this field without the participation of vast majority of individuals. For instance, a simple lifestyle change such as introducing the separation of household rubbish can make recycling projects more convenient and efficient. Moreover, consumers can reduce their usage of plastic items and, in turn, less plastic waste will contaminate the environment.However, many people still feel that the government has more tools to prevent environmental changes. One option that the authorities have is to discourage citizens from using personal vehicles by charging high taxes and additional fees. Moreover, politicians usually have access to resources to educate people about environmental problems and promote the most important ecological projects on all levels, ranging from special courses at schools to TV shows and websites related to this topic. Furthermore, it is a key responsibility of the government to protect the environment by spending state funds on research and modern equipment. Countries where legislation protects the ecology, for example Norway, have achieved visible results and overcame most environmental problems.In conclusion, I believe that a combined approach will work best to prevent or reverse environmental changes. A contribution of every individual is just as important as the intervention from the government in order to fix existing issues and save our planet for future generations.;Environmental problems are clearly something that is often discussed in today's world. The alarming rate at which the planet is deteriorating has sparked a heated debate about the most effective way to mitigate the damage. One part of the society claims that individuals should change their habits and lifestyle to improve the ecological situation. They argue that small actions, such as reducing plastic use, using public transport, and conserving energy, can collectively make a significant impact. By making these personal lifestyle changes, individuals can reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to a more sustainable future.Others, on the other hand, believe that this issue should be solved on the governmental level. They argue that the government has the resources and authority to implement large-scale changes that can have a more profound impact on the environment. Governments can enact policies and laws that regulate pollution, protect natural resources, and promote sustainable practices. Additionally, governments can invest in renewable energy, reduce waste, and promote eco-friendly technologies.In my opinion, both views are valid and necessary to address the environmental crisis. While individual actions can collectively make a difference, government intervention is crucial to drive systemic change. Governments can provide the infrastructure and resources needed to support sustainable practices, while individuals can make conscious choices to reduce their environmental impact. Ultimately, a combination of personal lifestyle changes and government action is needed to effectively tackle the environmental problems facing our world today. By working together, we can reduce the damage to the environment and create a more sustainable future for generations to come.
1373;Senior managers should have higher salaries than other employees (agree/disagree);In many countries senior positions have higher salaries compared to those of young workers of the same company. Some people think this isn’t justified. Do you agree or disagree?While some believe that rewarding those in managerial positions with higher pay packets is appropriate, not everyone agrees with this view. Personally, I am leaning towards the latter position due to negative impacts caused by significant difference in salaries within a company.For one, executive officers should know that higher than sufficient salaries are not necessary. Indeed, the higher the remuneration they receive, the more likely the company to suffer from devoid of financial capability. Furthermore, they often gain powers that money can’t buy. For instance, they often make important decisions over how to make their company thrive. They are also entitled to allocate company’s budget and designate tasks to other workers. these non-financial entitlements, they should refrain from earning more than reasonable amounts as salaries.Unreasonably high salaries granted to the executives can also afflict other employees. In fact, it is foreseeable that many employees would feel powerless or even when they find out about the huge salary gap between the executive officers’ and theirs. Accordingly, some may leave the company, and others may go on to strike and demand a pay increase. However, those actions . Therefore, unfair salary systems like this would yield unhealthy working environment for both employers and employees.In conclusion, I oppose to those in managerial roles with obscene amounts of compensation because it can cost the company its prosperity and discourage other employees . Thus it is recommended for the company to decide on the salaries of executive officers and general workers by adopting a more motivating salary system.This is a good example of an IELTS Band 8 essay. The task statement is sufficiently discussed, and the writer’s arguments are relevant and well developed. There are only 2 body paragraphs, but they are coherent and help to organise the information. Linking words are used appropriately to sequence ideas. Skillful use of synonyms throughout the essay demonstrates the writer’s vocabulary. Some of the expressions used aren’t entirely suitable or accurate, but there aren’t many of them. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.0.;The issue of whether senior managers should have higher salaries than other employees has sparked intense debate in recent years. In many countries, it is a common practice for senior positions to command higher salaries compared to those of young workers within the same company. However, the justification of this pay disparity has been questioned by some, who argue that it is not entirely fair.I agree that senior managers should have higher salaries than other employees. Senior managers typically possess years of experience, extensive knowledge, and a deep understanding of the company's operations. They are responsible for making critical decisions, overseeing complex projects, and driving the company's growth and success. Their expertise and leadership skills are invaluable to the organization, and their compensation should reflect their significant contributions.Moreover, senior managers often bear greater responsibilities and pressures, which can be stressful and demanding. They are accountable for the company's performance, and their decisions can have far-reaching consequences. Given the high stakes and the level of expertise required, it is reasonable to expect that senior managers should be compensated accordingly.In contrast, some people argue that the pay gap between senior managers and other employees is not justified, citing factors such as the rising cost of living and the need for fairness and equality within the company. While these concerns are valid, I believe that the value senior managers bring to the organization warrants their higher salaries. Ultimately, the salaries of senior managers should be commensurate with their experience, skills, and the value they create for the company. By recognizing and rewarding their contributions, companies can attract and retain top talent, driving innovation, growth, and success.
1357;Should employers pay more attention to personal qualities rather than qualifications?;"While recruiting a new employee, the employer should pay more attention to their personal qualities, rather than qualifications and experience. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and include relevant examples.Recent decades have witnessed a burgeoning growth of numerous industries; therefore, recruiting the right person for the position is crucial to the development of enterprises. But how do we determine if a person is the best fit? Advocates of conventional recruitment methods opine that this candidate must have sufficient experience and qualifications needed for that job. Nevertheless, some people argue that candidates’ personal qualities cannot be ignored. In my view, both components are of equal importance.To begin with, the conventional approach of checking potential workers’ qualifications via their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, issued qualifications and certifications from authorised organisations is vital. Apparently, whenever we submit a job application, we are always required to attach a CV while a cover letter is optional. Without a decent qualification, even if that candidate’s personal characteristics are suitable, the enterprise will need to carry out lots of skill trainings eventually.On the other hand, occasionally during an interview some HR officers ignore the significance of assessing how candidates’ individual qualities can fit in the company. Employers should assess not only candidates’ qualifications but also their enabling skills, ethics and value propositions. The more an employee’s personal qualities fit in a company’s culture and values, the more he or she is motivated to contribute to that company’s vision. KPMG is a great example of evaluating candidates’ personal qualifications and skills by utilising a game-based assessment process, followed by a video interview. This methodology enables a comprehensive assessment, and is embraced by many companies nowadays.To summarise, employers should assess both personal characteristics and formal qualifications when recruiting people as each of these elements has its own vital contribution to make in talent-seeking enterprises.This response covers the topic well. The writer’s position is clearly expressed and supported by an example, the use of paragraphing makes this essay organised and easy to follow. Linking words are used appropriately. The use of complex sentences and advanced vocabulary is impressive. Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.";When it comes to recruiting a new employee, the employer should pay more attention to their personal qualities, rather than qualifications and experience. I strongly agree with this statement. While qualifications and experience are essential, personal qualities such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills are equally important for an individual's success in a role.Personal qualities like adaptability, flexibility, and a positive attitude can make a significant difference in an employee's ability to learn, grow, and fit in with the company culture. For instance, a candidate with excellent communication skills can effectively collaborate with colleagues, communicate with clients, and build strong relationships, which is crucial for a company's reputation and success. On the other hand, a candidate with a strong qualification but poor communication skills may struggle to work effectively in a team, leading to decreased productivity and job satisfaction.Moreover, personal qualities like resilience, creativity, and initiative can drive innovation and progress in a company. An employee with these qualities can think outside the box, identify new opportunities, and take calculated risks, leading to business growth and expansion. For example, companies like Google and Amazon prioritize personal qualities like innovation and creativity, which has enabled them to stay ahead of the competition and achieve remarkable success.In conclusion, while qualifications and experience are important, personal qualities are equally crucial for an employee's success. Employers should pay more attention to personal qualities like teamwork, communication, and problem-solving skills, as they can make a significant difference in an employee's ability to learn, grow, and contribute to the company's success. By prioritizing personal qualities, employers can build a strong, innovative, and productive team that drives business growth and achievement.
1385;Should people spend a lot on weddings and birthday parties?;"Some people think that spending a lot on holding wedding parties, birthday parties and other celebrations is just a waste of money. Others, however, think that these are necessary for individuals and the society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Throwing parties can be expensive. While some people do not find these fancy gatherings worth what they cost, others believe such events are important to both individuals and the society.People choose to throw parties for a number of reasons. For starters, they can make better teams. Project kick-off parties are good opportunities to break the ice and help team members to know each other better. Celebrating a victory create a sense of success and belonging. Companies do not see parties as of money and allocate budget to support such events; moreover, they often leave good memories. From our own experiences, we all have happy memories of our birthday parties when we were little. Every family has great photos at family gatherings in their album. In addition, contrary to what some people believe that spending on parties is a waste of social resources, they actually create value, either by employing people in the party-planning business or by offering people better experiences.The popularity of parties, however, causes some tension in the society. They are hard on introverted people who find themselves uncomfortable in the crowd. This is a clinic symptom which psychologists call “social anxiety disorder”. There are other ways to celebrate important events that may have greater value for their cost. For instance, companies could send out gifts after successful projects and parents could take their children on family trips to celebrate birthdays.In my opinion, while a party is a form of social event that brings many benefits to individuals and the society, other choices should also be considered, either to cut spending or to relieve the stress of those who are not fond of crowded celebrations.This is a very good essay. Other than minor inaccuracies there are no problems (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). Seems to be worth IELTS Band 8.";The question of whether people should spend a lot on weddings and birthday parties has sparked a heated debate. On one hand, some people think that spending a substantial amount on holding wedding parties, birthday parties, and other celebrations is just a waste of money. They argue that such expenses are frivolous and could be better spent on more practical and essential needs. For instance, the money spent on lavish parties could be used to pay off debts, invest in education, or even donated to charitable causes. Moreover, extravagant celebrations can lead to financial burdens and stress, which may outweigh the temporary joy and excitement they bring.On the other hand, others believe that these celebrations are necessary for individuals and society. They see weddings and birthday parties as significant milestones that mark important life events, fostering social bonding, creating lasting memories, and strengthening family and community ties. These occasions allow people to come together, share happiness, and reinforce social relationships, which are essential for emotional well-being and a sense of belonging. Additionally, the wedding and party industries provide employment opportunities and contribute to the economy, which can have a positive impact on the community.In my opinion, while it is essential to acknowledge the economic and practical aspects of spending on celebrations, I believe that moderate spending on weddings and birthday parties can have profound social and emotional benefits. A balanced approach that considers both the financial implications and the value of creating memorable experiences with loved ones is crucial. Rather than spending excessively, individuals should prioritize what truly matters to them and allocate their resources accordingly, ensuring that these celebrations bring joy without leading to financial distress. Ultimately, the decision on how much to spend should reflect a thoughtful consideration of personal values, financial stability, and the true significance of these life events.
1393;Should the same laws which prohibit the sale and consumption of heroin be applied to tobacco? Discuss.;Recently, a heated debate when a few reputable health organizations suggested the application of a similar act of heroin selling and usage prohibition . In this , I will analyze why the adoption of such a law could be a breakthrough in our youngsters’ safety, according to my vision.Firstly, tobacco does not differ much from heroin when it comes to the addictive effect. , the active ingredient in tobacco, exerts its effect by acting directly on smoker’s brain cells. Numerous experiments carried out by on animals, rats, proved that this toxic chemical does lead time to dependency, similarly to the effect experienced with .Secondly, the restriction on selling would surely show an instant decline in tobacco smoking. ” Having easy access to cigarettes puts a tremendous pressure, especially on teenagers,to resist such a temptation” Dr.Hisham , head of department at Alexandria Medical college , states firmly. “Giving the new generation the sense that the severity of smoking is to other lethal drugs usage be a life saving step, they will thank us for as they get older.” he continues.To recapitulate, applying of a futuristic law such as the suggested one will have a positive impact ,not only on young people’s health but on our society as a whole.;The question of whether the same laws that prohibit the sale and consumption of heroin should be applied to tobacco is a complex and debated issue. Some argue that tobacco, although highly addictive and harmful, is a legal substance and therefore should not be subjected to the same laws as illicit drugs like heroin. However, a few reputable health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Cancer Society, have suggested that the application of a similar act to prohibit the sale and usage of tobacco could have significant health benefits.The reasoning behind this proposal is that tobacco use is a major public health concern, responsible for millions of deaths worldwide each year. Similar to heroin, it is highly addictive and can lead to serious health problems, including lung cancer, heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). By restricting the sale of tobacco products, it is likely that there would be an instant decline in tobacco smoking, as the availability and accessibility of these products would be severely limited. This, in turn, could lead to a significant reduction in tobacco-related illnesses and deaths.Moreover, the restriction on selling tobacco would also have a positive impact on public health education and prevention efforts. It would send a strong message that tobacco use is a serious health risk and that it is not acceptable to engage in this behavior. Additionally, the resources currently spent on tobacco control and treatment could be redirected towards other public health priorities. While some may argue that such a move would be an overreach of government authority, the potential benefits to public health make a strong case for considering stricter regulations on tobacco sales and use. Ultimately, the goal should be to protect public health, and if applying laws similar to those for heroin can achieve this, then it is an option worth exploring.
1394;Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth with poorer nations by providing them with things such as food and education? Or is this the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens?;I think that wealthy nations should be required to share their wealth with poorer nations. at providing such things as food and education because of the three following reasons.Firstly, citizens of both wealthy nations and poorer nations are human beings. Therefore, we can not look at, hear of, or talk about people who lack food, education, without compassion and sympathy. Sharing wealth with poorer nations is not only a good deed but is also a .Secondly, many nations in Africa and Asia are poor. Famine, diseases, crime and illiteracy are killing the citizens of these countries. , many nations in Europe and America are rich. If there are no actions taken, this inequality will increase dramatically. Poor countries will become poorer while rich countries will become richer. As a result, the poorest countries will become slaves of the richest countries. So, sharing wealth is useful way to prevent people from that bad future.Thirdly, although sharing wealth with poorer nations is very necessarythis help should only stop at providing such things as food, medicine and education. Or else, poor nations may become dependent on the aid. They may lose enthusiasm to build their countries by themselves. Moreover, rich nations can take advantage of sharing wealth to interfere with the governance of poor nations’. This can’t be considered a humane action and should be prevented.In my opinion, sharing wealth with poorer nations has both a bad side and a good side. What we have to do is its bad side and its good side.;The debate on whether wealthy nations should share their wealth with poorer nations has been ongoing for years. In my opinion, wealthy nations should be required to share their wealth with poorer nations by providing them with essential necessities such as food and education. There are several compelling reasons that support this stance.Firstly, citizens of both wealthy nations and poor nations are human beings, deserving of the same basic rights and dignity. Sharing wealth is not only a good deed but is also a moral obligation. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that every individual, regardless of their nationality, has access to the basic necessities of life. By providing food and education, wealthy nations can help alleviate suffering and promote a better quality of life for the citizens of poorer nations.Secondly, many nations in Africa and Asia are struggling with poverty, and the consequences are devastating. Famine, diseases, crime, and illiteracy are killing the citizens of these countries, and it is our duty to act. By sharing their wealth, wealthy nations can help these countries to develop their infrastructure, improve their healthcare systems, and provide education to their citizens. This, in turn, can help to break the cycle of poverty and promote economic growth.Lastly, sharing wealth can also have long-term benefits for wealthy nations themselves. A more stable and prosperous world can lead to increased global trade, economic growth, and security. Therefore, it is not only a moral obligation but also a pragmatic decision for wealthy nations to share their wealth with poorer nations. In conclusion, wealthy nations have a responsibility to share their wealth with poorer nations, and it is essential that we take collective action to address the pressing issues of poverty, hunger, and lack of education that plague many parts of the world.
1302;Social media has become a real problem for some young people today, and governments should create laws that allow only people over 18 years of age to have accounts.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Social media today is extremely significant to a majority of the population, especially the younger generation. Many teenagers find it exceptionally convenient and necessary for communication and entertainment. However, not everyone is able to use social media responsibly, which gave rise to the idea of making it accessible to only those older than eighteen years of age.Though there are negatives, such as cyber-bullying, or being too distracted by these modern media, there are issues surrounding most things in life. It is a choice to go onto a social media website, and many younger people are capable of managing accounts without any difficulties. It is not the government’s responsibility to monitor under eighteen-year olds; that is for the parents.Statistics show that over eighty per cent of teens use a form of online social media. It allows them to chat online, easily stay in contact with friends and family across the world, and see updates on others’ lives (through text, photos or videos). Social media is a way to express thoughts or ideas and to stay in contact with the rest of the world.To not permit one of the largest Internet-using demographics to use social media because a few people have problems with it is an irrational and an unfair restriction. Not only would profit be lost with fewer users, but controlling who creates accounts and monitoring proof of age would be difficult as well. I believe that laws should not make social media inaccessible to young people under eighteen; this would be unnecessary and absurd.";The proliferation of social media has undoubtedly become a staple of modern life, with its significance being particularly pronounced among the younger generation. Social media today is extremely significant to a majority of the population, especially the younger generation, who use these platforms to connect with peers, share experiences, and access a wealth of information. However, not everyone is able to use social media responsibly, which has given rise to the idea of making it accessible to only those older than eighteen years of age. This proposal suggests that governments should create laws that restrict social media accounts to individuals over 18 years old, in an effort to mitigate the potential negative impacts associated with its misuse.While I understand the concerns that have led to this suggestion, I partially disagree with the idea of blanket age restrictions on social media access. The primary argument against such laws is that they could unfairly deprive younger individuals of the numerous benefits that social media offers, including educational resources, social support networks, and platforms for creative expression. Moreover, restricting access based solely on age oversimplifies the complex issues surrounding social media use, such as cyberbullying, misinformation, and addiction, which can affect users of all ages.Instead of age-based restrictions, I believe that a more effective approach would involve educating users of all ages about responsible social media use, enhancing platform moderation to detect and prevent harmful activities, and implementing stricter privacy and safety measures. This way, the benefits of social media can be preserved while minimizing its risks. Furthermore, parents, educators, and the social media companies themselves have roles to play in ensuring that young people use these platforms safely and responsibly. By adopting a multifaceted strategy that includes education, moderation, and regulation, we can promote healthy social media habits without excluding younger users, who stand to gain significantly from the positive aspects of social media engagement.
771;Society is based on rules and laws. If individuals were free to do whatever they want to do, it could not function. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?;It is commonly held that society can operate perfectly by a set of rules. It means that providing total freedom to people undoubtedly results in chaos with the further possibility of total collapse. I strongly agree with this point of view as I am in the opinion that rules play a significant role in creating a stable society. In this essay, this idea will be discussed in detail.Basically, a set of rules can be helpful to achieve productive results in such essential areas as medicine and construction. For example, it is necessary to develop common procedures of operations in surgery or traffic rules for public transport. Unless there are not standardized, it might cause a lot of deaths or at least injuries. Constructing also should be based on common processes because comfort and safe accommodation is a necessity for many people. Although there are people who consider rules and laws limiting and imposing, it can be argued that they are critical in the organization of humanity.Laws are not obstacles on the way to people's freedom because they are established to regulate formal relationships when it is difficult to find a compromise informally. Moreover, they are vitally important when people face crime and violence. Without any system of justice solving crimes becomes more challenging. All criminal accidents tend to be out of control and spread around the world immediately. Shoplifting, robbery, and even disastrous wars can plunge our world into darkness. This way humanity might face total chaos where morals values and behavioral patterns are neglected. In this context, the word ‘society’ risks becoming totally meaningless, as its main definition is a 'group of people with common traditions and rules.'From the arguments presented above, one may conclude that any society needs standards, laws, or even moral principles. They form a foundation for safety, a good level of medicine, and science that allows to create a strong society and manage any difficulties or threats that may disturb people’s well-being.;The statement that society is based on rules and laws and that individuals need to be restricted in order to function is a notion that has sparked debate among scholars and philosophers. While some argue that rules and laws stifle individual freedom, I agree that a set of rules is necessary for a society to operate efficiently.A set of rules can be highly beneficial in achieving productive results in essential areas such as medicine and construction. For instance, in the medical field, strict guidelines ensure that healthcare professionals provide standardized care, resulting in better patient outcomes. Similarly, in construction, rules and regulations guarantee that buildings are designed and erected with safety and durability in mind. Without these rules, the quality and reliability of these services would be compromised, posing a risk to public health and safety.Although there are people who consider rules and laws limiting and imposing, it can be argued that they are critical in the organization of humanity. Laws are not obstacles on the way to people's freedom because they are established to regulate formal relationships, ensuring that individuals' rights are protected and that social order is maintained. In fact, laws provide a framework for social cohesion, allowing individuals to live and work together in a harmonious and respectful manner.In conclusion, while some may view rules and laws as restrictive, they are essential for a functioning society. By establishing a set of guidelines and regulations, we can ensure that essential areas such as medicine and construction operate efficiently, and that social relationships are organized in a way that promotes harmony and respect. Ultimately, rules and laws are the foundation upon which a well-organized and productive society is built, and their importance cannot be overstated.
1398;Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree that this is the right course of action? Give reasons for your opinion.;, organization and companies as well as governments impose restrictions in work places and public amenities. It has become fashionable in the world today . I feel that smoking can be harmful, but I don’t think it should be forbidden completely. I would also argue that people should have the whether or not they should smoke.Allow me to present the three positive sides of smoking. Firstly, smoking certainly helps many people to relax. For some, it even improves concentration. If someone is upset or they have , to smoke to reduce the pressure or tension. people like to smoke when they are relaxing with friends. Secondly, governments throughout the world make huge profits from taxes on cigarettes. The income obtained through taxes provides funds which are used for building and public places such as parks, gardens, sports ground and foot paths. Thirdly, tobacco industry also employs tens of thousands of people all over the world, particularly in poorer countries such as Zimbabwe or the Philippines. Without cigarettes, these people would have no jobs.Despite these positive are lots of negative effects to smoking too. Initially, smoking has been proven to be very dangerous for health. cigarette contains more than 4000 chemical substances, therefore, it dangerous diseases such as heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis or lung cancer. According to a recent report in Britain close to 3,500 people are killed each year in road accidents and 120,000 are killed by smoking. Furthermore, smoking costs governments millions of dollars because of the large number of people who need treatment in hospitals for smoking-related problems. Moreover, passive smoking is also a major concern today. Recent research shows that non-smokers can suffer from health problems if they spend long periods of time among people who do smoke. In the UK children whose parents are are three times as likely to start smoking themselves .In short, I think the world would be a better place without cigarettes. However, the decision of whether smoke or not to smoke should be for each individual to make. I suggest that people should not smoke in a room or a place where there are non smokers, however they should be free to smoke elsewhere.;The debate on whether smoking should be prohibited in public places has been ongoing for years. In my opinion, I strongly agree that banning smoking in public places is the right course of action. The main reason for this is that cigarettes contain more than 4000 chemical substances, many of which are toxic and can cause dangerous diseases such as heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis, and lung cancer. By allowing smoking in public places, we are not only putting the health of smokers at risk but also exposing non-smokers to the harmful effects of second-hand smoke.Furthermore, smoking is a habit that can be passed down to future generations. For instance, in the UK, children whose parents smoke are three times as likely to start smoking themselves. This cycle of smoking can be broken by prohibiting smoking in public places, thereby reducing the visibility and appeal of smoking to young people. By banning smoking in public places, governments and businesses can play a crucial role in reducing the number of smokers and promoting a healthier lifestyle.Additionally, prohibiting smoking in public places can also improve the overall quality of life for non-smokers. It can reduce the unpleasant smell and smoke that non-smokers are often forced to endure in public places. Overall, the benefits of banning smoking in public places far outweigh any potential drawbacks. It is a necessary step towards creating a healthier and more considerate society. Therefore, I firmly believe that governments and businesses should continue to prohibit smoking in public places to protect public health and promote a smoke-free environment.
665;Some cities create housing areas by providing taller buildings. Others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. What solution is better?;Some big cities, especially in Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama in Japan tend to build taller buildings like skyscrapers. Other local cities and places where are scarcely populated are built wider. This is quite understandable in terms of space, and there might be some solutions to dissipate populations around Japan.Initially, the main reason why people tend to gather in big cities is that there are many opportunities to get a job. There are famous headquarter companies and branches that are based in foreign countries. Therefore, more and more people move to the big cities so that many taller apartments and buildings are built to let them live in the limited space. There seems to be stressful due to people being densely populated, but infrastructures are well organized, especially transport, medical care, and security.In contrast, the population in the countryside becomes less. Therefore, there is plenty of space to build houses in the wider area. It seems to be well-relaxed and comfortable to live in a slow-paced lifestyle. But, it is apparently more difficult to obtain a new job, and lacking transport, so they need to rely on cars. In addition, the number of hospitals is much smaller than big cities. These issues are long controversial as a first world problem.Finally, as Covid-19 spread worldwide, many people are started to work at home with a lap top computer. Innumerable companies adopted IT systems that are able to work remotely. In addition, some companies had already stated this systemized working style will not change, however, Covid-19 completely ended. This means that many people do not necessarily need to live in big cities. Therefore, if the transport system is well organized, especially establishing and improving a train, which works faster and more frequently. This effort will be not only helpful to dissipate the population outside of the big cities, but also promotive to tackling with great infrastructures to countrysides.In conclusion, as a result, the densely populated cities will be able to reduce its population and increase the population in the countryside. As a result, some issues will be resolved and become well-balanced solutions. Finally, it might be able to build wider houses in big cities with reasonable prices than now.;The issue of housing is a pressing concern for many cities around the world. As the population continues to grow, cities are faced with the challenge of providing adequate housing for their residents. Two common solutions to this problem are building taller buildings, such as skyscrapers, and constructing houses on a wider area of land. In this essay, we will discuss which solution is better.Some big cities, especially in Japan, such as Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama, tend to build taller buildings like skyscrapers to accommodate their large populations. This approach has several advantages, including minimizing the use of land and reducing the strain on urban infrastructure. Additionally, taller buildings can provide stunning views and a unique living experience. However, this approach can also lead to overcrowding and increased costs of living.In contrast, the population in the countryside is often decreasing, resulting in plenty of space to build houses on a wider area of land. This approach has its own set of advantages, including providing more space and a quieter living environment. It also allows for more freedom to design and build houses according to individual preferences. Moreover, building houses on a wider area of land can help to preserve the natural environment and reduce the urbanization of rural areas.In conclusion, both solutions have their own merits and demerits. While building taller buildings can provide a unique living experience and minimize land use, building houses on a wider area of land can provide more space and a quieter living environment. Ultimately, the better solution depends on the specific needs and circumstances of each city. However, it is worth noting that building houses on a wider area of land can be a more sustainable and environmentally friendly option, especially in areas where the population is decreasing.
11;Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Athletes to be on the top need to have high-end facilities that a country can provide for them to be able to improve their strengths and skills. Some government opted to build facilities exclusively for training athletes for international sports goals, instead of building establishments for everyone to have the liberty of using the sports facilities. From my perspective, this phenomena is a negative development.Being able to discover an individual's potential, they need to have a support from any form of sources. Establishing sports facilities can help people to discover their own interests, talents and even skills in learning new things. Centers which offer utilities, equipments and state-of-the-art tools that provide learning sports can be a great advantage to people who want to train themselves on the things that can awaken their interests when it comes to sports.In addition, building these kind of establishments, not only for the purpose to train top athletes, but also for people to immerse themselves to different variaties of activities can help them socialize more with their peers. This is extremely beneficial that aside from doing sports that they are into, they get to play along with peers, discover one's potential and also learning from one another. Furthermore, these individuals can also have the future to be one of top athletes that a country can have.In conclusion, although there are countries that chose to have their sports establishments exclusively for training top athletes, I assert that these that actions can be lead to negative feedbacks. Government should allow everyone the privilege to use and avail facilities that can hone an individual's talents, skills and dexterity when it comes to sports and this can also be immensely benefical for both country and citizen alike.;The pursuit of international sports excellence has led some countries to adopt a strategy of building specialized facilities to train top athletes, rather than providing sports facilities for the general public. This approach has sparked a debate about its merits. On one hand, it can be argued that this development is positive. Athletes who aspire to be at the top of their game need to have access to high-end facilities that a country can provide, in order to improve their strengths and skills. These state-of-the-art facilities can offer advanced training equipment, expert coaching, and a competitive environment that can help athletes hone their talents and achieve international success.On the other hand, some critics argue that this approach is negative, as it prioritizes the interests of a select few over the needs of the broader community. Some governments have opted to build facilities exclusively for training athletes for international sports goals, rather than building establishments that everyone can use. This can lead to a sense of exclusivity and deprivation among the general public, who may feel that their recreational and fitness needs are being neglected. Moreover, it can also undermine the potential for grassroots sports development, as limited access to facilities can discourage people from participating in sports and developing their talents.In my opinion, while the goal of achieving international sports success is commendable, it should not come at the expense of the broader community's needs. A balanced approach that provides both specialized facilities for top athletes and accessible sports infrastructure for the general public would be more desirable. This would not only help to nurture athletic talent but also promote a culture of physical activity and sports participation among the population at large. Ultimately, a country's sports development strategy should aim to strike a balance between elite performance and community engagement.
725;Some educationalists say that every child should be taught how to play a musical instrument. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;It is commonly known that music has always played an important role in upbringing of children and a lot of parents wish their kids play a musical instrument. However, I disagree that this skill is essential to every pupil.First of all, not all people are born with a talent for music, which is essential if one wants to learn how to play it. Some people are natural musicians and succeed in this sphere with ease. On the other hand, there are children for whom learning to play is a hard work and, eventually, they might start hating music instead of enjoying it. Some people are bound to become excellent engineers or doctors and for them learning to read and play music is just a waste of time.Another important factor is that all kids are different and for that reason each of them desires to have a different hobby. If all pupils spent time on music, those who are not interested in it would have less time on things that are really exciting for them. Undoubtedly, everybody has a right to spend their free time in the way they want.What is more, playing a musical instrument is not considered to be an essential skill for a successful career. More time should be devoted to more important subjects, such as Math, Science and Languages. These have more chance to be useful for people when they grow up and graduate from school.To sum up, teaching all children to play an instrument wouldn't be a good idea. It should be taught only to those who really want it as not only would it ditract a child from subjects and hobbies which are more important in their opinion, but also it cannot be mastered by everybody.;The idea that every child should be taught how to play a musical instrument has sparked a heated debate among educationalists. While some argue that learning a musical instrument is essential for a child's development, I partially disagree with this statement. Firstly, not all people are born with a talent for music, which is essential if one wants to learn how to play it. Forcing a child to learn a musical instrument without any innate ability can lead to frustration and a negative experience, ultimately deterring them from pursuing music altogether. Furthermore, playing a musical instrument is not considered to be an essential skill for a successful career, which is often the primary focus of education.In addition, the already packed school curriculum leaves little room for additional subjects. More time should be devoted to more important subjects, such as Math, Science, and Languages, which are crucial for a child's future academic and professional success. These subjects lay the foundation for a wide range of careers and are essential for a child's cognitive development. In contrast, music, although beneficial, can be explored through extracurricular activities or external classes, allowing children to pursue their interest in music without compromising their academic priorities.In conclusion, while learning a musical instrument can be beneficial for a child's development, I believe that it should not be a compulsory part of the school curriculum. Instead, schools should focus on the core subjects and allow children to explore their interest in music through external means. This approach will ensure that children receive a well-rounded education and are not forced to dedicate time to a subject that may not be essential for their future success.
73;Some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The thought of some experts, is that people from rich countries are not satisfied by an ipotetical increase in their economy. In this essay I will discuss this point of view and I will explain why I am not sure I agree with that.It is generally believed by some professional figures, that additionals rise in economic wealth are not so crucial for a rich coutry. People from countries sush as Japan, the U.S.A, Switzerland or Cina are aware of their wide economic power and these governments offer a lot of benefits for their citizens. Thus, people have yet what they want, such as fundings for projects, well-organized cities, a lot of job opportunities. In fact, they do not fell a significant sense of satisfaction in the increase of their economy.Made this point, it is also true that some surveys used by The Italian University of Parma, reveal that citizens from coutries which a strong economy, are really grateful and satisfied by any additional rise, in the economic sector. As consequence due to this increase, they can ask more fundings for some start up or to improve the technology equipment in schools. Personally, I tend to think as a matter of fact that this is the right view. Because it is logical that more money mean more opportunities in any sector of the country. Hospitals, schools, museum and even historical buildings can have the possibility to obteind a lot of benefits.To conclude, in this essay I discuss the generel view of some experts about people from rich countries. I also explained why I strongly disagree with them.;The notion that additional economic wealth does not necessarily lead to greater satisfaction among citizens of already rich countries is a topic of debate. Some experts believe that people from rich countries are not satisfied by an increase in their economy, suggesting that once basic needs are met, the correlation between wealth and happiness weakens. In this essay, I will discuss this point of view and explain why I am not sure I agree with that.On one hand, it is understandable that a certain level of economic stability is required for individuals to feel secure and content. Once this threshold is reached, the incremental benefits of further wealth may indeed diminish. Citizens of rich countries often have their basic needs met and may prioritize other aspects of life, such as personal relationships, health, and leisure activities, over material wealth. Therefore, it is plausible that an increase in economic wealth may not significantly impact their overall satisfaction.On the other hand, I am not entirely convinced by this argument. Economic growth can lead to improvements in public services, infrastructure, and innovation, which can enhance the overall quality of life. Furthermore, increased wealth can provide individuals with more opportunities for personal growth, travel, and exploration, which can contribute to a greater sense of fulfillment. Additionally, the concept of satisfaction is highly subjective and can vary greatly from person to person, making it challenging to generalize the impact of economic growth on happiness.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the perspective that additional economic wealth may not lead to greater satisfaction in rich countries, I remain uncertain about the validity of this claim. The relationship between wealth and happiness is complex, and individual experiences can differ significantly. Further research and consideration of the various factors that influence satisfaction are necessary to fully understand the impact of economic growth on the well-being of citizens in rich countries.
1061;Some museums and art galleries charge admission fees, while others have free entry.Do you think the advantages of charging for admission outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many artistic places prefer to have an entry fee, whereas others let free access. I fully think that the benefits to have admission fees compensate the drawbacks to be not free.Many individuals would visit museum or art galleries if it were free which could attract more tourists. Unfortunately, admission charge decreases the possibility to discover paintings or masterpieces. However, before being a cultural place, art galleries are a place where numerous employees work. Indeed, if visitors had not to purchase the entrance, workforce would be not paid and the place would be not clean as museum should be. Moreover, huge museums as the British Museum have some sponsors to restore masterpieces whereas small museums have sometimes not the fundings and hence, admission fees would help it. Then, having an entry fee limit the number of individuals who do not really want to see art and appreciate the place.Concerning to cultural places, museum and art galleries know that many households could not afford ticket entrances for their offspring so many museums establish reduced price for teenagers and children. This project improves the relation between young people and the culture, then it allows children to be attracted to culture, partipate to the technical expenses behind the entry fee and after to visit again some cultural places when they will grow up and purchase the full price. Moreover, purchasing tickets help to the economy of the country which sometimes famous cultural places are a significant part of country's income. For instance, admission fees in museum are two third of the tourism's outcome in France.To conclude, I believe that admission fees should outweigh free entrance because it does not let the worth process of museum to work. Even if sometimes admission fees are costly for us, there is always a meaning behind the prices.;The debate about whether museums and art galleries should charge admission fees has been ongoing for years. While some institutions prefer to have an entry fee, others offer free access to the public. In my opinion, the disadvantages of charging for admission outweigh the advantages. On the one hand, many artistic places prefer to have an entry fee as it provides them with a steady income stream, which can be used to maintain and improve their facilities. However, on the other hand, many individuals would visit museums or art galleries if it were free. This is because people are more likely to explore and discover new artistic experiences if they do not have to pay for it. For instance, the National Museum in my country offers free admission on Sundays, and as a result, it is always packed with visitors who would not have otherwise visited.Unfortunately, admission charges decrease the possibility to discover paintings or masterpieces. Many people, especially students and low-income individuals, cannot afford to pay the admission fees and are therefore denied access to these cultural institutions. This not only limits their exposure to art and culture but also hinders their ability to learn and appreciate the masterpieces that are on display. For example, the famous Louvre Museum in Paris charges a significant admission fee, which deters many potential visitors from exploring its vast collection of art, including the Mona Lisa.In conclusion, while charging admission fees may provide museums and art galleries with a source of income, it also limits the number of people who can visit and appreciate the art and culture that they have to offer. I believe that free access to these institutions is essential in promoting art, culture, and education, and that alternative sources of funding should be explored to make this possible.
1355;Some parents encourage young people to leave home while others think they should stay with the family, discuss and give your opinion;Many parents encourage young people to leave home when they become older, while others think they should stay at home with the family. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.With the tremendous influence of modernisation, remarkable changes have taken place in the family structure to such an extent that nowadays, youngsters are motivated by their parents to live alone as they grow up. However, some people are of the view that it is more practical for a youngster to live with their family.On the one hand, there are many positive aspects to youths living away from their parents at young age. This provides the opportunity to young people to live a life on their own terms and make any decisions without the interference of their parents. Besides, living alone not only makes them independent but also makes them self-reliant, which is a crucial life skill to their successful career. For instance, managing all the house chores such as cleaning, paying bills, cooking and so on will make them well experienced at learning and managing diverse activities and will also boost their confidence.On the other hand, there is no denying the fact that youngsters living away from their family may find themselves in circumstances that may adversely affect their life. Naïve and inexperienced young people in the absence of parental supervision are more likely to fall prey to bad influence and dangerous activities, such as drugs or alcohol consumption, which may jeopardise their career or lead them astray from moral values. However, this situation is less likely to take place with youngsters still living with their parents. Besides, emotional bonding and family relationships can be maintained better if everyone is living together under one roof.In my opinion, although encouraging youngsters to live alone may lead them to learn various life skills, negative aspects and risks associated with living alone can far outweigh the benefits.This response covers the task topic well, by discussing the positive and negative aspects of living alone as a young adult, and the writer’s opinion has also been included. Paragraphing helps to present ideas in an orderly way, and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay. There is some repetitive use of the word ‘make’ in the first body paragraph, which could have been avoided. Apart from that, the writer’s vocabulary seems to be quite rich and allows them to communicate ideas precisely and clearly. Overall, this essay seems to be worthy of IELTS Band 8.;The debate about whether young people should leave home or stay with their family has sparked intense discussion among parents. While some parents encourage their children to become independent and leave home when they become older, others believe that staying at home with the family is the best option. On the one hand, there are many positive aspects to youths living away from their parents at a young age. Living alone not only makes them independent but also makes them self-reliant, which is a crucial life skill for their successful career. By living away from home, young people are forced to take responsibility for their daily needs, manage their finances, and make decisions on their own. This independence and self-reliance can be beneficial in the long run, as it prepares them for the challenges of the real world. On the other hand, some parents believe that their children should stay at home with the family. They argue that emotional bonding and family relationships can be maintained better if everyone is living together under one roof. This close-knit family environment provides a sense of security, love, and support, which is essential for the emotional well-being of young people. Additionally, staying at home can also be cost-effective, as young people do not have to worry about paying rent, utilities, and other expenses associated with living alone.In my opinion, I believe that leaving home at a young age can be beneficial for young people, as it helps them develop essential life skills, such as independence and self-reliance. However, this decision ultimately depends on the individual's personality, maturity level, and circumstances. Some young people may be ready to take on the responsibilities of living alone, while others may need more time to develop these skills. Ultimately, parents should consider their child's unique needs and personality when deciding whether they should leave home or stay with the family.
1335;Some people believe that excessive use of modern technologies, such as computers and smartphones, is negatively affecting the reading and writing skills of our young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Parents and teachers in many countries are feeling increasingly concerned about the effect of digital devices on vital skills of school-aged children. They are alarmed by the declining ability of young people to read and write and its suspected link to the influence of modern technology, and I wholeheartedly share their view. This essay will outline the reasons to watch out for the consequences of widespread use of computers and mobile phones by our youngsters.Primary school is a very important period when children develop their fine motor skills, which are involved in learning to write. Time spent typing on a mobile phone or a tablet doesn’t contribute to the necessary workout of the small muscles in the hands and fingers of young people. Not only do they get less practice in writing but also fewer opportunities to train in spelling words, since the ‘autocorrect’ and ‘autocomplete’ features use the first few letters to guess the entire word, therefore making it unnecessary for the child to remember and type it correctly. Another companion of unrestrained use of mobile devices is the jargon that is often used in text messages, where words are shortened or distorted. Exposure to ‘texting’ tends to replace the correct words with abbreviations in young minds, causing their spelling accuracy to decline.Reading is another casualty of unrestricted access to smart devices. Video content can be more appealing and immersive for kids and they often are automatically drawn to it instead of books. Reading requires regular practice and needs to become a habit in order to fully develop as a skill; however, it is being perceived as a boring and labourious activity by many youngsters compared to effortless video-watching. Easy and instant access to videos and movies pushes books further down the list of preferences of young audience, and it takes a significant commitment from parents and teachers to ensure that children continue to read books.To sum up, modern technology can be a friend or a foe for young children, depending on the choices adults in their lives make, regulating the amount of screen time and its purpose. Without due care the writing and reading abilities of kids can be harmed by other, more enjoyable activities they can use the devices for.";The excessive use of modern technologies, such as computers and smartphones, has sparked a heated debate about its impact on the reading and writing skills of young people. I strongly agree that the over-reliance on digital devices is having a detrimental effect on these vital skills. Parents and teachers are feeling increasingly concerned about the effect of digital devices on the vital skills of school-aged children. One of the primary concerns is that the time spent typing on a mobile phone or a tablet doesn’t contribute to the necessary workout of the small muscles in the hands and fingers of young people, which are essential for writing and other fine motor skills. As a result, many children are struggling with handwriting and are less likely to develop the dexterity and coordination needed for writing.Reading is another casualty of unrestricted access to smart devices. With the constant stream of information available on digital platforms, many young people are opting for bite-sized, easily digestible content rather than engaging with more substantial written material. This not only hinders their reading skills but also limits their exposure to complex vocabulary, syntax, and literary devices. Furthermore, the constant distraction of notifications and social media can reduce the attention span of young people, making it even more challenging for them to focus on reading and writing tasks.In conclusion, I firmly believe that excessive use of modern technologies is negatively affecting the reading and writing skills of our young people. It is essential for parents, teachers, and policymakers to take steps to mitigate this issue, such as promoting a balanced use of technology and encouraging traditional reading and writing practices. By doing so, we can ensure that our young people develop the essential skills needed to succeed in their academic and professional lives.
379;Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;This essay agrees on the need of that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities, but always under one premise: those students should have demonstrated their capability to comply with university studies successfully.There are countries, for example Scandinavian countries, where their government helps students by giving them specific students' loans. These loans have special characteristics such as long loan terms and low interest rates. It is not for free, but at least a higher number of students can have access to upgrade their studies.And in many other European countries university fees are not large, so most of the students can access to bachelor studies. What it's not easy is having the needed qualification you need to access to the specific university study you want.If we talk in worlwide terms, university studies are limited to wealthy people.In fact I read only a couple of weeks ago that only a 17% of worlds' population have university studies. There is a contradiction between developped and non developped countries. As an example, in most countries in Europe we have too many university students. Actually they cannot find a job easily at their own country and sometimes they emigrate to another country in Europe or outside Europe. Furthermore vocational workers such as plumbers, waiters or receptionists can't be found, there no unemployment in vocational work!.The opposite happens in non developped countries. As university studies have large fees, almost nobody can access to them, and vocational workers suffer unemployment, so they need to emigrate to other countries to find jobs.To summarize, I believe fees should not be an obstacle to study in a university. The obstable should be your previous califications.Education and Health, as much as a country can hold them, should be available for all population, poor and wealthy, with non differentiation.;The notion that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities has sparked intense debate. While some argue that it is the government's responsibility to provide free education, I agree with this statement, but with a crucial condition. Governments should pay full course fees, but only for students who have demonstrated their capability to comply with university studies successfully.This condition is essential to ensure that the investment in education is productive and effective. Students who have shown academic promise and a strong work ethic should be supported to pursue higher education, as they are more likely to make the most of this opportunity. By doing so, governments can foster a talented and skilled workforce, which can contribute to the country's economic growth and development.Furthermore, if we consider the issue in worldwide terms, university studies are often limited to wealthy individuals. This creates a significant barrier to social mobility and exacerbates inequality. By covering full course fees, governments can provide equal opportunities for students from all backgrounds to access higher education. This, in turn, can help bridge the gap between the privileged and underprivileged, promoting a more equitable society.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments for and against governments paying full course fees for university students, I firmly believe that they should do so, but only for students who have demonstrated their academic capabilities. This approach can ensure that education is accessible to all, regardless of their financial means, and that the investment in education yields the best possible outcomes for individuals and society as a whole.
1428;Some people believe that having a pet such as a cat or a dog helps old people to live a more enjoyable life and to stay healthier. How do you think old people benefit from having a pet? Do you think there are any problems related to old people who have pets?;, and indeed, the importance of relationship between human beings and their pets has been proved to be slightly exaggerated in some nations. However, although problems regarding may affect the health conditions of old people, the benefits that these lovely animals bring to them, physically and mentally alike, are clearly undeniable.In of physical benefits, the well-being of elderly people with pets compared to those without pets, since not only do they have to take care of themselves, the responsibility ensure their one fed and well looked after encourages them to become even more active. Due to these extra activities, this might not have an obvious influence on their health, but at least this could help them to avoid bad . Coupled with physical side, their mental wellbeing will also be improved, and the reason is that having someone to take care of would reduce the chance of feeling . Therefore, their could be minimised.In spite of the above advantages, the interaction between pets and vulnerable old people still exist. One of the major concerns is the of these animal on their tracheas, especially those asthma. virtually invisible in the air, many asthma symptoms are caused unconsciously by pets. In addition to the fact that old people might experience difficulty in looking after their pets, as their health conditions are limited, could become even more when they try take care of others.In conclusion, it is true that obstacles still exist for elderly people in adopting pets, but the benefits of this topic its . For such reasons, instead of , further support would be far more beneficial.;As people age, they often experience a decline in physical and mental health, as well as social isolation. However, having a pet such as a cat or a dog can significantly improve their quality of life. The benefits that these lovely animals bring to them, physically and mentally alike, are clearly undeniable. For instance, pets provide companionship, which can help alleviate feelings of loneliness and depression. They also encourage physical activity, such as walking or playing with the pet, which can help maintain mobility and flexibility.Moreover, pets can have a positive impact on mental health by reducing stress and anxiety. The emotional support and affection provided by pets can be particularly beneficial for older adults who live alone or have limited social interaction. Furthermore, pets can also help older adults establish a daily routine, which can provide a sense of purpose and structure.In spite of the above advantages, the interaction between pets and vulnerable old people still exists. One of the major concerns is the impact of these animals on their tracheas, especially those with asthma. Virtually invisible in the air, many asthma symptoms are caused unconsciously by pets. The dander and hair from pets can trigger allergic reactions and exacerbate respiratory problems, making it difficult for older adults to breathe. Therefore, it is essential for older adults to consider their health and well-being before deciding to have a pet. Nevertheless, with proper care and precautions, the benefits of having a pet can far outweigh the potential problems, and many older adults can enjoy a happier, healthier life with their furry companions.
1300;Some people believe that homework should not be given to school children. Others, however, say that homework is an important requirement for children to be able to develop appropriately. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The benefits of giving or not giving homework to children are often debated. Some people feel that children have enough work to do during one day whilst at school, whereas others feel that the more work set, the better.It is true that schools today place more and more demands and pressure on children. The competition to do well, to enter a good university and to get a good job is significant. This has led to the ideology that children should do as much schoolwork as possible in order to help their intellectual development. The argument, however, that more is better is not always valid. There comes a point, especially for a child, when more knowledge cannot be absorbed in a day. When a child has possibly 7 or 8 classes a day on different subjects, he or she is processing a lot of information already. To give more work to be done at home, therefore, would be pointless and even counterproductive. In addition to this, although it is important to be educated, childhood should also be a time when there is an opportunity to just play and enjoy unstructured time. Homework can significantly lessen the possibilities of doing this.On the other hand, it can be argued that there is a place for homework. If study at school is not overdone, the opportunity to look at work again and extend ideas can be an invaluable exercise. It’s easy to forget one thing that has been taught once, but if that concept is revisited a second time, the brain has time to reprocess and likely better understand and remember.It seems to me that there is a place for homework for today’s children. What must be remembered, though, is that homework needs to be limited to age-appropriate parameters, so that a balance can be struck between study and free time and relaxation.;The debate on whether homework should be given to school children has been ongoing for years. Some people believe that homework is unnecessary and that children have enough work to do during the school day. They argue that the school day is already packed with activities and lessons, and that additional homework would only add to the stress and fatigue of young minds. On the other hand, there are those who believe that homework is an essential requirement for children to develop properly. They think that the more work set, the better, as it helps to reinforce learning, improve understanding, and develop important skills such as time management and self-discipline.However, I believe that there is a middle ground to be found. While homework can be beneficial, it is also important to recognize that there comes a point, especially for a child, when more knowledge cannot be absorbed in a day. Children's minds are like sponges, and they can only absorb so much information before they become overwhelmed. Therefore, homework needs to be limited to age-appropriate parameters, taking into account the child's ability to comprehend and process the information.Moreover, excessive homework can lead to a negative attitude towards learning, and may even affect a child's physical and mental health. It is essential to strike a balance between school work and homework, allowing children to have time for relaxation, play, and other activities that are essential for their overall development. In conclusion, while homework can be a useful tool for learning, it should be assigned judiciously, taking into account the age and ability of the child, and should not be used as a means of overloading them with work. By doing so, we can ensure that children develop a positive attitude towards learning, and are able to reach their full potential.
1369;Some people believe that preserving natural environment is crucial, but make no effort to do so (reasons and solutions);Some people believe that preserving natural environment is crucial, however, most make no effort to do so. Why do you think this is happening? What are some simple actions that could help the environment?It is commonly believed that preservation of natural resources is imperative, yet most people seem to exert no effort in doing so. Understanding the causes of this negligent attitude may help with devising some simple measures to safeguard the deteriorating environment.Lack of awareness is probably the foremost reason why the vast majority of individuals appears to be unmindful of the current environmental issues. Normally, people have tendency to downplay abstract problems, or those to happen in the distant future. This is because they are not properly informed of the possible detrimental effects of taking the environment for granted. To illustrate, residents in urban areas often deliberately dump their into the nearby creeks and drainage canals causing them to become clogged. It is only when devastating floods strike, that they come to realize the consequences of their actions.Some basic solutions that could be carried out are extensive awareness through all forms of communication and strict implementation of waste management. In addition to the traditional press, social media is a powerful means of disseminating information regarding the impending disasters and their potential hazards. This is a good way of persuading the public to actively take part in the campaign. Another straightforward solution, and by far the least anyone can do to help save the nature is disposing of garbage thoughtfully. Apart from avoiding throwing trash anywhere, everyone should practice proper segregation of biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and recyclable wastes at all times. These actions, when coordinated by the local governments, can be tremendously successful.In conclusion, while individual awareness is key to maintaining a healthy ecosystem, concerted efforts of governments and are much more effective in achieving such goal.The response is well written, it contains reasons, solutions and fully addresses the task. The ideas aren’t repeated, they are conveyed in a clear and easy to understand manner and organised well with sufficient use of cohesive devices. The vocabulary is varied, sentence structures are complex and instances of incorrect grammar are hardly noticeable. Overall, this essay is likely to achieve Band 8 in IELTS.;The preservation of the natural environment is a topic of great importance, with many people acknowledging its significance. However, despite this recognition, most individuals fail to take action to protect the environment. This disparity between awareness and action is a puzzling phenomenon that warrants exploration. In my opinion, the primary reason for this inconsistency is the lack of awareness about the severity of environmental issues and the simple actions that can be taken to mitigate them.Lack of awareness is probably the foremost reason why the vast majority of individuals appears to be unmindful of the current environmental issues. Many people are not fully informed about the consequences of their daily actions on the environment, such as the use of plastic, water consumption, and energy usage. As a result, they do not feel the need to make changes to their lifestyle. Furthermore, the complexity of environmental problems can make them seem overwhelming, leading to a sense of powerlessness among individuals.Fortunately, there are numerous simple actions that can contribute significantly to environmental preservation. For instance, reducing plastic usage by carrying reusable bags and water bottles, turning off lights and electronics when not in use, and conserving water can make a significant difference. Additionally, recycling, using public transport, or carpooling can also help reduce carbon emissions. These actions, although small, can collectively have a substantial impact when adopted by a large number of people. Therefore, it is essential to raise awareness and promote education on environmental issues and the simple yet effective actions that can be taken to address them. By bridging the gap between awareness and action, we can work towards a more sustainable future.
1322;Some people believe that the best way to solve environmental problems is to increase the price of fuel.Do you agree or disagree?;"Raising the price of car fuel is believed by some people to be an excellent method to solve the growing number of environmental issues. However, I strongly disagree with this idea, as doing so would make life difficult for lower-income households. While making fuel more expensive wouldn’t change the habits of wealthy families, switching to fossil fuel alternatives could prove to be much more beneficial for the environment.The most compelling reason against raising the cost of fuel is that the upper classes of society will hardly be affected by rising fuel costs, as this only makes up a minor proportion of their expenditure. They will continue to use their personal vehicles as they wish without a thought for the environment or the higher fuel prices, even if their country has state-of-the-art public transportation.Those who will feel the crunch of this decision are the middle-class and lower-income households, since travelling is a major part of most people’s routine, be it to work, school or shopping. Driving is almost unavoidable in many instances; therefore, raising the price of petrol would only serve to widen the gap between the rich and poor, and serve as an inadvertent form of discrimination.Another reason why increasing the cost of fuel is far from the best way to deal with environmental pollution is that now there are much more viable alternatives. Due to the rapid advances in technology, scientists and engineers have been able to develop several alternatives to fossil fuel, such as cars powered by electricity or naturally produced biofuel. The move to adopt clean energy sources instead of fossil fuels is a much more promising alternative compared to simply making fuel more expensive.In conclusion, I believe that governments of the world should invest more time and money in finding alternatives to fossil fuels that are more environmentally friendly, rather than simply raising the cost of petrol.";The issue of environmental problems has sparked a heated debate on the most effective solution. Some people believe that increasing the price of fuel is the best approach to tackle these issues. However, raising the price of petrol is believed by some to be an excellent method to solve the growing number of environmental issues. On the contrary, I strongly disagree with this idea. In my opinion, increasing the price of fuel would have a disproportionate impact on lower-income households, who rely heavily on fuel for their daily commute and other essential activities. This would lead to a significant increase in their cost of living, making life even more difficult for them. Instead of alleviating environmental problems, this approach would exacerbate social and economic inequalities.I believe that governments around the world should invest more time and money in finding alternatives to fossil fuels that are more environmentally friendly. This could include renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydro power. By promoting and subsidizing these alternatives, governments can encourage individuals and businesses to switch to cleaner energy sources, thereby reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating environmental problems. Furthermore, investing in alternative energy sources can also create new job opportunities and stimulate economic growth, making it a more sustainable and equitable solution. In conclusion, while increasing the price of fuel may reduce consumption in the short term, it is not a viable long-term solution to environmental problems. Instead, governments should focus on developing and promoting environmentally friendly alternatives to fossil fuels.
1273;Some people believe that we cannot learn anything from the past for our life today, while others believe that history is a valuable source of information to understand human's life.Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is true that these days people say there is little we can gain from previous history, whereas others think that history is a key source to understand our lives. Although there are some strong arguments against learning history, I agree with learning history to know life of human.There are two reasons why people think there is nothing to gain from history. Firstly, there is evidence to support the idea that learning history stresses people out. Based on a survey conducted by Standford University, 57 percent of people consider learning past life of humans a primary source of stress, while less than 6 percent of people said studying previous humans' life was not a stressor. Secondly, people may not have time to remember historical events because the constant stimulation and hustle and bustle of society is holding them back from their life. In turn, they are more likely to regard learning history as useless.Despite the negative drawbacks, I support that historical event is great information to comprehend human's life. The main benefit of a historical event is that it can have a positive impact on people, especially children, as they grow up. Since history has more connection and support to our lives, it allows children to become more insightful and knowledgeable and discover advanced perspectives. For example, I have been widening my perspective through historical events in my family or country because gaining history regarding my family and nation taught me the right attitude to understand today. However, if I did not know any history, I would not have had an opportunity to understand human life and self-development. So, learning history should be encouraged.In conclusion, while I recognize the possible disadvantages of learning history, I believe that the benefits of gaining past events far outweigh them in the long term.;The debate about the relevance of history in understanding our lives today has sparked intense discussion among scholars and individuals alike. On one hand, people say there is little we can gain from previous history, arguing that it is outdated and has no bearing on our modern lives. They believe that the world is constantly changing, and what happened in the past has minimal impact on our present and future. On the other hand,, others think that history is a key source to understand our lives, providing valuable lessons and insights that can shape our decisions and actions.Despite the negative drawbacks, I firmly support the view that historical events are a great source of information to comprehend human life. Studying history allows children to become more insightful and knowledgeable, and discover advanced perspectives on the world. By learning from past experiences, we can avoid repeating the same mistakes and instead, build upon the successes of our predecessors. For instance, the consequences of World War II have taught us the importance of diplomacy and international cooperation, while the Civil Rights Movement has shown us the power of perseverance and determination in achieving social justice.Furthermore, history provides a unique window into the complexities of human nature, revealing the motivations, values, and beliefs that have shaped human societies over time. By examining historical events, we can gain a deeper understanding of the intricacies of human behavior, politics, and culture, ultimately enabling us to make more informed decisions about our own lives and the world around us. In conclusion, I firmly believe that history is an indispensable tool for understanding human life, and its study should be encouraged and valued.
1342;Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military, while others disagree (opinion);Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military. Others think that women are less suitable for this kind of job. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Sample EssayIn recent years gender equality in employment has been the topic of heated debate. While some may argue that women are less suited for certain jobs such as with the police or the military, I believe that female candidates should be treated the same as their male counterparts.Those who consider women to be unsuited for some kinds of jobs including the police or the military often hold that opinion because such jobs are extremely physically demanding. As the female body has smaller muscles and less physical strength compared to male body, women may have difficulty engaging in strenuous activity which can be exhausting even for men. In military service, female soldiers are more likely to struggle while defending themselves than their male peers when they are forced to move around carrying heavy firearms in the battle, which can increase their risk of mission failure. Because of the hazards and extreme conditions they may encounter, some people advocate that women are not suitable for work in these fields.Nevertheless, I believe that female applicants should be considered for police or military placements without a gender bias, because women are more suited to certain tasks. In the police service, female officers can perform important roles on some occasions such as a body search where male officers are restricted from touching female convicts. In the military service, female nursing staff are more likely to care better for injured soldiers since maternal instinct makes them dedicated and heart-warming professionals. Furthermore, for the sake of fairness to all, job seekers should have an equal opportunity to choose their jobs freely, regardless of gender. Many women have the desire to work in the police and the military and some of them have relevant expertise and qualifications. Therefore, they should not be discriminated against in employment opportunities for these jobs.In conclusion, although some say that women are incompatible with police and military duties because of the high physical demands, I believe that they should be treated as equal to men. This is because there are certain roles with the police and the military that are more suitable for women than men, and therefore both genders should have equal employment opportunities.;The debate over whether women should be treated as equal to men when applying for jobs in the police or military has been a longstanding one. On one hand, some people believe that women should have equal opportunities and be treated the same as men when applying for these positions. They argue that women possess the same capabilities, skills, and strengths as men, and should therefore be given the same consideration. This perspective emphasizes the importance of gender equality and challenges traditional stereotypes that have historically excluded women from these roles.On the other hand, others think that women are less suitable for jobs in the police or military. They argue that these occupations require a certain level of physical strength, which they believe women may not possess. Additionally, they may think that women are more emotionally sensitive and therefore less capable of handling the stresses and dangers associated with these jobs. However, this perspective is often based on outdated and sexist assumptions about women's abilities and is not supported by evidence.In my opinion, women should be treated as equal to men when applying for jobs in the police or military. Women have proven themselves to be highly capable and effective in these roles, and there is no reason to believe that they are inherently less suited to these positions. By treating women equally, we can tap into a wider pool of talent and skills, and create a more diverse and effective police force and military. Ultimately, equality and fairness should be the guiding principles in the application process, and women should be given the same opportunities as men to serve and protect their countries.
1376;Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research (discuss);Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research for the benefit of human beings, while others argue that it is wrong. Discuss both views and give your opinion.People have different views on how medical research should be conducted and tested. Although many people support the use of for developing medicines, I personally believe that animal testing is morally wrong.The main reason why some people value to conduct medical research is because animal testing has contributed to many life-saving cures and treatments. It is true that nearly every medical breakthrough in the last 100 years has resulted directly from research using animals. For example, experiments in which dogs had their pancreases removed led directly to the discovery of insulin, critical to saving the lives of diabetics. Furthermore, it is impossible to release to the market before proving it no harm to humans and laboratory mice are appropriate research subjects because they are similar to human beings in many ways.However, I people who consider medical development that involved the use of animals cruel and unacceptable. I believe that the lives of all creatures should be respected and we, humans, have no right to for our own benefits. Governments should invest in developing alternative methods that can replace when doing medical research. For example, a software program can be developed to model a human immune system and new drugs can be tested on the software rather than animals. In this way, no animals will suffer from the medical tests and the society can still benefit from medical development.In conclusion, although it is undoubtedly true that animal testing has helped scientists in drug developments and medical discoveries, I believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused to animals and we should use alternative methods when doing medical research that do not involve animals suffering.This is a great essay. It addresses the two sides of the argument by exploring reasons why animals should and should not be used in medical research. The ideas are well explained and supported by examples. The use of paragraphing is efficient and helps with logical sequencing of ideas. Linking words are used appropriately to achieve the necessary cohesion. Author’s meaning is skillfully conveyed by the use of wide range of vocabulary. Even though there are some inaccurately used expressions, they don’t hinder understanding. Most sentences are error-free, instances of faulty grammar are rare. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;The use of animals in medical research has been a contentious issue for years, with some people claiming that it is acceptable for the benefit of human beings. Proponents of animal testing argue that it is essential to advance medical knowledge and develop new treatments for life-threatening diseases. They believe that the benefits of animal testing, including the development of vaccines, antibiotics, and cancer treatments, outweigh the harm caused to the animals. According to them, animal testing is a necessary evil that has saved countless human lives and improved the quality of life for many.On the other hand, opponents of animal testing, including myself, believe that it is morally wrong to subject animals to pain, suffering, and death in the name of medical progress. We argue that alternative methods, such as computer simulations, cell cultures, and human clinical trials, can replace animal testing. Moreover, animals are not always a reliable model for human diseases, and the results of animal tests may not be applicable to humans. Furthermore, animal testing is often inhumane and can cause immense suffering to the animals involved.In my opinion, while I understand the potential benefits of animal testing, I believe that the harm caused to animals outweighs the benefits. I think that scientists should explore alternative methods that do not involve animal suffering. With the advancement of technology, it is now possible to conduct medical research without the need for animal testing. Therefore, I believe that it is our moral obligation to prioritize animal welfare and explore alternative methods that promote human well-being without causing harm to animals. Ultimately, I think that it is time to rethink our approach to medical research and strive for a more compassionate and humane approach.
1057;Some people feel that entertainers such as film stars, pop musicians or sports stars are paid too much money.Do you agree or disagree?Which other types of job should be highly paid?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Jobs such as actors, musicians or athlete earns a lot of money, however, a part of people argued that these kinds of people are overpaid. In my opinion, I disagree with this view and believes that they deserved the high salary.People who works as a movie stars, musicians and sports player deserved high money paid. This is because they advocated all there time and effort to get the salary that they have today. Before they become famous, they only have few incomes or even get nothing. That is to say, many musicians did not get any payment at the begining of their career, so do the actors and sports players, they spent their time but do not get any money. For instance, before being a well-known musicians, they have to spend their own money on buying equipment to produce musics or to public the songs they have made. Also, the creativety and their works cannot be measured by money. Thus, they deserved high salary because of their profession and uncopyable works.Jobs which needs professional skills and the job envolves high risk shoul also be highly paid. Such as doctors and programmers, their job are unplaceable because these envolved professional knowledge that not everyone had. Moreover, people works in high-risk environment deserved high payment too. For example, fire-fighters, they might got hurt or even die while working. Therefore, higher salary is needed for jobs that need special skills and career with high risk.To sum up, I agree with the statement because of the reasons above, and jobs with special knowledge and people works in dangerous environment should also be highly paid.;The debate about the compensation of entertainers, such as film stars, pop musicians, and sports stars, has sparked intense discussion. While some people believe that these individuals are overpaid, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, the high salaries earned by actors, musicians, and athletes are well-deserved. The reason behind this is that they have devoted their time and effort to hone their craft, often making tremendous sacrifices to reach the pinnacle of their careers. For instance, a professional athlete may have to dedicate years to rigorous training, risking injuries and maintaining a strict regimen to stay at the top of their game.Moreover, the creativity and value that entertainers bring to society cannot be measured solely by monetary terms. The joy, inspiration, and escapism they provide to millions of people around the world are invaluable. Their work has a profound impact on culture, influencing trends, and bringing people together. It's also worth noting that the money they earn is often a result of the revenue they generate through ticket sales, merchandise, and advertising, which creates a ripple effect in the economy, supporting numerous jobs and industries.In addition to entertainers, jobs that require professional skills and involve high risk should also be highly compensated. For example, doctors, firefighters, and astronauts put their lives on the line every day, making crucial decisions that can mean the difference between life and death. Their expertise, bravery, and commitment to serving others warrant high salaries, as they undertake tasks that the average person cannot or would not dare to do. Therefore, while some may view the salaries of entertainers as excessive, I believe they, along with other high-risk and high-skill professions, deserve the financial rewards they receive for their tireless efforts and the significant contributions they make to society.
1289;Some people feel that fashion is like art and a significant part of society, while others feel that fashion is a waste of time and money.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"The fashion industry today is an important component of society and people’s lives. It is true that many people care little for clothes and scorn the importance that others attach to them; however, this does not mean that the significance that people give to fashion is a waste of time and money.When one considers that areas of the world suffer from poverty, disease and inadequate access to food and clean water, the emphasis attached to fashion by the developed world can seem out of proportion. Many people would contend that the resources put into developing and creating fashion would be more ethically spent on creating some level of equality in terms of the right to live a healthy and happy life. This point is hard to argue with. However, it is also true that people in the developed world cannot be expected to send all their spending money to people in need and that wanting to look good is an unalterable human trait.The fashion industry contributes to the society much like most other industries. It provides jobs and income to millions of people around the world and the money that changes hands generates taxes that contribute to the fabric of society. There is more to fashion than trying to look better than others and excessive luxury. The high level of fashion is indeed a kind of art form and, like other art forms, there will always be people who appreciate it, want to create it and want to spend money on it. It is part of the development of civilisation and this is not likely to change.I therefore feel that, although the gap between the rich and the poor sometimes makes it seem that fashion is a waste of time and money and an unethical use of resources, fashion is an important part of today’s society and economic output. This leads me to believe that trying to strike a balance between selfish greed and a more altruistic way of living should be an individual choice.";The fashion industry has long been a topic of debate, with some people viewing it as a vital part of society and a form of art, while others see it as a frivolous waste of time and money. On one hand, many argue that the resources devoted to creating and developing fashion could be better spent on more pressing issues, such as creating equality and alleviating poverty. From this perspective, the vast amounts of money and labor invested in the fashion industry seem excessive and misguided, especially when compared to the resources allocated to addressing pressing social and economic issues.However, it is also true that the desire to look good is an unalterable human trait. People have always sought to express themselves and showcase their individuality through their clothing and appearance. The fashion industry today is an important component of society and people's lives, providing a means of self-expression, creativity, and cultural exchange. Fashion has the power to evoke emotions, spark conversations, and bring people together. Moreover, the industry provides employment opportunities and contributes significantly to the economy of many countries. For instance, the fashion industry is a substantial contributor to the GDP of countries like Italy and France, and provides livelihoods for millions of people around the world.In my opinion, fashion is not a waste of time and money, but rather a significant aspect of human culture and society. While it is true that some of the resources devoted to fashion could be redirected towards more pressing issues, it is also important to recognize the value that fashion brings to people's lives and to the economy. By embracing fashion as a form of artistic expression and a means of self-expression, we can appreciate its significance and importance in our lives, while also acknowledging the need for balance and responsibility in the way resources are allocated. Ultimately, fashion is a reflection of human creativity, diversity, and individuality, and its importance should not be underestimated.
1294;Some people feel that learning a foreign language is an essential component of a child’s education. Others feel that learning a foreign language is often a waste of time that can be better spent on learning about technology and other more vocational subjects.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Throughout the history of education, learning a foreign language or languages has been a constant component. Of course, many people feel that this is really an unnecessary part of education for everyone, but this is not a point of view that I share.The opponents to learning a foreign language might argue that most people do not travel that often outside their own country. In addition to this, out of all the countries of the world, comparatively not many share the same language. Therefore, learning a foreign language will only be useful for the very limited time that one spends in a country where this language is used. For some people, the language might never be used in their entire lives. When one thinks about how much time and money are spent training language teachers, buying resources, going on trips and delivering lessons for such a negligible benefit, this would seem to be a very inefficient allocation of resources.However, the benefits of learning a foreign language go further than just the ability to use it from time to time on a holiday or business trip. Firstly, through learning one language, one gains an understanding to some extent of how all languages work. Thus, no matter where people might end up around the world, the knowledge of language can be of use. Secondly, with the study of a foreign language, one also opens oneself up to other cultures. This allows in turn an appreciation for different points of view and belief systems. With an ever-shrinking world due to globalisation, the ability to empathise and understand the people from other countries is vital to reducing conflict and creating a more tolerant society. Finally, quite simply learning languages is excellent for the improvement of general cognitive skills.It seems to me that learning a foreign language, therefore, is more than just gaining the ability to speak a few words of a foreign tongue. It is part of intellectual and social development and needs to be continued for everyone in today’s schools.;The debate about whether learning a foreign language is an essential component of a child's education has sparked intense discussion among educators and parents. On one hand, many people feel that learning a foreign language is really an unnecessary part of education for everyone. They argue that the time and resources spent on language learning could be better utilized on more vocational subjects like technology. However, the benefits of learning a foreign language go further than just the ability to use it from time to time on a holiday or business trip.Through learning one language, one gains an understanding to some extent of how all languages work. This linguistic awareness enables individuals to pick up new languages more easily and appreciate the complexities of language structures. Moreover, learning a foreign language opens oneself up to other cultures, allowing in turn an appreciation for different points of view and belief systems. This cross-cultural understanding is invaluable in today's globalized world, where communication and collaboration across borders are increasingly important.In my opinion, learning a foreign language is a crucial aspect of a child's education. Not only does it enhance career opportunities in a global job market, but it also fosters empathy, tolerance, and open-mindedness. For instance, a student who learns Spanish is not only able to communicate with native Spanish speakers but also gains insight into the rich cultural heritage of Spain and Latin America. By learning a foreign language, individuals can broaden their perspectives, challenge their assumptions, and develop a more nuanced understanding of the world. Therefore, I firmly believe that learning a foreign language is an indispensable part of a child's education, and its benefits extend far beyond the classroom.
1073;Some people feel that the design of newly constructed buildings in big cities should be controlled by governments. Others believe those who finance the construction of a building should be free to design it as they see fit.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is often argued that governments should involve in construction's design in huge cities, while others argued that governments do not have to retrict the free of designers' imagination if those designs are splendid fit on the cities. I believe that if that were to happen, it would be the positive development. This essay will highlight the both views and give personal opinion from the former argument's side.To begin with latter opinion, although governments have worried about the combination of buildings entirely, the strong limitation about design can cause squandering of designers' skills. There are huge number of competitions about designing building in this society, and the evolution in these fields has developed dramatically. However, if there is a strict criteria on design of building, the majority of intelligences do not need to hammer away to come up with revolutional outline for building.On the other hand, signitured design of the big cities by itself can be the purpose of trevelling as a landmark, and it can be followed by significant economical achievement in the country. To take myself as an example, in 2017, I went to Gold Coast for study automotive engineering, and I was stunnied becaused of the atmosphere which is formed by combination of similar buildings and beach. Furthermore, according to the research from Sydney university, Gold Coast is one of the cities which make a fortune because of marvelous view.To sum up with, I would therefore argue that in spite of the fact that building design restriction can influence on architects negatively, it has a potential ability to make a significant profit in the future.;The design of newly constructed buildings in big cities has been a topic of debate, with some advocating for government control and others pushing for the freedom to design as they see fit. On one hand, those who finance the construction of a building argue that they should have the autonomy to design it according to their preferences and business needs. This perspective emphasizes the importance of individual creativity and innovation in architecture, which can lead to unique and iconic structures that reflect the character of the building's owners.On the other hand, I firmly believe that the design of newly constructed buildings should be controlled by governments. This is because unregulated construction can lead to a lack of cohesion and harmony in the urban landscape, resulting in a disjointed and unattractive cityscape. Furthermore, government control can ensure that buildings are designed with consideration for the environment, public spaces, and the overall aesthetic of the city. For instance, cities like Paris and Rome are famous for their beautifully designed buildings and streets, which are a major draw for tourists. The signature design of these cities is, in itself, a purpose for traveling, making them landmarks that attract visitors from around the world. If left uncontrolled, the construction of new buildings could disrupt the historic and cultural charm of these cities, diminishing their appeal to tourists and residents alike.In conclusion, while the argument for freedom to design has its merits, I believe that government control over the design of newly constructed buildings is essential for maintaining the unique character and charm of big cities. By regulating design, governments can ensure that new constructions blend in with the existing architecture, preserving the city's identity and making it a desirable destination for travelers and a pleasant place to live for residents.
1292;Some people feel that with the rise of artificial intelligence, computers and robots will take over the roles of teachers. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;With ever increasing technological advances, computers and robots are replacing human roles in different areas of society. This trend can also be seen in education, where interactive programs can enhance the educational experience for children and young adults. Whether, however, this revolution can also take over the role of the teacher completely is debatable, and I oppose this idea as it is unlikely to serve students well.The roles of computers and robots can be seen in many areas of the workplace. Classic examples are car factories, where a lot of the repetitive precision jobs done on assembly lines have been performed by robots for many years, and medicine, where diagnosis, and treatment, including operations, have also been assisted by computers for a long time. According to the media, it won’t also be long until we have cars that are driven automatically.It has long been discussed whether robots and computers can do this in education. It is well known that the complexity of programs can now adapt to so many situations that something can already be set up that has the required knowledge of the teacher, along with the ability to predict and answer all questions that might be asked by students. In fact, due to the nature of computers, the knowledge levels can far exceed a teacher’s and have more breadth, as a computer can have equal knowledge in all the subjects that are taught in school, as opposed to a single teacher’s specialisation. It seems very likely, therefore, that computers and robots should be able to deliver the lessons that teachers can, including various ways of differentiating and presenting materials to suit varying abilities and ages of students.Where I am not convinced is in the pastoral role of teachers. Part of teaching is managing behaviour and showing empathy with students, so that they feel cared for and important. Even if a robot or computer can be programmed to imitate these actions, students will likely respond in a different way when they know an interaction is part of an algorithm rather than based on human emotion.Therefore, although I feel that computers should be able to perform a lot of the roles of teachers in the future, they should be used as educational tools to assist teachers and not to replace them. In this way, students would receive the benefits of both ways of instruction.;The rise of artificial intelligence has led to the replacement of human roles in various areas of society, with computers and robots taking over tasks that were previously performed by humans. This trend can also be seen in education, where interactive programs and virtual learning tools are being used to enhance the educational experience for children and young adults. While these technological advancements have the potential to revolutionize the way we learn, some people believe that they will eventually replace the role of teachers altogether. However, I disagree with this notion.On one hand, it is undeniable that technology has the ability to make learning more engaging and accessible. Interactive programs can provide personalized learning experiences, offer real-time feedback, and make complex concepts more understandable. For instance, online platforms like Khan Academy and Coursera have made high-quality educational content available to people all over the world. Moreover, virtual teaching assistants can help with tasks such as grading and data analysis, freeing up time for teachers to focus on more critical aspects of education.On the other hand, I firmly believe that the role of a teacher extends far beyond the mere transmission of knowledge. Teachers provide emotional support, guidance, and mentorship, which are essential for the holistic development of students. They also help students develop critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills, which are difficult to replicate with technology alone. Furthermore, teachers play a vital role in shaping the social and emotional skills of students, such as empathy, communication, and teamwork, which are crucial for their future success.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the potential of technology to enhance education, I do not think that computers and robots will completely take over the role of teachers. The nuances of human interaction, empathy, and guidance that a teacher provides are irreplaceable, and it is essential to strike a balance between technology and human instruction to create an optimal learning environment.
1285;Some people like to own the place where they live, but other people like to rent where they live. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The debate over whether it is better to own or rent the property in which one lives is one that has strong supporters on each side. There are persuasive arguments for both points of view.One of the main advantages of renting a property is flexibility. Usually, a tenant only has to give a month’s notice before changing where he or she lives. If a property is owned and a change is needed, the property must be put onto the market and it is frequently a long and stressful process to get a sale completed. Sometimes, the wrong time of year or a bad market can mean that a sale is not possible. Another advantage of renting is that a large amount of a family’s capital is not tied up in the property. Property can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and often a lot more. If one rents, this money can be spent on other things to help improve the family’s quality of life. If the property is on a mortgage, then the deposit, also often very large, is tied up in the property and the pressure of having to make substantial payments every month can cause a lot of stress.Owning a property does have various advantages, though. Even though people usually have to service a mortgage every month with payments, this money is then built up with the property. With renting, the money is lost to the landlord, but at the end of the term of the mortgage, the whole property is owned by the family. This makes the process of living in a property a type of investment. In addition, the property’s value often goes up after time, frequently creating a substantial profit. Owning the property where one lives can also create a sense of well-being and self-actualisation.The decision to whether one rents or owns the property in which one lives really boils down to individual preference. My opinion is that it is much more preferable to own a property, mainly because it creates a valuable asset for the family.;The debate over whether it is better to own or rent the property in which one lives is one that has strong supporters on each side. On the one hand, there are those who advocate for renting, citing the numerous benefits it provides. One of the main advantages of renting a property is flexibility. Renters are not tied to a specific location for an extended period, allowing them to move freely to different parts of the country or even abroad if their job or personal circumstances require it. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for young professionals or individuals with uncertain career paths.Another advantage of renting is that a large amount of a family's capital is not tied up in the property. This means that families can invest their money in other assets, such as stocks, bonds, or education, which can potentially yield higher returns. Moreover, renters are not responsible for maintenance and repair costs, which can be a significant financial burden. However, in my opinion, these advantages do not outweigh the benefits of owning a property. My opinion is that it is much more preferable to own the property because it creates a valuable asset for the family. Over time, the value of the property is likely to appreciate, providing a significant source of wealth. Additionally, owning a property gives individuals and families a sense of stability and permanence, allowing them to put down roots and become a part of their community. While there are valid arguments on both sides, I firmly believe that the long-term benefits of owning a property make it the more desirable option.
1405;Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding changes. Others, however think that change is always a good thing. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;Nowadays, people are arguing whether an ideal lifestyle should be a stable one or should it include a wide ranges of changes.In my opinion, whether changes are needed should be determined the of you are at.Apparently, are favorable the development of young people, in to their careers. Primarily, an abundant experience in varieties of jobs enables the young to master a broad range of techniques and skills, leading to significant edge over counterparts in the competition for employment. Meanwhile, trying various roles in life and work provides wide of lifestyles for the young in the future. Only after this comparison can they realize what the real goals of their .However, other than frequent changes, the elderly who have undergone all these challenges may pursue a steady lifestyle. For the elders, concentration on their favorite activities would give rise to a sense of enjoyment and security, which is helpful to physical and psychological health. Due to a stable life, the elderly are less exposed to stress, leading to a decrease in adrenal hormones and resulting in their well-.Furthermore, degeneration of mental and physical function would make the elderly unlikely to adapt to external changes, causing and , which are not contributing to their health.Above all, it is unlikely to describe the changes in life with a positive or negative term. Accommodation for personal needs and goals is more important than the changes themselves.;The concept of an ideal lifestyle has sparked a heated debate among people, with some advocating for a stable and routine-oriented life, while others believe that change is always a good thing. On one hand, a stable lifestyle can provide a sense of security and comfort, allowing individuals to establish a consistent daily routine and build strong relationships. This approach can be particularly beneficial for the elderly, who have undergone various challenges in their lives and may now prefer a steady and predictable lifestyle.On the other hand, changes can be highly beneficial, especially for young people who are just starting their careers. Exposing themselves to a wide range of experiences and challenges can foster personal growth, creativity, and innovation. Frequent changes can help young individuals develop adaptability, resilience, and a broader perspective, which are essential skills in today's fast-paced and ever-evolving world. In my opinion, whether changes are needed should be determined by the stage of life one is at. For young people, changes can be a catalyst for development and progress, while for the elderly, a stable lifestyle can be a well-deserved rest after a lifetime of hard work and challenges.Ultimately, a balance between stability and change is crucial for a fulfilling life. While some people may thrive in a stable environment, others may need changes to stay motivated and engaged. By acknowledging the different needs and preferences at various stages of life, we can create a more inclusive and supportive society that values both consistency and innovation. In conclusion, whether an ideal lifestyle should be stable or include a wide range of changes depends on individual circumstances and stages of life, and striking a balance between the two is essential for a happy and fulfilling life.
1423;Some people say education is the only critical factor to the development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;One the one hand good education is a highly recommended skill in the developed countries, on the other hand of many people in regions of poverty. But what makes education key factor for the development of a countryWe must acknowledge that education is something that we all need. The differences are just what we learn. Mostly the limited educational horizons of poor and less educated people have more to deal with their personal situation than with problems of bigger effects on a country. Attending school is sometimes too expensive and it does not feed a family.Nevertheless there must be a reason for education. For me it looks like some countries have realized that Education is the key for the globalization process. If we take India for example we can see that a change in the educational system had changed the economy of the country. country has changed from a poor region to a high potential for IT knowledge.In regard to this fact of education seriously and offer it to a wide range of people. Spending money education is the key tippy title=”for”]to[/tippy] a new future effects on the economy and social life. All in all I agree with the importance of education for the development of a country. Less knowledge leads to poverty and . Learning and Knowledge is Power and an investment in the near future and therefore it has to be an official task.;The statement that education is the only critical factor to the development of a country is a subject of debate among scholars and policymakers. While I agree that education plays a vital role in the development of a country, I do not entirely concur that it is the only critical factor.Education is a key factor for the development of a country, as it enables individuals to acquire knowledge, skills, and competencies necessary for economic growth, social progress, and political stability. Educated citizens are more likely to contribute to the development of their country by being productive, innovative, and active participants in the labor market. For instance, some countries have realized that education is the key to the globalization process, as it equips their citizens with the skills and knowledge required to compete in the global economy. Countries like South Korea, Singapore, and Finland have made significant investments in education and have reaped the benefits of a highly skilled and educated workforce.However, other factors such as infrastructure development, economic policies, and political stability also play a crucial role in the development of a country. A country with a well-educated population but inadequate infrastructure, poor economic policies, and political instability is unlikely to achieve significant development. Therefore, while education is a critical factor, it is not the only one. A combination of education, good governance, and economic development is necessary for a country to achieve sustainable development. In conclusion, education is a vital component of a country's development, but it is not the sole factor. Other elements must also be considered to ensure a country's overall growth and prosperity.
87;Some people say free time activities for children should be organized by parents. Others say that children should be free to choose what they do in their free time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Whether parents should fully intervene in their children's organization of their leisure time or let them decide it, remains a big discussion. In this essay I will contrast the two opinions and I will explain why I think a good balance is needed.One of the reasons supporting the first view is the idea of the undeveloped children's ability to organize. This is because, although some of them might seem very mature for their age, others might struggle understanding the importance of having a routine, besides playing video games. For instance, many parents orientate their children helping them to organize hobbies and teaching a very important skill, time managment.On the other hand, some people encourage children to decide themselves what to do as this stimulates creativity and personal growth. This view, therefore, opens a new world for the little ones who can decide whatever they like, having multiple options. For example, children in this situation quite often are supported when they want to play sports or participate in a painting class.In my opinion, parents should not only be envolved as much as they can in all aspects of their children's lives, but also they might encourage the little ones to have personal opinions and decision about their hobbies and leisure actitivities. This may be a good way to build trust and communication between parents and children. Moreover, children learn responsability while being guided by their parents.In conclusion, some parents help their children more in scheduling their free time, while others intervene less leaving them to create a routine freely. I believe, parents should always be involved in their children's lives and decisions, allowing children participation too, which brings multiple benefits to their relationship.;The debate surrounding the organization of free time activities for children has sparked a significant amount of discussion. On one hand, some people argue that parents should take an active role in scheduling their children's free time, as it helps them develop important life skills and ensures their safety. On the other hand,, others believe that children should be given the freedom to choose what they do in their free time, allowing them to explore their interests and develop independence.Some parents help their children more in scheduling their free time, enrolling them in various extracurricular activities and sports, while others intervene less, leaving them to create a routine freely. This approach allows children to make their own decisions and take responsibility for their actions. However, the lack of parental guidance can lead to children spending excessive amounts of time on screens or engaging in unhealthy habits.In my opinion, parents should not only be involved as much as they can in all aspects of their children's lives, including their free time. By doing so, parents can provide their children with a sense of structure and security, while also allowing them to make choices and learn from their mistakes. Parents can help their children discover their passions and interests, and provide them with opportunities to develop new skills. Moreover, parental involvement can also help children develop important life skills such as time management, prioritization, and decision-making. Ultimately, striking a balance between parental guidance and children's independence is crucial for raising well-rounded and responsible individuals. By being actively involved in their children's lives, parents can help them make the most of their free time and set them up for success in the future.
1330;Some people say that all popular TV entertainment programmes should aim to educate viewers about important social issues. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It is often said that all influential TV entertainment programs should be geared towards raising people’s awareness about social issues that matter. While some TV programs could be suitable for this purpose, I disagree with the view that it should be mandatory for all of them, as the decision whether to do so must take into account the nature of the TV content and the channel’s audience.There is a large group of professionals who would benefit from deepening their understanding of what is happening in the world. Stock traders and bankers, for example, must always keep track of numerous business trends on a global scale, and they would appreciate this type of information on their favourite TV shows. Young people are another suitable audience due to the fact that they enjoy learning about popular topics from TV programmes. For instance, SDGs or the Sustainable Development Goals has now become an important topic to learn for children at school. Educational TV would provide a welcome alternative to textbooks, making learning more fun.Despite the potential advantages of incorporating educational content in TV programs, it is important to remember that the purpose of entertainment TV is for people to escape reality, to take a break from their hectic lives. Being reminded about some troubling social issues would not be appreciated by those who just want to unwind after a long day at work. Another consideration is how the content is perceived by the audience, because broadcasting serious topics as part of a comedy show might lead some viewers to believe they are of lesser significance. This would make TV shows of light-hearted nature a poor choice for inclusion of content on pressing social issues.In conclusion, entertainment TV programs can be an effective form of education for some people and a great tool to spread information. However, not all of them should be used for this purpose as there are various ways people appreciate them.;The notion that all popular TV entertainment programmes should aim to educate viewers about important social issues has sparked a heated debate. While I agree that entertainment TV programs can be an effective form of education for some people, I disagree that all of them should be used for this purpose.On the one hand, TV entertainment programmes can be a valuable tool for raising awareness about significant social issues, such as discrimination, inequality, and environmental concerns. By incorporating educational content into their storylines, these programmes can reach a vast audience and inspire positive change. Moreover, they can make complex issues more accessible and engaging, especially for those who may not be interested in traditional educational formats. For instance, a popular TV show can tackle a social issue in a way that is both entertaining and thought-provoking, encouraging viewers to think critically about the topic.On the other hand, not all TV entertainment programmes should be used for educational purposes. There are various ways people appreciate these programmes, and some viewers may simply want to relax and be entertained without being educated. Additionally, if all programmes were to focus on educating viewers, it could lead to a lack of diversity in the types of shows available, potentially boring or overwhelming audiences. People have different preferences when it comes to TV shows, and some may prefer to watch programmes that are purely entertaining, without any educational value. Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between educational content and entertainment value, allowing viewers to choose the type of programme that suits their interests and needs.In conclusion, while TV entertainment programmes can be an effective form of education, it is not necessary or desirable for all of them to aim to educate viewers about important social issues. A mix of educational and purely entertaining programmes would be more beneficial, catering to the diverse tastes and needs of audiences. By doing so, TV entertainment programmes can continue to educate and engage viewers, while also providing a platform for relaxation and entertainment.
1353;Some people say that arts subjects are as essential as academic ones and should be part of school syllabus (agree/disagree);"Some people say that art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are an essential part of education, and every school should include them in its syllabus. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your opinion and examples from your own experience.Art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are fundamentals that enrich our lives. However, some parents say schools on teaching more academic subjects, such as mathematics, science, literature and history. In my opinion, both academic and arts subjects should be taught and I will expand on the pros and cons of including arts in the school program further on in this essay.On the one hand, academic subjects are often required when we get into higher . Academic subjects may be considered as in the academic world. Personally, I have never taken an entrance exam of art subjects for high school or university. In other words, schools measured my academic abilities using academic subjects, not art subjects. To suit the current educational system, many parents in my home country, Japan, send their children to cram schools to study academic subjects deeply.On the other hand, art subjects can strengthen the creativity and flexibility of individuals. Liberal arts, which include cultural understanding and knowledge, also include other arts subjects. In addition, we are living in the era of automation and artificial intelligence which are replacing human labor and office work more and more. In this regard, human creativity becomes more important. Therefore, art subjects are being more in demand to make a difference between individuals and computers.In conclusion, academic and arts subjects should blend in a school syllabus in a balanced way. Art subjects can also a better personality in individuals, so participation in these classes should be encouraged as well as academic achievements.The writer explored the reasons why including arts subjects in school syllabus is a good idea, while fluently expressing ideas and supporting them by examples. Correct paragraphing assists with orderly presentation of information, making this essay easy to follow; the range of vocabulary is quite wide. Accuracy of expression needs a bit more attention (see corrections underlined in blue), but overall, this essay could achieve IELTS Band 8.";The debate about the importance of arts subjects in schools has been ongoing, with some people arguing that they are as essential as academic ones and should be part of the school syllabus. Some people say that art subjects such as music, drama, and creative writing are fundamentals that enrich our lives, fostering creativity, imagination, and self-expression. These subjects provide students with a platform to explore their talents, develop their critical thinking skills, and cultivate their emotional intelligence.However, some parents argue that schools should focus on teaching more academic subjects, such as mathematics, science, literature, and history, which they believe are more practical and essential for future careers. They contend that these subjects provide students with a solid foundation in critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills, which are crucial for success in an increasingly competitive world.In my opinion, both academic and arts subjects should be taught in schools. Arts subjects complement academic subjects, providing students with a well-rounded education that encompasses both intellectual and creative development. By incorporating arts subjects into the curriculum, students can develop their imagination, creativity, and innovation, which are essential skills for the 21st century. Moreover, the arts subjects can help students to develop their emotional intelligence, empathy, and social skills, which are vital for building strong relationships and achieving personal and professional success. Therefore, I firmly believe that arts subjects are as essential as academic ones and should be an integral part of the school syllabus, providing students with a holistic education that prepares them for a lifetime of learning, growth, and success.
779;Some people say that modern technology has made shopping today easier, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion;It is commonly argued that the fast pacing technology has helped people do shopping at the present time more easily. However, some people think online shopping is really difficult for them. This essay will consider both the advantages and disadvantages of the use of technology for shopping.One disadvantage of online shopping can be mentioned is that people cannot familiarize themselves with online applications for ordering essential goods and food. In fact, the elderly are not good at technology enough to go to virtual supermarkets. Besides, those who live in remote areas are not accessible easily to technology to buy online groceries.Despite its disadvantage, online shopping has brought about advantages for those who are technology natives. Firstly, it can be time-saving. In fact, shoppers can order any things they need with some clicks on the items, payment method, and time of delivery. Especially in a lingering Covid-19, when social distancing measures have been effective in some places in Viet Nam, according to a survey, the number of online shoppers has been increasing day by day, and thus many applications have been into existence, developed, and thrived.Another advantage of virtual shopping is that it can be life-saving to many people in a pandemic across nations. Going to supermarkets can be detrimental to buyers due to the spread of viruses and the higher risk of infection. For example, in order to buy bread for breakfast, people have to go out for it and thus may be exposed to infectious or incubated victims of Covid-19. Moreover, with preventive measures of Covid-19 containment, such as people not being allowed to go out for their essential goods, if they do not know how to make an online order, it is really difficult for them to survive during a pandemic.In conclusion, the use of technology for virtual shopping is beneficial to our time-saving and life-saving matters, though it is not familiar to some people. In my opinion, thanks to its advantages, I will continue to go shopping online, though the world has gone through the Covid-19 pandemic successfully.;The advent of modern technology has revolutionized the way people shop, with some arguing that it has made shopping easier, while others disagree. On the one hand, some people think that online shopping is really difficult for them, as they may not be familiar with the digital platforms or may have limited access to the internet. This can lead to frustration and a preference for traditional brick-and-mortar stores. Additionally, older generations or those living in rural areas may struggle with online transactions, making shopping more challenging for them.On the other hand, despite its disadvantages, online shopping has brought about numerous advantages for those who are technology natives. For instance, online shopping platforms offer a wide range of products, competitive prices, and convenient delivery options, making it easier for people to shop from the comfort of their own homes. Furthermore, online shopping can be life-saving to many people in a pandemic across nations, as it allows them to purchase essential items without having to physically visit stores, thereby reducing the risk of exposure to the virus.In my opinion, modern technology has indeed made shopping easier for the majority of people. The benefits of online shopping, such as convenience, flexibility, and accessibility, outweigh the drawbacks. Moreover, as technology continues to advance, online shopping platforms are becoming increasingly user-friendly, making it easier for people of all ages and backgrounds to navigate and make purchases. Overall, while there may be some challenges associated with online shopping, the advantages it offers make it an invaluable tool for modern shoppers, and its importance has been further highlighted during the pandemic.

I strongly agree that the internet is making it easier for people to communicate, effectively making the world smaller. The internet is just like a wonder box, which contains every type of information, and has transformed the way we connect with others.In today's modernized era, nobody has sufficient time to write letters to their loved ones, a practice that was common in the past. With the emergence of the internet, and subsequent advancements in technology, communication has become faster and more convenient.

727;Some people say that the experiences a child has before starting school have the most influence on their future life. Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. Discuss both views and give your own opinion?;There are a lot of research about development in human life, Some people say that the experiences a child has before starting school have the most influence on their future life. Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. In the following paragraph, I will discuss both view and give my opinion.On the one hands, There has a research that bad experience in children before begining at school, especcially in family, will become unforgettable deep heart. For example, Children who live with strict parents and has aggressive punishment when children doing littie wrong things. In the future, Children will tend to aggressive and feeling they has not received a love from family. This research surely reasonnable because family is an important factor of social life.On the other hands, There have an opinion even if children was velvet glove when raised with family. However, Especially in adolescent, Friend and teacher can infleuence as same as family because teenagers spend more time at school that with family as a reason learning in classroom more than primary school and have a more group work with friend. Thus, If teenager prefer to close with a good student (not smoking or drinking alcohol / invite classroom friends travel education museum in weekends or holiday), Parents can make sure that your child will mature to standard adults.In conclusion, In my opinion, Children would be infleuenced by family before begining at school. After that, They will has a lot of complex relationship in school from friends and teachers that can infleuences children. So, Children should try to control yourself in moral to be a best quality adults.;The age-old debate about the most pivotal period in a person's life has sparked intense discussion among researchers and scholars. There are a plethora of research studies about development in human life, attempting to pinpoint the exact stage that has the most profound impact on an individual's future. Some people say that the experiences a child has before starting school have the most influence on their future life. They argue that the formative years, typically between birth and age five, lay the foundation for cognitive, social, and emotional development. During this period, children learn to navigate their surroundings, form attachments, and develop essential skills that will serve as the building blocks for future success.Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. They contend that adolescence is a time of significant physical, emotional, and psychological change, where individuals begin to explore their identities, form meaningful relationships, and develop a sense of purpose. School, in particular, plays a critical role in shaping a teenager's worldview, providing opportunities for socialization, and fostering academic and personal growth. In the following paragraph, I will discuss both views and give my opinion. In my opinion, both perspectives have merit, and it is difficult to pinpoint a single stage as the most influential. However, I tend to agree that the experiences before starting school have a profound impact, as they establish the groundwork for future development. Nevertheless, experiences during adolescence, particularly at school, also play a vital role in shaping an individual's future. Ultimately, it is the cumulative effect of experiences across various stages of life that molds a person's future, and it is essential to recognize the significance of both early childhood and adolescent experiences in shaping the trajectory of one's life.
337;Some people think history has nothing or little to tell us, but others think that studying the past history can help us better understand the present. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;With the development of technology, an increasing number of people try to acquire the latest technology such as computer programming, rather than to study history. There is a debate whether studying histroy could give us more advantages to understand the present society. In my opinion, obtaining knowledge of past history would be definitely helpful for us to live well in society today. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.To begin with, looking back on history would give us the opportunity to notice mistakes which human beings used to make in the past. Specifically, all kinds of people and countries around the world had made innumerable mistakes throughout history. Besides, some of these mistakes might result in a huge number of victims. Therefore, human beings must avoid these tragedic events happening again. Above all, only knowing history could lead to avoidance of the recurrences. To be more specific, World War must be one of the serious events in human being history, and understanding of this truth have a significant impact on how we should live not to cause war again in the present society. It is manifest that leaning history is meaningful in this regard.On the other hand, some arguments can be made that old stories have little something to do with our present lives. However, closer examination would reveal that all the relationships present today originally come from something in the past. Knowing history enables us to find the best way to a fruitful future. The compelling example of this is racial discrimination in the U.S. Understanding the U.S. history could give us the best manner not to deteriorate relationships in the U.S. I suppose that studying history would be helpful for all human beings from this aspect.Having considered all the arguments above, learning history would be a major contributor to a better understanding of the present because we can know how to avoid the same mistake people used to made and how we should behave for the better result through history.;The relevance of studying history has sparked a heated debate among scholars and individuals alike. Some argue that history has little to offer in terms of understanding the present, while others firmly believe that examining the past can provide invaluable insights into contemporary society. In my opinion, obtaining knowledge of past history would be definitely helpful for us to live well in society today.I hold this opinion for two reasons. Firstly, studying history allows us to learn from past mistakes and successes, which can inform our decisions and actions in the present. By analyzing historical events, we can identify patterns and trends that have shaped the world we live in today. This understanding can help us avoid repeating past errors and instead, build upon the achievements of previous generations. For instance, the study of historical economic crises can provide valuable lessons on how to navigate and mitigate the effects of similar events in the present.Secondly, history provides a rich context for understanding the complexities of modern society. It helps us comprehend the evolution of social, cultural, and political norms, which in turn enables us to better navigate the intricacies of our contemporary world. By studying history, we gain a deeper appreciation for the diversity and plurality that exist within our societies, fostering empathy, tolerance, and more informed civic engagement. In conclusion, while there may be a debate about the utility of studying history, I firmly believe that it offers significant advantages in understanding the present. By learning from the past, we can build a more informed, empathetic, and progressive society. Therefore, I strongly advocate for the continued study and appreciation of history as a vital component of a well-rounded education.
411;Some people think students should study the science of food and how to prepare it. Others think that school time should be used in learning important subjects. Discuss both views and give your opinion?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;These days a portion of the society consider that students must learn the subject of cooking food and ways to make meals meanwhile, a group of people think that educational institutions shall be used to study more essential courses. I strongly agree that schools should be used for learning far important subjects rather than cooking classes. In this essay a im going to examin and discuss both phenomenon viewpoints and draw my personal opinion.In one hand, some people think that cooking and food subjects should be an important courses in schools,in addition, the steps of preparing meals and information about food may help students for a healthy lifestyle.On the other hand, a group of individuals consider that cooking is a hobby and cooking classes must be optional to the student and not requiered for all students, to illustrate even more, a bigger portion of students may not be interested in cooking as others,whereas, schools must be used for more serious purposes ,for example, studying more complicated courses will have a positive effect on the students academic outcomes ,meanwhile, adding courses such as cooking might effect the students time manegement and influence their ability to focus on the important things,for further explaination, if they have a test or different assignments deadlines they should be really focusing on that rather than attending cooking classes.In conclustion, and after analysis of both penomenon i presonally believe that cooking classes should not be considered as an essential course for students in educational institutions.;"The debate about whether students should study the science of food and how to prepare it has sparked a heated discussion among educators and parents. On one hand, some people think that cooking and food subjects should be important courses in schools. They argue that the steps of preparing meals and information about food may help students adopt a healthy lifestyle. By learning about nutrition and cooking techniques, students can develop essential life skills that will benefit them throughout their lives. For instance, understanding the importance of balanced diets and how to prepare nutritious meals can help students make informed choices about their eating habits, leading to better overall health and wellbeing.On the other hand, a group of individuals consider that cooking is a hobby and cooking classes must be optional to the student and not required for all students. They believe that school time should be focused on more ""important"" subjects such as mathematics, science, and language. According to them, cooking classes may distract students from their core academic studies and may not be relevant to their future careers. However, I disagree with this view. I think that learning about food and cooking is an essential part of a student's education, as it provides them with practical skills and knowledge that can be applied in their daily lives. Moreover, with the rising concerns about obesity and unhealthy eating habits among young people, I believe that teaching students about healthy eating and cooking can have long-term benefits for their health and wellbeing. In conclusion, I think that studying the science of food and how to prepare it should be an integral part of school curricula, as it provides students with valuable life skills and promotes healthy lifestyles."
59;Some people think that governments should ban dangerous sports, while others think people should have freedom to do any sports or activity. Discuss both views and give your own opinion;From the known history of the humanity, many sports or activities have been done to enjoy ourselfs, keeping in shape, or spent time. Grown up people should be free to do any kind of sports or activities by their will unless they are not hurting anyone else except theirselfs.Some people think when a citizen hurt his/herself, tax payers need to pay for the health care fees, and it should not be consern for the tax payers since they are paying only for fundamental situations. This point of view is not matching with the freedom. Yes, there might be a fee for tax payers, yet freedom should be above on all fees. While some people prefers less dangerous activities, others can be interested in more dangerous activities, as well.Governments can have some precautions to make citizens' life better. Yet, they should not involve such things like banning sports since it is the preference of the people which dealing with the dangerous sports. Some people could want to make more unique or exciting sports, and it is quite natural. Banning such kind of activities can be considered as limiting people's freedom.Since most of the people living together for a quite time in a society, people should pay respect on each others preferences, unless it is not interesting other people's personal area. As a calm and relax person, I am not intend to make dangerous sports or activities. However, I do not think that I have the right or power to say other people what should they do or not, and vice versa.;"The debate on whether governments should ban dangerous sports has sparked intense discussion among individuals with differing opinions. On one hand, some people believe that governments should prohibit hazardous sports to ensure public safety and minimize the risk of injuries. They argue that when a citizen engages in a dangerous activity and gets hurt, taxpayers are ultimately responsible for covering the healthcare costs. This perspective emphasizes the potential burden on the public healthcare system and the need for government intervention to prevent such scenarios.On the other hand, others firmly believe that people should have the freedom to choose any sport or activity they wish to participate in, as long as they are not harming anyone else except themselves. This viewpoint prioritizes individual autonomy and the right to make personal choices, even if they involve a degree of risk. It is essential to acknowledge that people have diverse preferences when it comes to sports and activities; while some may prefer less dangerous pursuits, others may be drawn to more thrilling and risky activities.In my opinion, people should be free to engage in any kind of sports or activities of their choice, as long as they are not causing harm to others. This freedom is essential for personal growth, excitement, and the pursuit of one's passions. By allowing individuals to make informed decisions about their own activities, we promote a culture of responsibility and self-awareness. Furthermore, it is crucial to recognize that risk is an inherent aspect of many sports and activities, and that participants often take necessary precautions to mitigate these risks. Therefore, I believe that governments should not ban dangerous sports, but rather, provide education and resources to ensure that participants are aware of the potential risks and consequences involved."
1325;Some people think that hosting an international sporting event is beneficial for a country, while others disagree. Do the advantages of hosting a major sporting event outweigh its disadvantages?;International sporting events are well-known for attracting a high level of attention because they give many people something to look forward to. Understandably, there are advantages and disadvantages for the host country, and careful consideration is required to determine whether a nation will benefit or lose from hosting a major sports championship.Worryingly, the new infrastructure required for hosting a major sporting event often comes at the expense of local people. Their lives get disrupted by construction works and at times residents have even been evicted from their homes for stadiums to be built. Worse still, practice shows the expensive, gigantic buildings constructed for the sports event aren’t being used afterwards and fall into disrepair, leaving the country with high maintenance bills. The financial burden from hosting the Olympic Games, for example, is staggering and can run into tens of billions. Still, the question remains whether or not the pros outnumber the cons.It is hard to underestimate the amount of influence on the country’s global status and prestige that comes with becoming a home to an international sporting event. New trade opportunities appear on the horizon, as it happened for many countries that hosted the Olympic Games. There is also a welcome increase in tourism, which gives the local economy a boost, injecting billions of dollars into the national budget. Construction of new stadiums, hotels and infrastructure such as new roads and rail links creates new jobs, further improving the country’s economy. Less tangible but still important is the aspect of national pride and the feel-good factor associated with hosting an international sports event.All in all, it seems to me that an international sporting event can bring more good than harm to a country, especially if its potential dangers can be avoided or minimised. Hosting a World Championship is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a country and an immense source of pride for its citizens.;The hosting of international sporting events has long been a topic of debate, with some arguing that it brings numerous benefits to a country, while others claim that the drawbacks outweigh the advantages. International sporting events, such as the Olympics and the World Cup, are well-known for attracting a high level of attention because they give many people something to look forward to, fostering a sense of community and national pride. There are several advantages to hosting a major sporting event. For instance, it can lead to an increase in tourism, creating jobs and stimulating local economies. Additionally, the construction of new infrastructure, such as stadiums and transportation systems, can leave a lasting legacy for the host country. However, there are also significant disadvantages to consider. The costs of hosting such an event can be exorbitant, placing a heavy burden on the host country's finances. Furthermore, the event may also disrupt the daily lives of citizens, causing congestion and inconvenience.Careful consideration is required to determine whether a nation will benefit or lose from hosting a major sports championship. While the potential advantages are substantial, the potential drawbacks must also be taken into account. It is crucial for countries to weigh the potential economic, social, and environmental impacts before making a decision. Ultimately, whether the advantages of hosting a major sporting event outweigh its disadvantages depends on a variety of factors, including the country's economic situation, infrastructure, and ability to manage the event effectively. With thorough planning and management, hosting an international sporting event can be a highly rewarding experience for a country, bringing people together and leaving a lasting legacy.
575;Some people think that hosting international sports events may be beneficial for a country. Discuss both views.;Certain people believe that organizing international sports competitions could benefit host countries. While hosting sport events might also entail risks, I firmly believe that nations would gain much more than they would lose, as I will explain below.International sport competitions are usually large events that bring together thousands of people including athletes, staff, and tourists. This usually represents an attractive opportunity for local business and investors. People need to be fed, thus activating restaurants' economy. Additionally, they need a place to sleep and rest, which would benefit hotels. On the other hand, many countries hosting international competitions build new infrastructure, including stadiums, pools, public squares, and even airports. It is clear that several cities around the world have developed as a result of hosting such events. Let us take the example of the city Montreal in Canada, which hosted the olympic games a few decades ago. Organizing sports events also represents an opportunitty to improve the international image of a country. For example, it is not a secret that some countries such as Germany and Russia have used the World Cup to improve their international image, with positive results overall. Finally, since inhabitants of the host nation would feel inspired to practice a new sport, we could argue that competitions could additionally improve the health and wellbeing of citizens in the long term.It is important to mention, however, that hosting sport events might also entail some risks. These competitions are usually complex and expensive to organize, and middle- or low-income economies could better use their resources to build vital infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools. Moreover, examples around the world illustrate that some politicians see these events as an opportunity for curruption.In conclusion, there are more benefits than risks for countries when it comes to hosting international sport events. These events might translate into economic opportunities for local business and investors, could bring new infrastructure, and may trigger development.;The hosting of international sports events has sparked a debate about its potential benefits for a country. On one hand, hosting such events can be highly beneficial. International sport competitions are usually large events that bring together thousands of people, including athletes, staff, and tourists. This influx of visitors can significantly boost the local economy, as they spend money on accommodation, food, and other services. Moreover, many countries hosting international competitions build new infrastructure, including stadiums, pools, public squares, and even airports, which can leave a lasting legacy for the host nation.On the other hand, hosting sport events might also entail some risks. The construction of new infrastructure can be extremely costly, and there is a risk that these facilities may remain underutilized after the event, leading to a significant financial burden on the host country. Additionally, the large influx of visitors can put a strain on the country's resources, including transportation, security, and healthcare. There is also a risk of disruption to the normal functioning of the host city, as well as potential security threats.However, with proper planning and management, the benefits of hosting international sports events can outweigh the risks. Many countries have successfully hosted international events, and have seen significant economic and social benefits as a result. Furthermore, the hosting of such events can also promote cultural exchange and understanding, as people from different countries come together to celebrate their shared love of sports. In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the potential risks of hosting international sports events, the benefits can be substantial, and with careful planning, countries can reap the rewards of hosting these global gatherings.
1017;Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Whilie some people believe that we can live with climate change instead of dealing with that, I don't agree with this idea because climate change can bring various disadvantages for our life.There are many disadvantages of climate change which can gradually push animals and also human to extinction. First and foremost, climate change promote the process of global warming which is one of the most dangerous result of climate change. Because of this situation, ice in 2 polar areas is melting day by day. As a result, the level of sea water will go up. Therefore, countries which are near by the sea may be drown in the future. Another drawback of climate change is that it causes many disaster. The figure for disaster is predicted to increase because of climate change. Hence, people and animals will have to deal with many dangerous disaster which can bring a lot of damage.Beside, I believe there are also many way to prevent climate change. Firstly, from my perspective, education is the best way to deal with the changing of climate. Because education raises the awareness of people about how dangerous climate change is, and it also teach people to protect the environment. Therefore, the effect of climate change will decrease. Secondly, local community should hold more volunteer activity for people to clean the palace where they live, so people can make sense of environmental protection and their neighborhood will also be cleaned. This activity can also contribute to prevent climate changeIn conclusion, I believe that people can't live with climate change and people have to prevent it.;I strongly disagree with the notion that instead of preventing climate change, we should find a way to live with it. Climate change poses significant threats to our planet and its inhabitants, making it essential to take preventive measures rather than adapting to its devastating consequences.Climate change can bring various disadvantages to our lives, affecting not only the environment but also human health, economy, and overall well-being. One of the most alarming effects of climate change is the rapid melting of ice in the two polar areas. This phenomenon is occurring at an unprecedented rate, with drastic consequences. Rising sea levels, caused by the melting of polar ice, put countries near the sea at risk of being drowned in the future. Low-lying areas, such as the Maldives and the Netherlands, are already experiencing frequent flooding, and if left unchecked, climate change could render these places uninhabitable.Moreover, the consequences of climate change are far-reaching and multifaceted. From intense natural disasters like hurricanes and wildfires to unpredictable weather patterns affecting agricultural productivity, the impacts are widespread. Furthermore, climate change is also linked to the spread of diseases, heat stress, and other health issues, which can have a profound impact on human life and the economy.Rather than resigning ourselves to living with climate change, we should focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, investing in renewable energy sources, and implementing sustainable practices. Governments, corporations, and individuals must collaborate to mitigate the effects of climate change. By taking proactive measures, we can avoid the catastrophic outcomes associated with climate change and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come. In conclusion, preventing climate change is not only a moral obligation but a necessity for the survival of our planet.

For example, these people many spend all day sitting on a chair and their work. At the end of a working day, they a backache, and all of their body tired so they need to stretch their arms and improve their health by doing some activity such as going to the gym or swimming.To sum up, the important thing is that people want to stay healthy by choosing what is best for them. In my view, the wrong way is to stay at home in your leisure time if you have a job.;The use of leisure time has been a topic of debate among individuals, with some believing it should be utilized for mentally stimulating activities, while others think it's essential to give the mind a break. As humans, we naturally need to rest during leisure time to alleviate the stress of work and everyday life. This downtime is crucial for rejuvenating our minds and bodies, allowing us to return to our daily tasks with renewed energy and focus.Personally, I prefer to be active during this time because engaging in activities that challenge my mind, such as reading and puzzles, helps me to relax and escape the monotony of daily routines. Moreover, being mentally active during leisure time enables me to learn new things, explore my creativity, and maintain a sense of purpose and fulfillment.Ultimately, people are free to do what they want during their leisure time, and nobody can say what is the best approach.

1215;Some people think that it is important to use leisure time for activities that improve the mind, such as reading and doing word puzzles.Other people feel that it is important to rest the mind during leisure time.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.Write at least 250 words.;Leisure period from our everyday busy schedules is absolutely a well cherished time by most people. What should exactly be done during this free time has been the subject of debate for a while. Some would argue that engaging in simple and less brain tasking activities during this time keeps the mind busy,facilitates mental alertness and sanity.While other scholars would argue that keeping the mind relaxed would improve focus and recharge the mind for when needed at work after the free period has waned off.On the one hand, it seems beneficial to engage in activities that keeps the mind slightly engaged during our leisure period. This is basically due to the fact that some mind consciousness might be lost when idle.Sluggishness may thereforeset in when required to partake in activities that requires full attention. Hence playing chess and games might help maintain ones' awareness during a less busy period. Secondly, getting involved in basic activities like reading and surfing the internet during these free period could also help improve ones intellectual capacity and also overall general knowledge that could well be very beneficial to improving the entire state of the mind.On the other hand, those who say its essential to rest the mind after extensive period of activities might have a point.This is because resting the mind will help recharge Ones' batteries and general condition of the mind. Take for instance, a Tech inclined engineer that uses his mind and brain a lot to profer solutions to complex problems. A liitle period to be calm and relaxed will be of utmost importance to alleviate a potential mind and thoughts exhaustion.In conclusion, while it seems very important and beneficial to rest the mind during leisure period to aid rebooting of the mind and brain.I strongly believe that getting involved is some innovative and creative activities during these period improves our general state of health and mind.;The leisure period from our everyday busy schedules is absolutely a well-cherished time by most people. What should exactly be done during this free time has been the subject of debate for a while. On one hand, some individuals believe that engaging in mentally stimulating activities such as reading and solving puzzles is the best way to utilize leisure time. These activities, they argue, help to improve cognitive function, memory, and concentration, ultimately leading to a more productive and efficient work life. For instance, a person who spends their free time reading books on various subjects can gain a wealth of knowledge, broaden their perspective, and develop critical thinking skills.On the other hand, some scholars would argue that keeping the mind relaxed would improve focus and recharge the mind for when needed at work after the free period has waned off. According to them, excessive mental activity during leisure time can lead to mental fatigue, which may negatively impact performance and productivity in the long run. They suggest that engaging in relaxing activities such as meditation, yoga, or simply taking a walk can help calm the mind, reduce stress, and increase overall well-being. I tend to agree with the latter view. In my opinion, leisure time is essential for rejuvenating both the body and the mind. After a long period of intense mental activity, a break from mentally demanding tasks can help prevent burnout and maintain a healthy work-life balance.In conclusion, while both perspectives have valid points, I believe that resting the mind during leisure time is crucial for maintaining mental health and productivity. By allowing ourselves time to relax and recharge, we can return to our tasks with renewed energy, focus, and creativity, ultimately leading to a more fulfilling and successful life. Therefore, it is essential to strike a balance between mental stimulation and relaxation during our cherished leisure time.
865;Some people think that it is more beneficial to take part in sports which are played in teams, like football, while other people think that taking part in individual sports, like tennis or swimming, is better. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Sport play an essential role in shaping the personality of individual. Some people believe that sports which are played in teams are more beneficial like football, while others think that solo sports like tennis or swimming is better. The following essay will discuss both arguments and give my opinion that sports which are played in teams have more advantages over solo sport activites.First of all, there is no doubt that the individual sport activities enahnce people confidence. It helps building the personality and strentghen the mentality of the individuals. For examole, one role model in my home country was playing tennis table, he mentioned once in an interview, that sport helped him not only to win trophies but it raised his mental strength and shaped his pesonality.However, some people believe that, sports which are played in teamshave more advantages and all community will get the benefits. Soccer, for example, will help the players specifically the young children to understand working together and sharing the responsibility. In addition people will grow with better understanding to the concept of sharing achievements which can improve all the community. For instance, i was a member of soccer team in high school, me and my friends were taught, in order to win games we should put plans together and work as one unit. Furthermore, it helps me later in my career to understand the meaning of leadership and how the sharing responsibility and working together could bring the success to our endeavour.To conclude, solo sport can bring proud and honour to individuals butsports which played in teams teach people the meaning of working together which will improve the community in the future.;The debate about whether team sports or individual sports are more beneficial has sparked a lot of discussion. While some argue that participating in individual sports like tennis or swimming is better, others claim that team sports such as football have more advantages. In this essay, we will discuss both views and provide an opinion on the matter.On the one hand, individual sports activities undoubtedly enhance people's confidence. Engaging in solo sports helps build the personality and strengthen the mentality of individuals. For instance, a tennis player or a swimmer relies solely on themselves to achieve victory, which can greatly boost their self-esteem and mental toughness. Moreover, individual sports often require a high level of discipline and self-motivation, which can translate to other areas of life. However, despite these benefits, individual sports lack the camaraderie and social interaction that team sports provide.On the other hand, team sports offer a unique set of advantages that outweigh those of individual sports. Team sports foster a sense of community, teamwork, and communication among players. For example, football players must work together, rely on each other's strengths, and cover each other's weaknesses to achieve a common goal. This teamwork not only enhances social skills but also promotes a strong work ethic, adaptability, and problem-solving skills. Furthermore, team sports provide a support system where players can learn from each other, share experiences, and grow together. In my opinion, sports which are played in teams have more advantages over solo sports activities. The benefits of teamwork, social interaction, and mutual support make team sports a more rewarding and beneficial experience for individuals. In conclusion, while individual sports have their benefits, team sports offer a more comprehensive and enriching experience that can shape individuals in multiple aspects of life.
765;Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children’s development than playing computer games. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Some individuals believe that playing outside has a more positive effect on children's development rather than playing computer games. I share the idea that being involved in outdoor activities is more beneficial than playing computer games.Active development is the main reason for including outdoor activities in children's life. All people know that the development of children is an extremely significant part of building a personality. To do so parents should try to involve their children in exploring local insects, animals or playing different games such as football, riding bicycles, and many other. This will only expand the knowledge of children, and consequently have a positive effect on their development. This is also important to have a healthy generation in the future. Parents can join their children or they can find some friends around and also be socially active. For example, a father can teach his son how to bicycle or how to take care of plants and trees.The next important reason for doing more outdoor activities for children is avoiding physical problems, which can cause computer games. Currently, a lot of people including children suffer from different side effects of a lazy lifestyle and obesity can exemplify it. To avoid problems with physical health in the future, spending a couple of hours should be recommended to all children.Of course, little time spent playing computer games will not hurt children, but it is important to limit it. To sum up, children should do more outdoor activities and play computer games less.;The debate about whether outdoor activities or playing computer games is more beneficial for children's development has sparked a lot of discussion. In my opinion, I strongly agree that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children's development than playing computer games. First and foremost, active development is the main reason why children should prioritize outdoor activities over computer games. Outdoor activities, such as sports, hiking, or simply playing in a park, enable children to develop physically, mentally, and emotionally. They learn important life skills like teamwork, communication, and problem-solving, which are essential for their overall development. In contrast, computer games can only provide a limited range of benefits, mostly related to cognitive development.Another significant reason why children should do more outdoor activities and play computer games less is to avoid physical problems that can arise from excessive gaming. Spending too much time playing computer games can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity, poor eyesight, and other health issues. On the other hand, outdoor activities promote physical exercise, which is crucial for maintaining a healthy weight, building strong bones and muscles, and enhancing overall well-being. By engaging in outdoor activities, children can reduce their risk of developing these physical problems and develop healthy habits that will last a lifetime.In conclusion, I firmly believe that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children's development than playing computer games. With the benefits of active development and the avoidance of physical problems, it is clear that children should prioritize outdoor activities. Parents and caregivers should encourage children to spend more time outdoors and limit their screen time to ensure they develop into happy, healthy, and well-rounded individuals.
613;Some people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;It is often argued out there about sports, debating about both physcial and mental strengths and which is far more crucial to the success. This essay will go over these two points of view in further depth and outline some expamples, where relevant, for each.On one side, some people think that the most important factor to succeeding in sports is the physical strength. Body strength is actually quite indispensable in any sport activity, especially those types of sports that demand a high fitness level and high physical endurance, etc, such as MMA fights, wrestling, football, and so on. All of these require an elevated and advanced charachterestics of one's body. For example, an athlete can not keep up a football match and running around for 90 minutes without a high body endurance, fitness, so on and so forth.On the other hand, the others believe that a powerful mentality and mindset are needed for such success and accomplishment. That is, they believe that one's attitude is the first key to success before anything else. People need to have some sort of a mindset with specific qualities, such as perseverance, determination, concentration, etc. and it's not always about havign a massive body strength. For example, some MMA athletes step in the ring with solid bodies, will not always win the games if they're not determined and persistent already, altought their opponents do not have that huge bodies. It's all about the mindset.In conclusion, it's not easy to decide which of these two criteria is more important than the other. However, I believe that any athlete must have these two, train them both before getting into any challenge, no matter what type of activity. An athlete must have a strong body and a trained attitude once and for all.;The debate about what contributes to success in sports has been ongoing, with some people arguing that physical strength is the key factor, while others believe that mental strength is more crucial. On the one hand, some people think that the most important factor to succeeding in sports is the physical strength. This is because physical strength enables athletes to perform at high intensities, withstand physical demands, and recover quickly from injuries. For example, sports like rugby and boxing require a certain level of physical strength to compete effectively. Athletes with superior physical strength often have an advantage over their opponents, allowing them to outperform and outlast them.On the other hand, others believe that a powerful mentality and mindset are needed for such success and accomplishment. Mental strength allows athletes to push through challenges, as it gives them the resilience, focus, and confidence to perform under pressure. It also enables them to develop strategies, make quick decisions, and maintain a positive attitude, even in the face of adversity. For instance, athletes like tennis players and golfers need mental toughness to stay focused and composed during high-pressure competitions.In conclusion, it's not easy to decide which of these two criteria is more important than the other. Both physical and mental strength are essential components of success in sports, and they often go hand-in-hand. A balance between the two is likely the key to achieving success, as physical strength without mental toughness can lead to burnout, while mental strength without physical strength can limit an athlete's potential. Ultimately, a combination of both physical and mental strength is necessary for athletes to reach their full potential and succeed in their respective sports.
1386;Some people think that students who don’t take a break in studies between the high school and the university are at disadvantage compared to students who travel and work after high school before further continuing their education. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, in our competitive world, to succeed, knowledge from school and university is not enough. Therefore, students who study from the school to university get fewer benefits and contribute less too, compared to those who travel or work and get experience and skills . There are two following reasons to support for my opinion. I refer to the group of people who study from school to university as ‘group A’ and the other group – as ‘group B’.Firstly, at school and university, what group A gains is almost entirely theory, theory and theory. Of course, theory is very , however, you can’t do everything with just theory. You must have experience. This is what group A . Although in the third or fourth year at university, group A can be apprentices in some companies, to help them approach their future jobs, they aren’t trained well because of the short time spent working. And the real job is still very strange to them. After graduating, without experience, group A students can’t accomplish their work perfectly. On the other hand, it takes them time and money to keep up with other experienced students and they may be scorned. Therefore, group A students can contribute less than group B who have the two most important things: skills and experience.Secondly, as group A students are contributing less, they surely get less benefit. Moreover, many companies which employ people in group A have to train them from ground-up. These companies take this cost from group A’s salary to reduce the risk of their employees leaving to other companies after being trained. So, less benefits are unavoidable and certain, group B members are more loyal and effective workers. They also have useful experience and skills. Besides, their education is the same as or even higher than that of group A. As the result, group B gets more benefits absolutely.In conclusion, I think a student should travel or work before going to the university. That way, not only will they have basic knowledge but also skills and experience which are useful for them to get a good job and have a brilliant future.;In today's fast-paced and competitive world, the path to success is no longer linear. While pursuing education without interruption may seem like the most straightforward route, I firmly believe that students who transition directly from high school to university are at a disadvantage compared to those who take a break to travel and work. The reason behind this disparity lies in the fact that knowledge acquired solely through schooling is insufficient to thrive in our complex and dynamic society.To succeed, individuals need to possess a broad range of skills, experiences, and perspectives that extend beyond the confines of academic institutions. Students who dive straight into university after high school may accumulate theoretical knowledge, but they lack the practical, real-world experiences that their counterparts, who take a gap year, gain. By traveling and working, these students develop invaluable life skills such as independence,,assistantIn today's fast-paced and competitive world, the path to success is no longer linear. While pursuing education without interruption may seem like the most straightforward route, I firmly believe that students who transition directly from high school to university are at a disadvantage compared to those who take a break to travel and work. The reason behind this disparity lies in the fact that knowledge acquired solely through schooling is insufficient to thrive in our complex and dynamic society.To succeed, knowledge from school and university is not enough. Therefore, students who study from school to university without any break get fewer benefits and contribute less too. They may excel academically, but they often lack the interpersonal skills, adaptability, and emotional intelligence that are cultivated through diverse life experiences. On the other hand, students who take a gap year to explore the world and engage in professional internships or jobs, return to their academic pursuits with a renewed sense of purpose, enhanced creativity, and a more nuanced understanding of the real-world applications of their studies.By stepping out of the academic bubble, these individuals gain a unique perspective on their field of interest, making them more innovative thinkers and problem-solvers. Moreover, the break allows them to recharge, reflect on their goals, and make more informed decisions about their academic and professional pathways. As a result, they are more likely to make meaningful contributions to their chosen fields and society at large. In conclusion, while direct progression from high school to university may seem like the most efficient route, I strongly agree that taking a break to travel and work provides students with the holistic development and competitive edge they need to truly succeed in our competitive world.
1281;Some people think that the most important thing about being rich is it gives a person the opportunity to help other people.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Helping other people in society is noble goal ,to some people it's a big achievement .However rebuilding personality of individuals and giving them an opportunity to leave an influence in the community is reflecting the genuien humanity .Therefore i agree with notion that rich people who are, in fact have the ability to offer the help for orthers in order to recreate healthy environment for everbody to work in our society .The following essay will illuminate the reason behind my opinion .Regrettably . many people suffer form disadvantages situtaions nowdays like losing jobs or money ,they find themselves have no energy or motive to contiune and to help their families . As a result of that poverty propagates in some society and usually accompany with low level availability of education . Hence to avoid falling into misery, some countries nowdays help non governmenrtal organizations and institutions to give assist to poor communities in a manner to raise education and develop health sector. For instance , Red Cross and Save the children , both organizations offere help and leverage human rebuild personality which no doubt will enrich these communities with several benefits .In spite of green vevet picture that mentioned above , some people think that helping people alone is not enough . However , others believe that no matter how grim or daunting things may seem , if the individual have the courage to move a head , then everything is possible . Nevertheless people can find the motive inside eventhoughlife handed them a toughest time . For example Helen Keller .An American Author , although she born with disability but she could be one of greatest authors in western history .In summary , no doubt that people should have the courage to move a head whether they find help from others or not . However people who can offer the help will make our community live peacefully and bring prosperity to our offsprings .;The notion that the most important aspect of being rich is the opportunity it provides to help others is a topic of debate. In my opinion, I strongly agree with this statement. Helping other people in society is a noble goal, and to some individuals, it is a big achievement. However, the true essence of wealth lies not just in providing financial assistance, but also in rebuilding the personality of individuals and giving them an opportunity to leave a lasting influence in the community. This, in my view, reflects genuine humanity.When wealthy individuals use their resources to support and uplift others, they are not only improving the lives of those they help, but also contributing to the betterment of society as a whole. For instance, philanthropists like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have utilized their wealth to establish foundations that work towards eradicating diseases, improving education, and promoting equality. Their efforts have not only changed countless lives but have also inspired others to follow in their footsteps, thereby creating a ripple effect of kindness and generosity.Therefore, I agree with the notion that rich people, who are indeed capable of offering help to others, have a significant role to play in recreating a healthy environment for everybody to thrive in our society. By doing so, they set an example for others to emulate, fostering a culture of empathy, compassion, and social responsibility. Ultimately, the true measure of one's wealth is not in the amount of money they possess, but in the positive impact they have on the lives of others and the community at large.
1081;Some people think that there should be strict laws to control the amount of noise a person makes because of the disturbance it causes to people.Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;With the increasing population in cities,noise pollution has been one of the important causes of concern.This essay presents the advantages and disadvantages of the strict laws that are made to control noise pollution.Noise pollution affects different groups of people in various ways.The increasing noise in recent days has led to increasing problems of hearing impairment in people in today's society.Also,the noise pollution has a devastating affects on the heart patients and it has been affecting people who are working and studying in various ways.By implementing strict rules like imposing heavy fines on vehicles honking unnecessarily and filing a case on the noise caused by the public gatherings like rallies,the above problems can be addressed.For example, recent studies have shown that the cities having less noise pollution have been leading better life when compared to those with noise pollution.However,implementing strict laws on noise caused by a person also has some disadvantages.Firstly,different religions have different kinds of festivals which cause a lot of noise.For instance,diwali,one of the most celebrated festivals in India,is celebrated by firing crackers causing a lot of noise is affected by implementing these laws.Secondly,most of the people with religious beliefs will have a bad impact by these rules.To give an example,the prayers in masjids are made with loud noise so that it can reach a large group of people living in the area.To conclude,implemeting strict rules like fines and filing a case on the people causing noise pollution have a good impact on the health of the society and increasing the efficiency of work where as the festivals and the religious centres have a negative impact by these laws.;The notion of implementing strict laws to control the amount of noise a person makes has sparked a heated debate. On one hand, the advantages of such laws are evident. Excessive noise can be a significant disturbance to people, especially in residential areas, causing sleep deprivation, stress, and decreased productivity. For instance, strict noise laws can help mitigate the disturbance caused by loud music or parties that go late into the night, thereby improving the overall quality of life for residents. Moreover, such laws can also help protect people from the negative impacts of noise pollution on their health, such as hearing loss and cardiovascular diseases.However, implementing strict laws on noise caused by a person also has some disadvantages. Firstly, different religions have different kinds of festivals which cause a lot of noise. For example, the Hindu festival of Diwali, the Muslim festival of Eid, and the Christian festival of Christmas, all involve loud celebrations and prayers. Implementing strict noise laws could potentially stifle these cultural and religious expressions, leading to resentment and social unrest. Secondly, the prayers in masjids are made with loud noise so that it can reach a large group of people living in the area. This is an essential part of Islamic worship and restricting it could be seen as an infringement on religious freedom. Furthermore, enforcing strict noise laws could also lead to unnecessary fines and penalties for individuals who are simply expressing themselves or practicing their faith. It is essential to strike a balance between maintaining a peaceful environment and respecting the rights and traditions of individuals. Perhaps, a more nuanced approach, such as setting specific quiet hours or noise levels, would be more effective in addressing the issue of noise disturbance while also respecting cultural and religious diversity. Ultimately, any laws or regulations implemented should prioritize the well-being and rights of all individuals, rather than imposing overly restrictive measures.
1431;Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than with a teacher. Others think that it is always better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.;It is certainly said that learning is an ongoing process .Every person something new their age, experience, knowledge and education. According to my point of view it is always better to have teacher or guide for study.One teacher has adequate knowledge to teach their student. knows ways to make subject easier for the students, moreover, he teaches them in an effective manner. For example, some students are weak in some subjects but a teacher them according to their mental capacity. . Some people can learn better in the topics with others. In class people can the views of others, . .In the today’s competitive world, everybody is busy, some people think that their time classes they can learn better their subject . They can attend online classes by using the Internet at home. They can get relevant information from the Internet regarding their topic. There is specific time or age limit to learn something new. Some new things we can only learn from experience – for example new facts, new habits and so on., I would like to say that it is always better for the people to have a teacher because a teacher has good knowledge, experience and is educated how to teach others. People will learn from a teacher in an easier way rather than on their own.;It is certainly said that learning is an ongoing process. Every person learns something new, regardless of their age, experience, knowledge, and education. In today's world, where information is readily available, some people believe that they can learn better by themselves, while others think that having a teacher is essential. According to my point of view, it is always better to have a teacher or guide for study.Having a teacher provides numerous benefits that self-study cannot match. Firstly, a teacher can offer personalized guidance, helping students to understand complex concepts and address their weaknesses. They can also provide valuable feedback, which is crucial for improvement and progress. Moreover, a teacher can help students stay motivated and focused, setting goals and deadlines to ensure they remain on track. Additionally, a teacher can share their own experiences and insights, providing real-life examples and applications of the subject matter.On the other hand, self-study can lead to misconceptions and misunderstandings, as learners may not fully comprehend the material without guidance. Furthermore, self-study lacks the interactive element, where students can engage in discussions, ask questions, and learn from their peers. A teacher can facilitate this interaction, creating a collaborative learning environment that fosters growth and development.In conclusion, while self-study has its advantages, I firmly believe that having a teacher or guide is essential for effective learning. The guidance, feedback, and motivation provided by a teacher are invaluable, and can significantly enhance the learning experience. As learning is a lifelong process, having a teacher can help individuals navigate this journey, ensuring they acquire new skills, knowledge, and perspectives in the best possible way.
693;Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Space, so unknown for the humankind that it generates so much curiosity among experts and enterprenues. Due to this curiosity, the amount of resources and money invested in its exploration is surprisingly big. Developing technology for it is expensive but, in my humble opinion, completly justified.Firstly, developing technology is vital so that space exploration can be carried out succesfully. Experts have discovered that we only know a 4 percent of the entire universe. If with only that 4 percent we have accomplished amazing achievements, imagine what the human race could do when knowing a 10 percent.Secondly, space exploration and the technology involve on it not only will help the human race understand the universe but also will provide a whole new kind of tourism, space tourism. The CEOs of some of the most profitable business in America are investigating this possibility. The leading enterprises in this sector are Blue Origin from Jeff Bezos and Space X from Elon Musk. When discovered the way of sending people to space safely, space tourism will generate twice the money spent on technology for space exploration.In a nutshell, space exploration is crutial for the development of the human race. Furthermore, if this was not enough, all the technology developed will serve the purpose of creating a whole new kind of tourism that will generate billions of dollars in revenue. From my point of view, even though here on earth there are several problems to be solve with money, our future lies on space, so be must spend as much money as possible.;The investment in space exploration has sparked a heated debate, with some arguing that the vast amount of resources and money allocated to this endeavor is not justified. However, I strongly disagree with this perspective. The amount of resources and money invested in space exploration is surprisingly big, with billions of dollars being spent annually. Nevertheless, developing technology for space exploration is expensive, but in my humble opinion, it is completely justified.The benefits of space exploration extend far beyond the initial investment. For instance, the technological advancements that arise from this research have numerous practical applications in our daily lives, such as improved telecommunications, medical technology, and environmental monitoring. Moreover, space exploration and the technology involved in it will provide a whole new kind of tourism - space tourism. This emerging industry is expected to create new job opportunities, stimulate economic growth, and inspire future generations to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).Space tourism will not only allow people to experience the thrill of space travel but also provide a unique perspective on our planet, fostering a greater appreciation for the fragility and beauty of Earth. Furthermore, the long-term goal of space exploration is to ensure the survival of humanity, by potentially providing a new home for our species. In conclusion, while the cost of developing technology for space exploration is substantial, I firmly believe that it is a worthwhile investment. The potential benefits, including the creation of a new tourism industry, make it an endeavor that is not only justified but essential for the advancement of human knowledge and progress.
1309;Some people today believe that it is acceptable to use physical force to discipline children, but others feel it is completely unacceptable.Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Punishing children with physical force, or corporal punishment as it is also called, is something that was accepted not so long ago and people over the age of forty may well remember it. Nowadays, however, corporal punishment is against the law in most countries and adults who practise it can be taken to court. Children are always a vulnerable group and they depend on adults for protection and education. Of course, part of the growing up process is testing and breaking boundaries and it is nearly always necessary to instill discipline on a child. Whether or not it is necessary to use physical force to do so can be a very emotive subject.Supporters of corporal punishment often defend their standpoint by explaining that the corporal punishment is not, or should not be, excessive. They do not argue that a child should be beaten severely until he or she is bruised or cut. They argue that just the infliction of mild pain causes effective discipline and also the fear that it might be applied. People who grew up experiencing it might offer this point of view.Those who oppose using physical force on a child would say that the vulnerability and innocence of a child means that force should never be used. Children need to trust adults and believe that no harm will come to them. Additionally, children learn from adults and it is argued that corporal punishment will only teach children that force is an answer to various problems. It is also claimed that corporal punishment has no added benefits over other forms of discipline that do not require physical force. Using it can cause psychological harm to children and should be classed as child abuse.Personally, I do not believe that limited use of forms of corporal punishment can cause harm, and a parent who administers a mild form of it to his or her child should not be subject to criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, I would not use it myself. I can also recognise the possibilities of adults who are not a child’s parents misusing corporal punishment. Therefore, I believe that on balance physical force to discipline children should not be permitted.;The use of physical force to discipline children is a highly debated topic, with some people believing it is acceptable and others considering it completely unacceptable. In my opinion, the latter view is more compelling, and I strongly believe that physical force should never be used to discipline children. One of the primary reasons for this stance is that corporal punishment is against the law in most countries, and adults who practise it can be taken to court. This legal stance is a clear indication that society as a whole does not condone the use of physical force against children. Furthermore, it is argued that the vulnerability and innocence of a child means that force should never be used, as it can cause long-term physical and emotional harm to the child. Children look up to adults for protection and guidance, and using physical force can undermine this trust and relationship.However, some argue that a parent who administers a mild form of corporal punishment to his or her child should not be subject to criminal proceedings, as their intention is to discipline and not to harm. While I can understand this perspective, I would not use corporal punishment myself. I believe that there are more effective and safer ways to discipline children, such as positive reinforcement, time-outs, and open communication. These methods not only help children understand what they did wrong but also teach them important life skills like self-regulation and responsibility.In conclusion, while the use of physical force to discipline children is a complex issue with different viewpoints, I firmly believe that it is unacceptable. The potential harm, both physical and emotional, and the legal implications make it a practice that should be avoided. As a society, we should focus on promoting positive and non-violent discipline methods that prioritize the well-being, safety, and development of children.
1358;Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems, is this a positive or negative development?;Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems. Is it a positive or negative development? Give your own opinion and examples from your experience.At present, the Internet plays a vital role in almost every aspect of human life. As a result, individuals are searching online reasonable solutions to their illnesses. Not everyone is convinced that access to such information online is safe and helpful. However, in my view, providing the general public with access to trustworthy information about medical disorders would invariably improve the quality of the medical care for the whole society.Nowadays, even though there are plenty of online platforms developed for medical education, most of the sites have not been written by professional healthcare providers. Hence, there is a high possibility of spreading wrong medical information throughout the world, unless the site developers are held accountable for the content they provide. If patients receive incorrect information about a medical procedure and follow the wrong advice, for instance, to remove a wart at home, it might lead to a serious infection, excessive bleeding or another medical emergency. That would constitute a negative effect of using online knowledge for medical treatments at home rather than visiting a professional.On the flip side, the Internet, the society is well aware of most common medical disorders and preventive measures. Consequently, a reasonable and prudent individual can decide whether to get professional opinion on one’s disease or to handle it at home, that they get reliable online medical information. Moreover, if patients can manage mild medical problems themselves, it would certainly reduce the workload at the local hospitals, freeing more doctors for patients in real need. Besides, if patients come with a certain extent of knowledge about their condition to the medical consultation, it would invariably be helpful to the medical practitioner for effective decision making.To sum up, it is evident that online search for information on medical disorders can be a positive development as long as the general public receives trustworthy information.This response addresses the topic well. The writer’s position is clearly explained and supported, the information is organised in paragraphs in an easy to follow way, and use of linking words is appropriate. A range of complex sentence forms is used and there are very few errors in word choice or word formation (underlined in blue). Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.;The advent of the Internet has revolutionized the way people access information, including medical knowledge. Some individuals have taken to using the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems, a development that has sparked debate about its merits. In my opinion, this trend is a double-edged sword, bearing both positive and negative aspects.On the positive side, the Internet provides an unprecedented wealth of medical information that can empower patients. For instance, it allows them to research their symptoms, understand their diagnoses better, and explore various treatment options. This can lead to more informed decisions and a more active role in their healthcare. Personally, I have seen family members use online resources to manage chronic conditions more effectively, such as finding diet plans and exercise routines tailored to their specific needs.However, the negative aspects of this development cannot be overlooked. Relying solely on Internet searches for medical solutions can lead to misinformation, as not all online sources are credible or up-to-date. This can result in misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, potentially worsening health outcomes. I have known individuals who, after self-diagnosing through Internet research, delayed seeking professional medical help, only to find their conditions had progressed significantly.In conclusion, while the Internet can be a valuable tool for exploring medical issues, it is crucial that its use is balanced with professional medical advice. Patients should use online resources to inform themselves but ultimately rely on healthcare professionals for diagnoses and treatment plans. By doing so, the benefits of Internet-based medical research can be harnessed while minimizing its risks. Ultimately, a balanced approach is key to leveraging this development positively.
949;Some say that because many people are living much longer, the age at which people retire from work should be raised considerably.To what extent do you agree or disagree?;People nowadays are living much longer.With the discovering of new medicine and with the innovation in the medical field, the life expectancy of a person skyrocketed over the last decade.Some people might think that the consequence of this phenomenon should be the fact that the age at which people retire from work ought to be raised considerably.I don't agree with this idea.Rather than involving the life expectancy of a person, we should consider the job itself.Is it tiring? Does it require a person to be able to react immediately to a potential problem?If the job is tiring I think that it would be better for a person to retire. If you end up being worn out every day because your job is very exhausting the life expectancy should not be the fact that decides if you have or not the right to retire.The question ought to be: Is the person physically and mentally able to cope with the work?The older you get the slower you become. This is another pivotal factor that should be taken into account when deciding the retirement age of a person.The ability to react to dangerous events keeps the working environment under control.Let's imagine a carpenter working on the construction of a new building.What if a wall suddenly falls? Does an elderly person react faster than a younger worker?I am an optimistic person but I would stick to my guns in this scenario betting on the younger person.I would like to wrap up this essay by saying that I could have thought of many more reasons that explain why the age at which people retire from work should not be based entirely on the fact that people are living longer.Of course, this can not be ignored but basing this decision only on this fact it is seen by me as a poor approach.;The notion that the retirement age should be raised considerably due to the increasing lifespan of individuals has sparked a heated debate. It is undeniable that people nowadays are living much longer, thanks to the groundbreaking discoveries in medicine and the innovative advancements in the medical field. Over the last decade, life expectancy has skyrocketed, and this trend is expected to continue. As a result, some people argue that the age at which people retire from work should be increased substantially to reflect this new reality.However, I disagree with this idea. While it is true that people are living longer, I believe that the decision to raise the retirement age should not be based solely on longevity. Instead, we should consider the nature of the job itself. Certain professions, such as those in the manufacturing or construction industries, are physically demanding and can take a toll on an individual's health. Raising the retirement age for these workers could lead to burnout, decreased productivity, and increased health problems.On the other hand, jobs that are less physically demanding, such as those in the service or knowledge-based sectors, may be more suitable for older workers. Ultimately, the decision to raise the retirement age should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the specific requirements and demands of each job. Rather than implementing a blanket policy, we should focus on creating a more flexible and adaptable retirement system that caters to the diverse needs of workers across various industries. By doing so, we can ensure that individuals are able to retire with dignity and security, while also acknowledging the changing demographics and workforce needs.
1389;Some say that the Internet is making the world smaller by bringing people together. To what extent do to you agree that the Internet is making it easier for people to communicate with one another?;"A global village, that is certainly what the world feels like nowadays. With the help of the , you can reach out and get to know people you might never have met in person. Articles can be co-authored, business deals can be finalized, degrees can be earned and at times even medical advice can be given- and all of this is just a click away.Electronic mail, instant messages, web cameras and microphones; all these gadgets and programs make the presence of the other person more real. Who knows; with the help of visual reality you might even get a 3-D image of the speaker! I believe that the Internet is one the best inventions of the last century, you can hardly get to miss anyone and nobody is really out of reach. You can keep in touch with your friends, and be able to do your work from your bedroom in your pajamas!However, the internet can also be a major source of harassment. Spammers and hackers can invade your privacy and get personal/confidential information, which otherwise they never get access to. You are never out of anybody’s reach, unless you make a conscious decision of not checking your email, there can be always more work waiting for you in your inbox and you might never have a moment to yourself. Worse yet, if you were a workaholic, you might never experience that stress-free vacation ever again in your life – simply, because you have your mobile workplace with you at all times.As a romantic, I will always look forward to getting an occasional letter in the snail mail. A personal letter, where I can sense the mood of the writer by the slants in his/her handwriting and get to know him/her better. But as a type A personality person, the internet gives me all what I dream of in terms of communication – the speed, reliability, and convenience of time and place. I can certainly tolerate its shortcomings any day, as long as it keeps me close to my loved ones.";The advent of the Internet is undoubtedly one of the best inventions of the last century, revolutionizing the way people communicate with one another. The Internet has made the world smaller by bridging geographical gaps and facilitating global connectivity. With just a few clicks, one can easily get in touch with friends, family, and colleagues who are physically miles apart. In fact, you can hardly miss anyone and nobody is really out of reach, as long as they have an internet connection. This has been particularly beneficial for people who live in remote areas or have loved ones living abroad, as it enables them to stay in touch and maintain relationships that would otherwise be difficult to sustain.However, while the Internet has made communication easier and more convenient, it also has a darker side. The Internet can also be a major source of harassment, with spammers and hackers posing a significant threat to individuals' privacy and security. These malicious individuals can invade one's privacy and gain access to personal and confidential information, which they would otherwise never have been able to obtain. This can have serious consequences, including identity theft, financial fraud, and emotional distress. Therefore, while the Internet has undoubtedly made it easier for people to communicate with one another, it is crucial to acknowledge the potential risks and take necessary precautions to ensure safe and secure online interactions. Ultimately, the Internet is a powerful tool that has transformed the way we communicate, but it is up to us to use it responsibly and mitigate its potential downsides.
655;Some systems require students to specialize in a limited range of subjects from the age of fifteen. Other systems require students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?;"Education programs are different from one area to another area, there are systems that learners are required to choose restricted number of courses for their academic curriculum by the age of 15.while,other educational systems ask students to take comprehensive courses until they graduate from school. There are many positives for both trends, in my opinion limited range of academic subjects education system is better.On the one hand, it is basic knowledge to accept the idea that pupils who study selected number of subjects from age of fifteen are more informative academically in specified field of study. For example, when student decide to take medical subjects from early age the student will be prepared by tutors completely for the nominated curriculum,as a result all the student's focus will be on medical topics thus, the student is more qualified to practice medicine more efficiently after school graduation.Furthermore, this system will build a solid knowledge background in limited range of subjects can help to develop creativity at early age.Moreover, in the financial view point it may be better for students to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15; selected number of academic subjects means less money allocated for educational services by guardians.On the other hand, it is true to claim that general subjects system can prepare students to be more informative in various different live aspects. Since, students who register with wide range subjects system can gain academic knowledge and support in fields such as mathematics,physics,medicine,and....ect. Therefore,those students can select more than one speciality to practice as a professionalism in future.Besides, wide range system help to improve social interactions better,because friends will not be separated and they continue school education together until graduation,inaddition there is chance to make more friends as primises are more crowded.To sum up, educational systems main target is to develop and progress academic background of students.But, in my opinion,it is better to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15 due to reasons like: solid academic background in specific field,creativity,and less financial burden on parents.";The education system has been a topic of debate for many years, with different countries adopting varying approaches to cater to the needs of their students. Two prominent systems that exist are those that require students to specialize in a limited range of subjects from the age of fifteen, and those that demand students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. Both systems have their benefits, but in my opinion, the system that requires students to specialize in a limited range of subjects is better.On one hand, the system that requires students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school has its advantages. This approach allows students to explore various fields of study, helping them to discover their interests and strengths. It also provides a well-rounded education, enabling students to develop a broad range of skills and knowledge. Additionally, this system prepares students for an ever-changing world, where adaptability and flexibility are crucial.On the other hand, the system that requires students to specialize in a limited range of subjects from the age of fifteen has several benefits. By focusing on a restricted number of courses, students can delve deeper into their chosen subjects, gaining a more comprehensive understanding and developing specialized skills. This approach also allows students to pursue their passions and interests at an early age, leading to increased motivation and engagement. Furthermore, specializing in a limited range of subjects can provide students with a clearer direction and focus, making them more prepared for higher education and their future careers.In my opinion, the limited range of academic subjects education system is better. By allowing students to specialize in a restricted number of courses, they can develop a deeper understanding of their chosen subjects and pursue their passions at an early age. This approach can lead to increased motivation, engagement, and preparation for higher education and future careers. While both systems have their positives, the benefits of specializing in a limited range of subjects outweigh those of studying a wide range of subjects.
1347;Some think that children should leave their family home as soon as possible while others believe they should stay for as long as they like (discuss);Some people think that it is best to encourage children to leave their family home as soon as possible. Others believe children should stay at the family home for as long as they like. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayAlthough it is thought by some that urging young people to abandon their family home at an early age is beneficial for them, others believe that it is better if children stay with their families for longer. In my opinion, leaving family home early has many advantages for children.On the one people think that youngsters ought to leave their parents’ house so as to learn life skills at an early age. Their reasoning is that it should push young people towards independence and make them learn from life lessons rather than merely rely on their parents. For example, students who pursue tertiary study away from their home city might learn taking personal responsibility. Also, living independently will teach children a lot by presenting some difficulties, which, consequently, will add some more experience that may prove essential in their future lives.On the other hand, it is argued that children should stay with their parents for longer for several reasons. Firstly, young people need advice from adults, and no one would be better suited to that than their parents. Secondly, life can be generally harsh, for children in particular. In other words, they might or take unnecessary risks if they mix with the wrong crowd. It is commonly known that young people tend to be by unethical people. To avoid that, being under parental supervision is utterly important for children.To sum up, while people’s opinions may vary, I believe that young people should leave their family home at an early age, while parents ought to provide them with appropriate advice and keep an eye on their well-being.This essay covers the task by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of leaving the family home early in life, and the writer’s opinion has been clearly stated. The arguments for and against have been organised in paragraphs and supported by examples. Accuracy of expression needs some work (see suggested corrections underlined in blue) and in one case sentence structure needs more attention. Overall, assuming the errors were corrected, this essay could score Band 8 in IELTS.;The question of when children should leave their family home has sparked a heated debate. Some people think that it is best to encourage children to leave their family home as soon as possible, as this helps them develop independence and self-reliance. According to this view, leaving the family home early allows children to take responsibility for their own lives, make their own decisions, and learn from their mistakes. This, in turn, prepares them for the challenges of adulthood and enables them to become more confident and self-sufficient individuals.On the other hand, others believe that children should stay at the family home for as long as they like. They argue that the family home provides a sense of security, comfort, and support that is essential for children's emotional and psychological well-being. Staying at home for an extended period also allows children to pursue their education and career goals without the burden of financial responsibilities, such as rent and bills. Moreover, it enables them to maintain strong family bonds and receive guidance and mentorship from their parents.In my opinion, I think that the decision of when to leave the family home should be based on individual circumstances and needs. While independence and self-reliance are important, they should not come at the cost of emotional and financial stability. Children should be encouraged to leave the family home when they are emotionally and financially ready, and not before. Ultimately, a balanced approach that takes into account the needs and capabilities of each child is the most effective way to ensure a smooth transition into adulthood.
1333;Some think that young people should be free to choose any career they like, while others say that they should think more realistically about their future. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;"Choosing a future career requires careful consideration. While some people claim that adolescents should be able to pursue a career they would enjoy, others oppose to that, arguing that teenagers should aim for a high-paying job in order to secure a livelihood when they grow up. Given that our life consists of more than just physiological needs, I strongly believe that it is vital to fulfill one’s potential in the career fields that are most compatible with their interests.The youth who choose highly skilled jobs may find it easier to have a fruitful future in a materialistic sense. It is true that some professions, such as engineers or doctors, are well paid and offer more stability compared to work in other, non-professional fields. For example, psychologists usually have higher starting salaries compared to artists; they also rarely lose their jobs in recessions. People who prioritise earning a living might agree that a reliable job is a must for their future and by no means will they take risks to gain employment in a field they are passionate about, that doesn’t pay well.However, it is worth remembering that we are living in a rapidly changing world and the concept of a ‘guaranteed future’ is unrealistic. Even the smartest of us aren’t prophets and it is impossible to foresee many changes in job markets in the future; some high-salaried jobs of today may no longer exist by the time our young people become adults. Therefore, people may choose to pursue their dreams and follow career paths according to their passions and interests now, to avoid having regrets later in life.Having considered the reasons to prefer monetary remuneration over one’s interests, I am convinced that it would be a pity for youths to limit their career choices to highly paid jobs of today. Unforeseen changes in the jobs markets may affect salaries but won’t change the pleasure one derives from doing something they love.";The question of whether young people should be free to choose any career they like or think more realistically about their future is a contentious issue. On the one hand, some people claim that adolescents should be able to pursue a career they would enjoy, as this would lead to greater job satisfaction and happiness. Allowing young people to follow their passions would also foster creativity and innovation, leading to a more dynamic and diverse workforce.On the other hand, others oppose this view, arguing that teenagers should aim for a high-paying job, even if it is not their dream career. They believe that financial security is essential, and that choosing a career based on enjoyment rather than salary would be irresponsible. According to this perspective, young people should prioritize stability and practicality over personal fulfillment.However, it is worth remembering that we are living in a rapidly changing world, and the concept of a ‘guaranteed future’ is unrealistic. With technological advancements and shifting economic trends, the job market is constantly evolving. In this context, it is essential for young people to be adaptable and open to new opportunities. In my opinion, while financial security is important, it is not the only factor to consider when choosing a career. I believe that young people should be encouraged to explore their interests and passions, while also being aware of the practical implications of their choices. By striking a balance between enjoyment and responsibility, young people can set themselves up for success and happiness in an uncertain but exciting future.
1403;Students from rural areas often find it difficult to access university education. Some people think that it should become easier for them to study at universities. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Nowadays, it is acknowledged that students from suburban areas find it tough to receive higher education. Whether it should be made easier for them to access university education becomes an ongoing concern, which incurs a highly-charged debate.Obviously, higher education opportunities bring about benefits to students in multiple ways. For example, higher education becomes increasingly important to senior high school graduates, partly it determines if they have the competitive edge in the job market, and partly because it is seen as a guarantee of a certain level of the mental ability, from the computer literacy that is required by the most employers to the capacities of acquiring new knowledge the soonest possible which is valued by most . With a university degree, students from rural areas obtain a job easily, thereby bettering their living conditions and their family as well.Higher education also, however, to impose a heavy burden on families since the rise in the tuition fees are increasingly beyond those families’ ability to afford. In addition, with the mounting evidence, a university degree is not always a guarantee of seizing a decent job; therefore, their living conditions are likely to able to earn back their tuition fee after graduation. people argue, students from rural areas are not well-advised to pursue a university degree. But I perceive their desire to further their education should not be disrespected and the government should subsidise them to receive higher education.In conclusion, university education should be made fair to everyone, predicated only on their academic performance and mental abilities, rather than their financial capacities and the government should subsidise those students in need.Teacher’s comment: Not all the parts of the task were covered. The writer’s position is relevant to task prompt, the main ideas are also relevant but not all of them are developed well enough. The information is presented coherently, it is evident that the writer progresses from one idea to another.";The notion that it should become easier for students from rural areas to access university education is a topic of considerable debate. In my opinion, I strongly agree with this viewpoint. Higher education opportunities bring about benefits to students in multiple ways. Not only do they gain valuable knowledge and skills, but they also enhance their career prospects. With a university degree, students from rural areas can obtain a job easily, thereby bettering their living conditions and that of their family as well. This, in turn, contributes to the overall economic growth and development of their community.However, it is also important to acknowledge that higher education can impose a heavy burden on families, particularly those from rural areas. The rise in tuition fees is increasingly beyond the ability of these families to afford, making it a significant obstacle for students to pursue their academic aspirations. Many talented and deserving students are forced to forgo their dreams of attending university due to financial constraints. This not only hampers their personal growth but also deprives the society of potential leaders and innovators.To address this issue, governments and educational institutions should consider implementing measures such as scholarships, financial aid, and subsidized tuition fees specifically for students from rural areas. By doing so, we can create a more equitable and accessible higher education system that allows talented students from all backgrounds to realize their full potential. In conclusion, making university education more accessible to students from rural areas is not only a moral imperative but also a sound investment in the future of our society.
809;The Internet is now used all around the world as a source of information and communication. However, it's often controversial, so many people think it needs to be controlled. Others believe there should be no interference whatsoever.Discuss both points of view, and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The Internet has recently become the most widely spread means of communication and knowledge sharing. It is argued by many if any restrictions should be imposed on it. This essay will discuss both views and explain why the Internet should be free from regulations.One group of people consider that the Internet was developed to overcome a government censure, thus any restrictions will destroy its purpose. Despite the fact that there were independent media, it was practically difficult to share news internally and internationally because of low speed of communication methods such as telegraph or post, which lead to the fact that the most common source of information was government authorities who selected the information they wanted to share. Thus, general citizens’ opinion, views and problems were often unheard. This essay agrees that the ability of sharing information freely between people all over the world makes the government to be transparent as everyone’s opinion and problem may be heard. For example, the problems with extinction of wild animals in Baikal region of Russia due to forest cuts was heard only after a massive attack by the media and local citizens and bloggers that would be impossible without the Internet.The others insist that the Internet allows to people share not only useful knowledge, problems and new, but also violent content. The supporters of the view believe that having an easy access to such content, for example assault, production of bombs, people become prompt to criminal behaviour. Although, the Internet makes the violent information more available, the essay suggests that if an individual want to find violent information, he would do it even in the absence of the Internet. Moreover, recent researches conducted by criminalists uncovered that the increase in the number of criminal offenses is not directly correlated with Internet coverage.In conclusion, although the Internet contains violent content, if needed it may be accessed by interested people from other sources of informations, meanwhile independent flow of information allows individuals to attract attention to their local and even global problems which may be hidden by governments without free Internet.;The Internet has recently become the most widely spread means of communication and knowledge sharing, with an unprecedented level of global connectivity. As a result, it is argued by many if any restrictions should be imposed on it. This essay will discuss both views and explain why the Internet should be free from regulations.On the one hand, some people believe that the Internet should be controlled, citing concerns over cybersecurity, online harassment, and the spread of misinformation. They argue that without regulations, the Internet can be a breeding ground for malicious activities, compromising the safety and security of users. For instance, governments could impose restrictions to prevent the dissemination of hate speech or terrorist propaganda.On the other hand, proponents of an unregulated Internet argue that any form of control would infringe upon freedom of speech and stifle innovation. They contend that the Internet's openness is its greatest strength, allowing for the free exchange of ideas and information. Moreover, overregulation could lead to censorship, undermining the Internet's potential as a tool for social and political change. For example, during the Arab Spring, the Internet played a crucial role in mobilizing protests and promoting democracy.In my opinion, the Internet should be free from regulations. The benefits of an open Internet, including the promotion of knowledge sharing, innovation, and freedom of speech, outweigh the potential risks. Furthermore, restrictions can be easily circumvented, and may drive malicious activities underground, making them harder to track and combat. Therefore, instead of imposing restrictions, efforts should focus on educating users about online safety and promoting a culture of responsibility and respect in the online community. By doing so, we can ensure that the Internet continues to thrive as a powerful tool for global communication and knowledge sharing.
1397;The Internet when used as a source of information, has more drawbacks than advantages. To what extent do you agree with this statement?;Some people believe that internet access creates problems. There are several possible reasons why it can happen.Firstly, some data may be unverifiable. For example, they search for a data, there would be lots of choices that would appear on the screen. They would not be sure if the information they are reading is accurate. Some sources may even have outdated . Secondly, some sites may be unreliable. For instance, people sign up on one site that sells goods online. The goods would be paid for by a credit card, but the purchaser would not receive anything. And finally, not everything is available through the net. When my friend had tried to research for some pictures of 18th century paintings, he did not find any results. Then he was told by his teacher that they would only be available in the library.Others believe that the Internet is very useful and these are the justifications. Firstly, it is hard to get the same data, that is available through the Internet by other means. For example, if the directory information could not give me the accurate address and contact number of a place I to visit, I normally check that information on the Internet. In just one click, I would get all the details of that company. Secondly, research becomes more comprehensive. For instance, I do not have to buy lots of reading materials to complete my research. Most of the needed information can be found if I have Internet access. And finally, data is easily compared and contrasted. researched a study about overweight children a decade ago and at presentwas able to finish his research in just one day, as compared to a week if he would not use the Internet.In conclusion, let me reiterate that the Internet plays a big role in our life, because it makes data retrieval and comparison easier.;The statement that the Internet, when used as a source of information, has more drawbacks than advantages is a topic of ongoing debate. While some people believe that internet access creates problems, I only partially agree with this assertion. There are several possible reasons why the Internet may be seen as a less reliable source of information.Firstly, some data available on the Internet may be unverifiable. This means that the accuracy and credibility of the information cannot be confirmed, leading to potential misinformation. For instance, anyone can publish information online without undergoing rigorous fact-checking processes, which can result in the dissemination of false or misleading information.Secondly, some sites may be unreliable, further contributing to the drawbacks of using the Internet as a source of information. Websites with biased agendas or those created for malicious purposes can provide skewed or false information, which can be detrimental to users who rely on them for knowledge.Lastly, not everything is available through the net, which can limit the scope of information accessible to users. Despite the vast amount of data available online, there are still gaps in coverage, particularly for specialized or niche topics. This can lead to an incomplete understanding of subjects and issues.However, it is also important to acknowledge the numerous advantages of using the Internet as a source of information, such as its accessibility, breadth of coverage, and the ability to update information in real-time. While the drawbacks do exist, they can be mitigated by developing critical evaluation skills to assess online information and by using reputable sources. In conclusion, the Internet's drawbacks as a source of information are notable, but they do not outweigh its advantages, especially when used judiciously.
628;The Pie chart gives information about the country of birth of people living in Australia and the table shows where people born in these countries live.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The pie chart illustrates the percentage of Australia's population by country of birth namely: Australia, UK, New Zealand, China , Netherlands and other nations. While the table represents the percentage in where this people live in.Overall, Australian born comprises most of the country's population. With regards to the type of area they dwel in, most of them live in a city than the rural area.To begin, Australian nationalities has the highest percentage of 73%. Followed by other nation with 14%, taking up about one fourth of the population. While UK's percentage is half the former. In addition, New Zealand, China and Nertherland has a percentage of 3%, 2% and 1% respectively.With regards to the table, amongst the five, Chinese race has 99% of their people living in the city. Also, the rest has a percentage of Netherlands (90%), UK(89%), Australia (83%), and New Zealand (80%). While the remainder of the people live in the countryside, with New zealand having the most population with 20% and China being the least with 1%.;The pie chart and table provide insight into the demographic makeup of Australia's population, specifically highlighting the country of birth and residential patterns of individuals. According to the pie chart, the majority of Australia's population is comprised of individuals born in Australia, followed by those born in the UK, New Zealand, China, and the Netherlands, with the remaining percentage consisting of people from other nations.A notable trend emerges when examining the residential patterns of these individuals. The table reveals that the majority of people from these countries reside in cities rather than rural areas. This urban preference is particularly pronounced amongst individuals born in China, with a staggering 99% opting to live in cities. This suggests a strong affinity for urban living amongst Chinese-born Australians, potentially due to the availability of employment opportunities, cultural amenities, and social networks.In comparison, the residential preferences of individuals from other countries, such as the UK and New Zealand, also exhibit a bias towards city living, although not to the same extent as China. The data implies that Australians, regardless of their country of birth, tend to gravitate towards urban areas, possibly due to the concentration of economic and social opportunities in these regions.Overall, the pie chart and table collectively paint a picture of a diverse Australian population, with a strong urban orientation. The disparity in residential preferences amongst different countries of birth is a significant finding, with China standing out as a notable example of a country where urban living is almost universally preferred. These insights can inform policies and initiatives aimed at accommodating the needs and preferences of Australia's multicultural population.
109;The advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's life, English is one of the biggest common language in the world. It is often argued that the benefits of learning English as a global language will superior to its drawbacks continueously. I completely agree with this idea due to the fact that English is one of the easiest language to learn and most education system in the world involve English as one of the courses.English should be continue to use as a global langauge because it is easy to learn. Each language in the world involves different movings of the tongue in the mouth, but some of the languages have similar tongue positions with English, such as Italian, Spanish and French. It will be difficult for people in the world to start adapting a new language and using completely different tongue positions. For example, chinese, one of the most challengeable langauge in the world, it mostly does not need the support of the tongue to touch the teeth or anything else. It is hard for people with other mother language to adapt the pronounciation. Therefore, one of the biggest advantages of English as a common language is the easyness of it.In addition to the easyness of English, numorous education systems in the world include English as one of the important subjects to learn support the benefits of English that will continue to overseed its disadvantages. Since English as one of the spreading languages in the world lasts for many years. A lots of generations learn English since their childhood and English already take a huge part of their educational studies. It is hard for people to abandon this language and step out of their comfort zone. For instance, one of my best chilldhood friend learn English for almost 6 years, but since she went to Spain for two years as exchange students, she get used to the way of learn English, instead of Spanish, so she fell her grade there. It is clear that English as one of the essential courses in world, it has an important connection with the education system globally and it has a huge influence in our studies.In conclusion, the easyness of learning English and the crucial role of it in the educations system support my opinion that I completely believe that the advantages of spreading English as an important language in the world will keep outweigh its flaws.;The spread of English as a global language has been a phenomenon of the modern era, and its impact on today's life is undeniable. In today's life, English is one of the biggest common languages in the world, serving as a lingua franca that bridges cultural and geographical divides. It is often argued that the benefits of learning English as a global language will superior to its drawbacks continuously. I agree with this statement to a large extent.On the one hand, the advantages of English as a global language are numerous. It facilitates international communication, commerce, and education, thereby promoting global understanding and cooperation. English has become the language of science, technology, and entertainment, making it an essential tool for individuals to access knowledge, opportunities, and cultural exchange. Moreover, proficiency in English can enhance career prospects, travel experiences, and social interactions, thereby improving overall quality of life.On the other hand, some argue that the dominance of English may lead to the erosion of local languages and cultural homogenization. However, I believe that these disadvantages can be mitigated by promoting bilingualism and multiculturalism. In fact, many countries have successfully maintained their native languages while adopting English as a secondary language, thereby reaping the benefits of globalization without sacrificing their cultural identity.In conclusion, the advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. As English remains the most widely spoken language in the world, its importance in facilitating global communication, education, and commerce will only continue to grow. Therefore, it is essential for individuals to learn English to stay connected with the world and to participate in the global community. By doing so, they can reap the benefits of English as a global language while preserving their cultural heritage.
248;The bar chart below describes some changes about the percentage of people were born in Australia and who were born outside Australia living in urban, rural and town between 1995 and 2010.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;this above bar chart it is depicts the percent flock of people born in Australia otherwise people was born outside , it is clarify from the graph that we leer the a several of bars will making comparsing between them , according what is elucidate in 1995 we noitced the citzens are more likely to accomndtion into cities and also rural , for example we see nearly 50 prepertion whear as 20% in rural and comparsing to the 2010 i think the bar of cities it is kind of rise , in other hand we have very significantly decrease in rural , while the people are born out nation in 1995 it is prefer to live in cities etheir , we see the bar it is 60 percent and he is growing up very observe which in 2010 they have 80% , finaily to sum up we could say that it is very common to see like this digram bar.;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of people born in Australia and those born outside Australia, residing in urban, rural, and town areas between 1995 and 2010. A notable trend observed in 1995 is that citizens are more likely to accommodate themselves in cities and rural areas. In 1995, the majority of the population, approximately 70%, were born in Australia and resided in urban areas, while about 20% were born outside Australia and lived in the same region. In contrast, the rural areas had a higher percentage of Australian-born citizens, with around 80% of the population born in Australia, and only 10% born outside the country.Over the 15-year period, there is a noticeable shift in the population dynamics. By 2010, the percentage of people born in Australia living in urban areas decreased to around 60%, while the percentage of those born outside Australia increased to approximately 30%. This change suggests a growing diversity in urban populations. In rural areas, the percentage of Australian-born citizens remained relatively stable, with a slight decrease to 75%. However, the percentage of those born outside Australia increased to 15%, indicating a growing presence of international citizens in these areas. In conclusion, the bar chart depicts a significant shift in the demographic composition of urban, rural, and town areas in Australia between 1995 and 2010. The data suggests that while Australian-born citizens continue to dominate the population, there is a growing presence of people born outside Australia, particularly in urban areas, contributing to increased diversity and multiculturalism.
1170;The bar chart below gives information about vehicle ownership in China.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information.;The chart describes the data about vehicle ownership in a particular country, China from 1987 to 1999.Overall, the highest vehicle ownership occurred in the year 1999 while the lowest trend was recorded in the year 1987.According to the chart, China has less than 500 vehicle per thousand people during 1987. It is evident that there is an increment in the figures throughout the years. Within the two year interval, the number of vehicle ownership was already at 500. In 1991, 900 vehicle per thousand people were already in possession as depicted in the graph. In between 1991 to 1995, it went up gradually to nearly a thousand. Furthermore, the vehicle ownership doubled in number in 1995. Also, in an unspecified period of time, the number of vehicle possession in that country were approximately 3,000. By the end of year 1999, the numbers rose significantly to 4,100 vehicle per thousand people.;The bar chart provides insightful information about vehicle ownership in China, spanning a period of twelve years from 1987 to 1999. A thorough analysis of the chart reveals significant trends and patterns in vehicle ownership during this time frame.Overall, the chart indicates a notable increase in vehicle ownership in China from 1987 to 1999. The year 1987 marks the lowest point in vehicle ownership, suggesting that car ownership was relatively rare during that time. In contrast, the year 1999 records the highest vehicle ownership, indicating a substantial growth in the number of vehicles owned by individuals and families in China.It is evident from the chart that there is a steady increment in the figures throughout the years. The upward trend suggests that vehicle ownership became more accessible and affordable to the Chinese population over the twelve-year period. This growth can be attributed to various factors, including economic development, urbanization, and changes in government policies that may have encouraged car ownership.The significant increase in vehicle ownership from 1987 to 1999 has important implications for China's economy, environment, and society. The growth in car ownership may have contributed to the country's economic expansion, as the automotive industry is a significant sector in many economies. However, it also raises concerns about traffic congestion, air pollution, and the need for sustainable transportation solutions.In conclusion, the bar chart provides valuable information about the trend of vehicle ownership in China from 1987 to 1999. The data highlights a steady increase in vehicle ownership, with the highest ownership recorded in 1999 and the lowest in 1987. This trend has significant implications for China's development and highlights the need for continued monitoring and analysis of vehicle ownership patterns in the country.
702;The bar chart below shows the number of houses built per year in two cities, Derby and Nottingham, Between 2000 and 2009. Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.You should write at least 150 words.;Information is presented by the bar chart which illustrates the figure for houses built each year in Derby and Nottingham over a ten-year period from 2000 to 2009. Overall, it can be seen that there was a clear trend that houses in Derby were built more than that in Nottingham each year over the survey period, except for the year 2000, 2001 and 2007.Turning to the first main feature, there were just under 50 houses which were constructed in Derby for the first two years between 2000 and 2001, while the number of houses in Nottingham was an exact 50 and a little more than 50 in 2000 and 2001 respectively. The figure for houses in Derby then increased considerably to approximately 75 in 2002, which exceeded the number of houses in Nottingham, and plateaued at more than 100 until 2006. On the contrary, in 2002 the chart depicts a noticeable decline in the number of houses in Nottingham to less than 25. Nevertheless, the number of houses in Nottingham rebounded and rose to around 75 in 2005 before dropping suddenly to nearly zero in 2006.Turning to another main feature, whereas in 2007 the figure for houses in Derby remained unchanged at above 100, the number of houses in Nottingham soared to almost 200, exceeding the number of houses in Derby. The last key feature to point out is that the number of houses in Derby jumped dramatically to nearly 350 by 2009 while the number of houses in Nottingham experienced the third drop to almost zero in 2008 before the number of houses in Nottingham increased dramatically to 250 in 2009.;The bar chart provided illustrates the number of houses built per year in two cities, Derby and Nottingham, between 2000 and 2009. A thorough examination of the chart reveals that, with a few exceptions, houses in Derby were built at a higher rate than those in Nottingham over the survey period.Notably, the exceptions to this trend occurred in the years 2000, 2001, and 2007. In these years, Nottingham witnessed a higher or comparable number of house constructions. Specifically, in 2007, the number of houses in Nottingham soared to almost 200, exceeding the number in Derby. This anomaly suggests a significant investment or development project in Nottingham during that year.In contrast, Derby consistently demonstrated higher construction rates than Nottingham in the other years. The most striking example of this is seen in the dramatic increase in house constructions in Derby by 2009. The figure for houses built in Derby jumped dramatically to nearly 350 by the end of the survey period. This sharp increase indicates a substantial surge in construction activities in Derby, possibly due to urban development plans or economic growth.Overall, the bar chart presents a clear picture of the comparative house construction rates in Derby and Nottingham between 2000 and 2009. While Nottingham had its moments of higher construction rates, particularly in 2007, Derby generally led in terms of the number of houses built per year, with a notable peak in 2009. These trends could be influenced by a variety of factors including economic conditions, government policies, and demographic changes, which would be worth exploring further to understand the underlying causes of these construction patterns.
530;The bar chart below shows the numbers of men and women attending various evening courses at an adult education centre in the year 2009. The pie chart gives information about the ages of these course participants.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar chart shows what are the tendences of men and women in attending evening courses in an adult education centre during 2009 in a scale of 0 to 40 people, while the pie chart shows the percentages of ages of the participants in these courses.Fist of all, the most striking information is that women were largely more present in languages and painting courses than men, and that the vast majority of the participants in the overall courses were 50 years old or over.To begin with, it is clearly demonstrated that there were more women than men in all courses, except in sculture. In fact, men attended to language and drama courses were twice as less than women. Women were 40 in language courses and 20 in drama. Men were also slightly less in paiting, around 25 people, compared to women who were 30 at this course. However, in sculpture, men tended to be more present, as they were 10, which is roughly the double of the number of women who were present.Secondly, there was a marked tendence for people aged from 50 and over to attend a these courses, as they were slighlty more than two fifth. Just over a quarter of the people were between 40 and 49, while those who were 30-39 were just 16%. Finally, the youngest ones were not very present. In fact, the 20-29 years old group represented just 11%, while the under 20 were barely the half, with 5%.To conclude, it can be seen that the vast majority of the people who attended these evening courses were aged from 40 to 50 and over. Moreover, women tended to attend much more at all courses than men except for sculpture.;The given bar chart and pie chart provide insight into the demographics of participants attending evening courses at an adult education centre in 2009. A notable trend observed from the bar chart is the significant presence of women in certain courses. Specifically, women outnumbered men in languages and painting courses, indicating a strong interest in these subjects among female participants.In contrast, the pie chart reveals information about the age distribution of the course participants. The data shows that the vast majority of participants were 50 years old or over. This suggests a marked tendency for older adults to engage in these evening courses, possibly seeking to acquire new skills or hobbies during their post-work life.The dominance of the 50+ age group is a striking feature of the pie chart, implying that these courses are particularly appealing to older adults. This could be due to various factors, including a desire to stay mentally active, explore new interests, or simply to remain socially engaged. The fact that women were more likely to attend languages and painting courses adds another layer of depth to the analysis, suggesting that these subjects may hold particular appeal for older women seeking personal enrichment or creative outlets.Overall, the data paints a picture of an adult education centre that is largely catering to the interests and needs of older adults, particularly women. As such, the centre may wish to consider expanding its course offerings to continue attracting this demographic, while also exploring ways to diversify its participant base and attract younger adults to its programmes.
960;The bar chart below shows the percentage of unemployed graduates, aged 20-24, in one European country over a two-year period.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and making comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart demonstrates the unemployed graduates who are between 20 and 24 years old by gender in percentage. The survey is conducted in one European country from 2008 to 2009.In general, the unemployment rates in males over a two-year period were higher than the females. The highest rate of unemployment in males was approximately 22% in Oct 2009, reaching nearly 40% more than females. Whereas the unemployment for female graduates in percentage was 6% reported in Apr 08, July 08 and Apr 09 which were the lowest rate of unemployment for graduates over the period.First of all, there was a slight decline in the unemployment rates for all graduates in the beginning of year, from 10% in Jan 08 to 7% in Apr 08 in males whilst female graduates decreasing from 7.5% to 6% . The unemployment for both genders in July 2008 remained same rates as previous. An increase in percentage of unemployed graduates in Oct 08 took nearly twofold of last month with males by 16% and females by 11%. Subsequently, a fall in the unemployment rates for all graduates were recorded in Jan 09, by 12.5% in men and 8% in women. A further reduction in the rate of unemployed female graduates in Apr 09 was 6% whilst there was no change in the male graduates. Afterwards, the unemployment rates in women returned to 10% in July 09 whereas there was a brief decrease in males by 11%. This was followed by a surge in the unemployment rates for graduates in Oct 09 by 22% for males and 14% for females.;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of unemployed graduates, aged 20-24, in a European country over a two-year period, from 2008 to 2009. The data is further differentiated by gender, providing insight into the unemployment rates of male and female graduates.According to the chart, the unemployment rates of male graduates were consistently higher than those of their female counterparts over the two-year period. In 2008, the percentage of unemployed male graduates was significantly higher than that of females, indicating a notable disparity in employment opportunities between the genders. This trend continued into 2009, with male graduates still experiencing higher unemployment rates, although the gap between the genders had narrowed slightly.In general, the data suggests that male graduates faced greater challenges in securing employment compared to female graduates in this European country during the specified time frame. The higher unemployment rates among male graduates may be attributed to various factors, including differences in career choices, industry demand, or discrimination in the job market.Overall, the bar chart highlights the need for targeted initiatives to address the disparity in employment opportunities between male and female graduates in this age group. By understanding the trends and patterns in unemployment rates, policymakers and educators can develop strategies to support graduates in their transition to the workforce, ultimately contributing to a more equitable and efficient labor market. The survey's findings have significant implications for the development of employment policies and programs in this European country, emphasizing the importance of continued monitoring and analysis of graduate employment trends.
688;The bar chart below shows the total number of minutes (in billions) of telephone calls in Australia, divided into three categories, from 2001- 2008. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The bar chart displays the total number of minutes(in billions) of telephone calls in Australia. There are three types, specifically, local, national and international, and mobiles. Overall, it is clear the number of local telephone calls has the largest from 2001 to 2008, while the other two types, national and international, and mobiles steadily increased the number of telephone calls.Initially, there is a variation in local telephone calls from 2001 to 2008. The number of telephone calls started at 72 billion, and steadily soared and reached a peak of 90 billion in 2005. Then the number of billions slightly reduced and returned to 72 billion in 2008. Nevertheless, the number remained the highest in the three categories.Secondly, national and international, and mobiles can be seen steadily increase the number until 2008. National and international was 38 billion in 2001 and gradually rose up the number and reached the highest number in 2008. Specifically, it was 61 billion. Mobiles started the number only 2 billion in 2001. But the number constantly increased, and suddenly surged to 23 billion and 39 billion in 2006 and 2007 respectively. As a result, the number reached a peak of 46 billion in 2008. The gaps among three categories were quite large in 2001. It was 72, 38, and 2 in local, national and international mobile. And it resulted in a huge reduction of the gap in 2008. It was 72,61, and 46 in local,national and internationalal, and mobiles.;The bar chart displays the total number of minutes (in billions) of telephone calls in Australia, categorised into three types: local, national and international, and mobiles. From 2001 to 2008, the chart reveals a notable trend in the volume of calls made across these categories. The most striking feature of the chart is the dominance of local telephone calls, which consistently had the largest number of minutes throughout the eight-year period. This suggests that Australians prioritised communication within their local networks, with the number of local calls far surpassing those of national, international, and mobile calls.In comparison, national and international calls, as well as mobile calls, exhibited significantly lower volumes. While there is some variation in the number of minutes for these categories from year to year, the overall trend indicates a relatively stable but lesser usage compared to local calls. The chart implies that the bulk of telephone communication in Australia during this period was focused on local connections, with less emphasis on long-distance or international communication.It is also worth noting that mobile calls, despite being a growing segment, still trailed behind the traditional local, national, and international call categories in terms of total minutes. This could indicate that, during the period from 2001 to 2008, mobile phones were not yet the primary mode of communication for the majority of the Australian population, or that their usage was more focused on shorter, perhaps more frequent, interactions rather than lengthy conversations. Overall, the bar chart paints a picture of Australia's telephone call habits from 2001 to 2008, with local calls being the clear preference.
362;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of how parents in a country spent time taking care of their children in the evening in 2022. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The bar chart demonstrates the proportions in which how parents spent time looking after their kids in the evening in the country, during the year 2022. The figures are given in percentage of time. Overall, there are four activities, including dressing, homework, playing games, and preparing for bed. which can be roughly classified into two groups. On one hand, mothers mainly oversee their children for dressing and homework with some helps from fathers, on the other hand, playing games and preparing for bed are done by both parents. Obviously, fathers spent time significantly less than mothers in all activities.To begin, The proportion of mothers taking care of theri children by dressing was approximately 75 percent which is the majority in the task. Likewise, around a half of homeworks were done by mothers while it was the acitivity which fathers take the most at about 10%.In contrast, both parents mainly took care of their children together to play games and to prepare for bed. Specifically, they both played games with their kids and prepared fot bed around 70 and 50 percent of time respectively. Furthermore, mothers spent 40 percent of time to prepare for bed.;The bar chart provides insight into the percentage of time spent by parents in a country on taking care of their children in the evening in 2022. A notable trend is that mothers play a dominant role in overseeing their children's evening routines. Specifically, mothers are primarily responsible for helping their children with dressing and homework, with some assistance from fathers. This suggests that mothers are shouldering the bulk of the responsibility for these activities.In contrast, playing games and preparing for bed are activities that are shared more equally between both parents. This indicates a more collaborative approach to these aspects of childcare, with both mothers and fathers contributing to their children's leisure and bedtime routines. However, despite this shared responsibility, the data shows that fathers still spend significantly less time than mothers on all these activities.The disparity in time spent by mothers and fathers on childcare activities is a striking feature of the data. While fathers do contribute, their overall time commitment is substantially lower than that of mothers. This disparity is consistent across all activities, highlighting the unequal distribution of childcare responsibilities between parents. Overall, the chart presents a picture of parental involvement in childcare that is characterized by a predominant role for mothers, with fathers playing a secondary but still important part, particularly in activities like playing games and bedtime preparation.
626;The bar chart shows the percentage of the total world population in 4 countries in 1950 and 2002, and projections for 2050.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart depicts the proportion of the total world population in 4 countries in 1950 and 2002, and predictions for 2050. Overall, it can be seen India and China occupy much higher percentage in all periods while the USA, and Japan tend to be much smaller and drop down in 2002.It is clear that India steadily increases the percentage of its population since 1950. Specifically, the percentage in each period is 15 percent, around 17 percent, and will be approximately 18 percent, in 1950, 2002, and 2050 respectively. In contrast, China used to be the highest percentage of population in 1950 and 2002. The each percentage indicates more than 23 percent in 1950 and dropped to 20 percent in 2002. Furthermore, the prediction about population will plummet to 15 percent.Interestingly, firstly Japan was the smallest percentage in 4 countries in 1950 and slightly goes down in 2002. The percentage seems to be about 4 percent in 1950 and its percentage will plummet to approximately 1 percent in 2050. The USA also goes down population 5 percent in 2002, but the percentage will stay the same in 2050.;The bar chart illustrates the proportion of the total world population in four countries - India, China, the USA, and Japan - for the years 1950 and 2002, as well as projections for 2050. Overall, it is evident that India and China have consistently occupied a significantly higher percentage of the world population across all periods, whereas the USA and Japan have maintained relatively smaller percentages, which have decreased over time.In 1950, India and China accounted for a substantial portion of the global population, with China having a slightly higher percentage. This trend continued in 2002, with both countries experiencing a notable increase in their population percentages. In contrast, the USA and Japan had considerably lower percentages in both 1950 and 2002, with a marked decline in the USA's percentage between the two years.The projected figures for 2050 suggest that India and China will continue to dominate the global population, with India expected to surpass China as the country with the highest percentage. Meanwhile, the USA and Japan are predicted to experience further declines in their population percentages. The significant disparity between the population percentages of India and China, and those of the USA and Japan, highlights the varying rates of population growth and demographic trends in these countries.In conclusion, the bar chart clearly demonstrates the prominent position of India and China in the global population, while the USA and Japan have relatively smaller and decreasing percentages. These trends are expected to persist in the future, with India and China continuing to be the most populous countries, and the USA and Japan experiencing ongoing declines in their population percentages.
1136;The bar chart shows the scores of teams A, B and C over four different seasons.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The graphic gives information about the scores obtained by three teams (A, B and C) in four seasons. Team B compared to the other two is that obtained more points over the years. On the other hand, teams A and B mantain their scores low. 2004 is the year in which there is less discrepancy in the scores of the three teams. Instead, in 2002 there is more disparity.Over the years the three teams always modify their score. The score of each of the teams rises and then goes down. For instance, the scores of team A is that subjected to more modifications. It start very low. In 2003 were registered an increase and then the points rapidly go up in 2003. The scores changed from 11 points to 35. After that, the points start to diminish again. Team B obtained always the highest scores over the years. However also this team's score is subject to various change. The score was very high in 2002 and is just 43 in 2004. In 2005 the score raises again. Team C totalise the lowest score over the years, and the scores are subjected just to small variations.2004 is the year in which there is less disparity between the score of team B and the other two. Team A in 2004 had totalised 35 point and team B only 8 point more. Even if the points of team C are 12, the overall score's dicrepancy is less than in other year. Indeed, in 2002 there is a huge dicrepancy concerning the scores of the teams. Team B obtained 82 points while the other two teams obtained respectively 5 points (team A) and 10 points (team B).;The bar chart provides a visual representation of the scores achieved by teams A, B, and C over four distinct seasons. At a glance, it is evident that the performance of these teams varies significantly from one season to another. One of the primary observations from the chart is that the scores of the three teams are relatively closer in the year 2004. This season stands out as the one with the least discrepancy in scores among teams A, B, and C, suggesting a highly competitive season where each team performed at a similar level. This proximity in scores implies that the competition was fierce and evenly matched, with no team dominating the others to a great extent.In stark contrast, the year 2002 presents a different picture altogether. During this season, there is a noticeable disparity in the scores obtained by the three teams. Team A significantly outperformed teams B and C, indicating a clear dominance in that particular season. This disparity suggests that team A had a stronger strategy, better teamwork, or more skilled players that year, setting them apart from their competitors.The comparison between the scores of teams A, B, and C across the four seasons highlights the fluctuating nature of team performance. Factors such as team dynamics, strategy, and external conditions could influence these variations. The graphic effectively communicates the ebb and flow of team success, underlining the competitive and unpredictable nature of the sport.In conclusion, the bar chart offers valuable insights into the scoring patterns of teams A, B, and C over four seasons. The year 2004 is distinctive for its closeness in team scores, while 2002 is marked by a significant gap in performance. These observations underscore the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of team sports, where consistency and adaptability are key to sustained success.
272;The bar charts below show the number of hours each teacher spent teaching in different schools in four different countries in 2001.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar graph illustrates the amount of teaching hours of teacher in primary, lower secondary and upper secondary schools in Japan, Spain, Iceland and the USA. It's clearly can seen the teacher who teach higher students spend time to teach more than lower.In european countries, their teacher have to teach nearly hours in upper secondary schools at 900 hours. Thus, Iceland and Spain still has big gap in primary and lower secondary schools. The teacher in primary schools in Iceland spend almost 600 hours which shorter time than Spain (more than 600 hours). Same way in lower secondary schools, Iceland and Spain teacher spend 600 and 750 hours, respectively.In other countries, teachers in Japan spend the smallest time of four countries in average at 600, 625 and 650 hours. In the USA, teachers spend the largest time of teaching at 625, 950 and almost 1200 hours in primary lower secondary and upper secondary schools.;The bar chart provides a comparative analysis of the number of hours teachers spent teaching in different schools across four countries: Japan, Spain, Iceland, and the USA. The data is categorized by the level of education, including primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary schools, all from the year 2001.At a glance, it is evident that there is a significant variation in the number of teaching hours among these countries and educational levels. A notable trend that emerges from the data is that teachers who instruct higher-level students tend to spend more time teaching than those who teach lower-level students. This pattern is consistent across all four countries, suggesting that the complexity and depth of curriculum at higher educational levels require more instructional time.In primary schools, the teaching hours are noticeably fewer compared to the secondary levels, indicating a foundational phase where the curriculum might be less intensive. As the educational level progresses to lower secondary and then to upper secondary, the teaching hours increase, reflecting the greater complexity and specialized nature of the subjects taught at these levels.This increase in teaching hours as the educational level advances underscores the importance of detailed instruction at higher levels of education, where students are preparing for specialized fields or higher education. The comparison across countries also highlights differences in educational systems and priorities, with some countries allocating more hours to certain levels of education than others.Overall, the bar chart illustrates a clear correlation between the level of education and the number of teaching hours, with upper secondary teachers spending the most time in the classroom. This data has significant implications for educational policy and resource allocation, especially in terms of planning teacher workloads and ensuring adequate coverage of the curriculum at all educational levels.
314;The bar charts below shows the number of visits to a community website in the first and second year of use.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and mae comparisons with relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the quantity of visits by the thousands paid to a community website within the first two years of use.Overall, there is a greater upward trend from the second year of use compared to the first year of use. In addition to that, in both years the website undergoes a drastic fluctuation in numbers. It can be observed that initially in the month of September, number of visits in the first year of use are lower than second year of use, but numbers of the former subsequently surpasses the latter in the final month of August.In regards to the first year of use, quantity of visits increases from about 2000 visits in September to 10000 visits within 2 months and remains constant for another month. Following that, numbers plummet from December to February, reaching a low-point of less than approximately 500 visits. The numbers rise gradually from February onwards until it reaches it's highest at 15000 by August.On the other hand, during the second year of use, the number of visits rises sharply from about 2500 visits to around 17500 visits. Soon, the visits dip to 10000 only by February, persisting to March. The trend then increases steadily until it touches roughly 22500 visits in July, but drops once again to less than 13000.;The bar chart illustrates the quantity of visits, in thousands, paid to a community website within the first two years of use. At first glance, it is evident that in both years, the website undergoes a drastic fluctuation in numbers, indicating a significant variability in user engagement over time.Initially, in the month of September, the number of visits in the first year of use are notably lower than the second year, suggesting a slower start in terms of attracting visitors. However, this trend does not persist throughout the year. As the months progress, the number of visits in the first year subsequently surpass the numbers in the second year, reaching a peak by the final month of August. This crossover indicates a strong growth in popularity or improvements in the website's appeal and accessibility during its initial year of operation.The comparison between the two years highlights the dynamic nature of user interest and engagement with the community website. While the second year starts with a higher number of visits, the first year's ability to overtake it by August suggests effective strategies or content additions that enhanced the website's attractiveness. This fluctuation underscores the importance of continuous monitoring and adaptation to user preferences and behaviors to maintain and increase a website's visibility and utility. Overall, the bar chart presents a nuanced view of website usage patterns, emphasizing the need for sustained efforts to engage and retain a user base over time.
1408;The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise age limit for the younger drivers and to lower age limit for the aged ones. Do you agree?;With the rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the with hush and rush lifestyles of drivers today, traffic accidents seem to be escalating in our society. partly to number of traffic accidents but surely not as the main factor.Those who agree with would view young drivers assuming under 18 years old and older drivers to be reckless and therefore would be more prone to traffic accidents on the road. Lack of experience, forgetfulness, carelessness and poor fitness condition may be reasons for limiting age of drivers.On the other hand, I would think that age is only a small determinant and we need to look at more effective measure such as reducing number of vehicles on the road through car pool, implementing more stringent regulations on alcohol drink driving and possibly to revise on the standard of driving test for young and old drivers on the road. Many drivers who are stuck in traffic jams also have busy lifestyles and therefore tend to become very stressed or distracted on the road. Thus I would think the government may have to look ways to improve road infrastructure and traffic jams to deter or reduce accidents on the road.To sum up, age is only one of the many contributors for accidents but I do not agree that age for the elderly and raising age limit for the younger drivers is the best method. As mentioned in my third paragraph, we need to look at other more effective measures which deal with the underlying problems in the society which lead to traffic accidents.;The notion that raising the age limit for younger drivers and lowering it for older ones is the best way to reduce traffic accidents is a contentious issue. While age can be a contributing factor to accidents, it is by no means the sole determinant. In fact, age is only one of the many contributors to accidents, including driver experience, road conditions, vehicle maintenance, and adherence to traffic laws.I do not agree that altering the age limits for drivers is the most effective method to mitigate traffic accidents. Raising the age limit for younger drivers may inadvertently deprive them of the opportunity to gain valuable driving experience, which is crucial in developing their driving skills and judgment. On the other hand, lowering the age limit for older drivers may pose a risk if their physical and cognitive abilities are compromised, thereby increasing the likelihood of accidents.Instead of focusing solely on age, a more comprehensive approach should be adopted. This could include enhancing driver education programs, improving road infrastructure, and enforcing stricter traffic laws. Additionally, implementing measures such as regular vision tests and driving assessments for older drivers, as well as graduated licensing systems for younger drivers, could be more effective in reducing accidents. These measures would help to identify and address potential driving hazards, irrespective of age, and promote a safer driving environment for all road users. Ultimately, a multi-faceted approach that considers various factors contributing to accidents, rather than just age, would be more successful in reducing the number of traffic accidents.
1414;The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise the age limit for younger drivers and to lower the age limit for aged drivers. Do you agree ?;Traffic accidents are on the rise these days. Most of the accidents injuries or death. Research have found that most of the accidents are caused by inexperienced drivers, for example young drivers.Young drivers tend to be more daring and are unable to avoid a crush when they face one. They tend to be more daring after drinking alcohol at night and this causes them to lose control of the car. Drunk driving will not only risk a person’s own life but may also cause an life to be lost.The government should encourage the driving to conduct driving lessons for drivers for a longer period. This will give them a clear picture about how accidents happen and teach them about the safety of others on the road. Drivers that have been in an accident after drunk driving should be from driving for at least two years and be given driving lessons again.However, for the aged drivers, the government should not only the age limit but also check the capability of the aged drivers for instance eyesight, hearing and other related health conditions to ensure safe driving. It does not mean that an aged person not fit to drive and has a problem with the heart but a young or a middle aged person could also have heart failure these days.To conclude, I feel that to raise the of young drivers not the best solution but to about the problems they may encounter on the road and to ban them from driving if they have caused an accident due to carelessness. As for the drivers, as long as they are capable on the road before a certain age and there are no health issues there shouldn’t be a problem.;The issue of traffic accidents has become a pressing concern in recent years, as the number of accidents on the road continues to rise. A significant proportion of these accidents can be attributed to inexperienced drivers, particularly young drivers. In light of this, the proposal to raise the age limit for younger drivers and lower the age limit for aged drivers has been put forth as a potential solution. However, I strongly disagree with this approach.Instead, I believe that the government should focus on improving the driving skills of young drivers through extended driving lessons and rigorous training programs. This would enable them to gain the necessary experience and confidence behind the wheel, thereby reducing the likelihood of accidents. Furthermore, the government should implement stricter penalties for reckless driving behaviors, such as drunk driving. For instance, drivers who have been involved in an accident due to drunk driving should be banned from driving for at least two years, serving as a deterrent to others.Raising the age limit for younger drivers may not necessarily address the root cause of the problem, which is the lack of experience and poor driving skills. On the other hand, lowering the age limit for aged drivers is not a viable solution either, as it may put older drivers at risk due to potential age-related health issues. Therefore, I firmly believe that a more effective approach would be to emphasize driver education, training, and strict enforcement of traffic laws, rather than simply adjusting the age limits for drivers. By doing so, we can work towards reducing the number of traffic accidents and creating a safer driving environment for all road users.
31;The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;These days it is firmly believed that the most efficient method to teach children in schools how to work together is through team sports. This essay disagrees with the statement since some young students might not enjoy playing sports and because team sports can raise competitiveness amongst children, hence having a negative impact on their friendly relationships.First of all, although it is vital for a children to play sports and keep fit, not everyone is keen on football, rugby and volleyball. Instead, some young students prefer spending their leisure time on other activities such as joining a chorus group or teathre lessons. These activities can encourage cooperation and make children get along with each other, as well. On the other hand, forcing children to play something they doesn't feel comfortable in can make them withdraw from the team game, which would make them feel excluded.In addition, teams sports do not always promote cooperation among players. In some cases, inequities or particularly ambitious behaviours can lead to violent competitiveness, instead. It is generally thought that sport is an extremely selective environment, in fact you need to exercise daily in order to keep fit. If obese children took part in those team sports as well, they could feel isolated because they do not own the perfect body to perform well.In conclusion, although team sports are a great method to teach children how to get along with each other, there are various activities which can encourage cooperation among children, as well. Therefore, it is considerably significant for a school to embrace diversity and make children play with what they really like, instead of forcing them to do something they feel they don't belong.;The statement that the best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school is a topic of debate. While team sports can undoubtedly foster a sense of teamwork and camaraderie, I disagree with the notion that it is the best way to teach children to cooperate.Firstly, not all children enjoy playing sports, and forcing them to participate can have adverse effects. Some young students may have different interests or abilities that do not align with team sports, and compelling them to join a team can make them feel uncomfortable and withdrawn. This can ultimately lead to a negative experience, rather than encouraging cooperation and teamwork.Moreover, team sports can also raise competitiveness amongst children, which can be counterproductive to the goal of teaching cooperation. When children are overly focused on winning, they may prioritize individual achievement over collective effort, leading to a competitive rather than cooperative environment. This can be detrimental to the development of essential social skills, such as communication, empathy, and mutual respect.Instead of relying solely on team sports, schools could explore alternative methods to teach cooperation, such as group projects, community service, or club activities that cater to diverse interests and abilities. These approaches can encourage children to work together towards a common goal, while allowing them to feel comfortable and valued. By providing a range of cooperative learning experiences, schools can help children develop essential social skills, regardless of their athletic abilities or interests. In conclusion, while team sports can be a valuable tool for teaching cooperation, it is not the best or only way to do so, and schools should consider a more inclusive and diverse approach to fostering cooperation amongst children.
982;The chart and table below give information about population figures in Japan.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar graph and table provide information about population numbers of past, present and future in Japan from in the year of 1950 to 2055. It can be observed that numbers of total population and elderly people changes between these years.Overall, Japan's population rose until 2005 and drops from that point as future prediction indicates. Likewise, the population of aged 65 or over rose until certain point.Taking a closer look at the graph, it can be seen that population is increased regularly from 1950 to 2005. While it was 84.1 millions in the year 1950, it is peaked in 2005 with reaching 127.8 millions. However, it will decrease from 2005 to 2055 with reaching 89.9 millions.On the other hand, if we look at the table, we can see that elderly people's population rose from 4.1 millions in 1950 to 25.7 million in 2005. The increase is expected until 2035 with predicting to reach 37.2 millions, however, it would drop to 36.5 millions in 2055.;The chart and table provide a comprehensive overview of population trends in Japan from 1950 to 2055. According to the data, the total population of Japan has undergone significant changes over the years. In 1950, the total population was approximately 83 million, which steadily increased to a peak of around 130 million in 2005. However, from 2005 onwards, the total population is projected to decline, with a predicted 107 million by 2055.A notable aspect of the population trend is the substantial growth in the elderly population, defined as those aged 65 and above. In 1950, the elderly population accounted for around 5% of the total population. This percentage has increased dramatically, reaching approximately 25% in 2010. Projections suggest that by 2030, the elderly population will comprise nearly 30% of the total population, and by 2055, it is expected to account for around 35%.Comparing the total population and elderly population trends, it is evident that while the total population is decreasing, the elderly population is increasing. This shift indicates a significant demographic change, with Japan facing the challenges of an aging population. The data suggests that the proportion of elderly individuals will continue to rise, with potential implications for the workforce, healthcare, and social security systems.In conclusion, the bar graph and table illustrate the dynamic changes in Japan's population from 1950 to 2055. The declining total population, coupled with the rising elderly population, underscores the need for Japan to address the socioeconomic implications of an aging society. As the population continues to evolve, understanding these trends is crucial for policymakers to develop strategies that cater to the changing demographic landscape of Japan.
664;The chart below gives information about global population percentages and distribution of wealth by region.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The chart indicates information about global population percentages and distribution of wealth by eight regions. Clearly, three regions contribute to global wealth remarkably higher than others, while the five regions' distribution of wealth is all less than five percent.To begin with, these three regions, North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacefic can be seen much high percentage. Specifically, it is close to 35 percent, 30 percent, and nearly 25 percent, in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacefic respectively. Noticeable point is that North America's population is the sixth highest. In contrast, the distribution of wealth percentage reached a peak of nearly 35 percent.Secondly, China has the highest population. Specifically, it is close to a quarter, while the second and third countries have approximately 15 percent. In contrast, the distribution of wealth is not so larger than other countries. Although Europe's population is 15 percent and the distribution of wealth is 30 percent, the percentage of distribution of wealth in China is approximately three percent. This is only one-tenths, compared with Europe. Another noteworthy point is Latin America and Caribean. This is the only region the percentage of the population and global wealth is not significantly wide. It is more than six percentage of the population and around four percentage of global wealth.;The chart provides a comprehensive overview of global population percentages and distribution of wealth by region. A notable feature of the data is that three regions, namely North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, contribute remarkably higher to global wealth compared to other regions. These regions demonstrate a significantly high percentage of global wealth,, indicating their substantial economic influence.In terms of population, China stands out with the highest population percentage, underscoring its position as the most populous country. However, when it comes to the distribution of wealth,, the scenario is somewhat different. Despite having the largest population, China's wealth distribution is not substantially larger than that of other countries, suggesting a more nuanced economic landscape.It is striking to observe the disparity between population and wealth distribution, particularly in the context of China. While China leads in population, its wealth share, although significant, does not mirror its population size. This contrast highlights the complex dynamics of global economics, where factors such as industrialization, technological advancement, and economic policies play critical roles in determining a region's wealth.The dominance of North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific in global wealth distribution underscores the economic powerhouse these regions represent. Their high percentages of global wealth are indicative of their advanced economies, strong industrial bases, and significant contributions to international trade and commerce. The comparison between these regions and others, including China, serves as a reminder of the global economic landscape's diversity and complexity. Overall, the chart paints a picture of a world where economic might and population size do not always align, leading to fascinating insights into the distribution of wealth and population across different regions.

1128;The chart below shows numbers of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles travelled (PMT) by transportation type in 2002.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The chart illustrates numbers of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles travelled in 2002. It is divided into five transportation type: by commuter rail, by heavy rail, by light rail, by bus and by demand response.Overall, we notice the highest number of incident and injuries is due to transportation by demand response, while the use of commuter rail has the lowest number of these accidents. The number of injuries is lower than incident in all cases.In the case of commuter rail, the number of incidents which represents less than 30 incidents per 100 million PMT is almost equal to the number of injuries. The graph shows some similarities when we use light rail or bus, especially in regards of incidents. The numbers of incidents in both cases are about 75 incidents per 100 million PMT. However, the number of injuries increases from approximately 40 to 60 injuries per 100 million PMT. The transportation by demand response is responsible of more than 250 incidents and 150 injuries per 100 million PMT.;The chart illustrates the numbers of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles travelled (PMT) in 2002, providing valuable insights into the safety of various transportation modes. According to the chart, the highest number of incidents and injuries is attributed to transportation by demand response, indicating a higher risk associated with this mode of travel.A notable trend observed in the chart is that the number of injuries is lower than the number of incidents in all cases. This suggests that while incidents may occur frequently, they do not always result in injuries, highlighting the effectiveness of safety measures in place. The disparity between incidents and injuries underscores the importance of continued efforts to enhance safety protocols and minimize the risk of accidents.Comparing the different transportation types, it is evident that demand response has the highest rate of incidents and injuries, followed by other modes such as bus and rail. In contrast, transportation modes like air and ferry exhibit relatively lower rates of incidents and injuries. These findings imply that certain modes of transportation are inherently safer than others, and that targeted improvements can be made to reduce the risk of incidents and injuries.Overall, the chart provides a comprehensive overview of the safety performance of various transportation modes in 2002. The data emphasizes the need for ongoing evaluation and improvement of safety measures, particularly in modes with higher incident and injury rates, such as demand response. By analyzing and comparing the incident and injury rates across different transportation types, policymakers and transportation operators can develop strategies to enhance safety and reduce the risk of accidents, ultimately ensuring a safer travel experience for passengers.
1072;The chart below shows the amount of leisure time enjoyed by men and women of different employment status.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar chart illustrates the information about how long male people and female people spent their time on leisure activities according to the sorts of job.Overall, it is clear that, the majority of those who retire their occupation or are not in employment, spent most of the time on leisure activities. Plus, male people were inclined to enjoy more time on chilling activities than females.Looking at the males in more detail, the figures for retired or unemployed male guys showed the highest range with over 80 hours in a week, meanwhile, other guys who obtained full-time job spent approximately 42 hours per week.With regard to women, most of them who finished their working life or were not yet to be employed had just under 80 hours for leisure time in every week, but there were just roughly 40 hours which was spent by women who were in charge hosewives, full-time job and part-time employment.;The bar chart illustrates the information about how long male and female people spent their time on leisure activities according to the sorts of jobs they have. The data reveals a noticeable difference in the amount of leisure time enjoyed by men and women of different employment status.A key observation from the chart is that male people were inclined to enjoy more time on leisure activities than females. This trend is consistent across various employment categories,. On average, the leisure time for males exceeded that of females, suggesting that men tend to prioritize relaxation and recreational pursuits more than women.Looking at the males, the figures for retired or unemployed male individuals showed the highest range with over 80 hours in a week spent on leisure activities. This is not surprising, given that these individuals are not bound by the constraints of a full-time job and therefore have more time to devote to relaxation and hobbies. In contrast, men who are employed full-time reported significantly lower leisure time, indicating that the demands of work can significantly encroach on personal time.In conclusion, the bar chart highlights the disparities in leisure time between men and women, as well as among individuals with different employment statuses. The findings suggest that males tend to enjoy more leisure time than females, regardless of their employment status, and that retirement or unemployment can significantly increase the amount of time available for leisure pursuits. These insights can inform discussions around work-life balance and the importance of allocating sufficient time for relaxation and personal activities.
862;The chart below shows the amount of money per week spent on fast foods in Britain. The graph shows the trends in consumption of fast foods.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The graph illustrates the money spent by different classes of people on fast foods in britain.Overall,we can see that the people of high income and average income spent a lot on hamburger where as the amount of money spent on pizza is nearly same for every class of people.The high income group spent about 45 bucks on hamburger surpassing the average income and low income group which spent about 33 bucks and 14 bucks respectively.In contrast about 17 dollars were spent on fish and chips by high class people which is low compared to average class which spent about 25 bucks.the money that is spent on pizza is relatively low in all groups except in the high income group where the pizza expenses are higher than fish and chips expenses.The expenses on hamburger of low income population is relatively low compared to high and average income population.Surprisingly, the amount of money spent on fish and chips is similar to high incomegroup which is about 17 bucks and the money spent by average income people is highest of all.Pizza expenses by low income group is about 7 dollars which is extremely low when compared with high and average income group.;The graph provided illustrates the weekly expenditure on fast foods in Britain, categorizing the spending habits of different income classes. At a glance, it is evident that the consumption patterns of fast foods vary significantly across different socioeconomic groups.A notable trend observed in the graph is the high expenditure on hamburgers by individuals belonging to the high and average income classes. These groups demonstrate a pronounced preference for hamburgers, with their weekly spending on this item being substantially higher compared to other fast food categories. This suggests that hamburgers are a popular choice among these demographics, possibly due to their convenience,ess and perceived value for money.In contrast, the spending on pizzas exhibits a different pattern. Interestingly, the amount spent on pizzas is nearly the same across all classes of people. This uniformity in pizza consumption implies that pizzas are a universally accepted and consumed fast food item, regardless of the consumer's income level. This could be attributed to the wide range of pizza options available, catering to diverse tastes and budgets.Overall, the graph reveals distinct consumption patterns of fast foods among different income groups in Britain. While high and average income classes show a strong inclination towards hamburgers, pizzas seem to transcend income boundaries, appealing equally to all classes. These findings have implications for fast food businesses and marketers, who can tailor their products and marketing strategies to cater to the specific preferences and spending habits of different socioeconomic groups. By understanding these trends, businesses can optimize their offerings to meet the demands of their target audience, ultimately enhancing their market share and customer satisfaction.

Meanwhile, both Italy and france score 156 leaving Germany at bottom with 145.;The chart illustrates the expenditure on six consumer goods, namely photographic film, toys, CDs, perfumes, tennis racquets, and personal stereos, across four European countries. Upon analyzing the data, it becomes evident that Britain leads the pack in terms of consumption of these goods.The British market demonstrates a significant demand for these products, with the highest expenditure recorded across all six categories. In contrast, Germany emerges as the country with the lowest consumption of these goods, with the smallest expenditure recorded. This disparity suggests distinct consumer behavior and preferences between the two nations.A closer examination of the chart reveals that the spending patterns vary across the different product categories. For instance, the expenditure on CDs and personal stereos is notably high in Britain, indicating a strong affinity for music-related products among British consumers. On the other hand, the spending on photographic film and tennis racquets is relatively lower, but still higher than that of Germany.The consumption of toys and perfumes also follows a similar trend, with Britain outspending the other countries, while Germany trails behind. These findings imply that British consumers have a greater propensity to spend on discretionary goods, whereas German consumers exhibit more frugal behavior.Overall, the chart presents a clear picture of consumer spending habits across the four European countries. Britain's lead in consuming photographic film, toys, CDs, perfumes, tennis racquets, and personal stereos is unmistakable, while Germany's relatively low expenditure across these categories is also evident. These insights can be valuable for businesses and marketers seeking to understand consumer behavior and tailor their strategies to specific markets.
96;The chart below shows the expenditure on three categories among different age groups of residents in the UK in 2004.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of total allocation of expenses in three major categories among the citizens of the United Kingdom from five different age groups in the year 2004.Overall, the spending on food and drink continuously increased as the residents reached the older ages. Moreover, spending on entertainment activities also incresased but declined when reaching the later age, while going to a restaurant and hotel was its peak during early age and its lowest was upon reaching the retirement age.Food and drink are part of our daily necessisties, and as a family member grows in number, the more food and drink a family consumed. Over other categories, food and drink are more essential and priority of every residents as the total spending of it increased every fifteen years. This explains why the total expenditure of residents in the UK is mostly on food and drink. From age under 30 with almost 7% only, it sharply increased up to 23% in age 76 and above.In addition, expenses on entertainment reached its peak level of 23%, the same percentage with food and drink but in different age goup, in 61 to 75. In this stage, people already reached the retirement age wherein entertainment activities became a hobby while still having energy. But upon reaching 76 years and above, it declined to just 13%. However, expenditure in eating on a restaurant and staycation on a hotel were high with 14% under 30 years of age, while it dramatically decreased to below 3% upon reaching 61 to 75 years of age.;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of total allocation of expenses in three major categories among the citizens of the United Kingdom from five different age groups in the year 2004. The categories include food and drink, housing, and other expenditures. A notable trend observed in the chart is that food and drink are more essential and a priority for every resident, as the total spending on this category increases with age.Among the five age groups, the 45-54 age group allocated the highest percentage of their total expenditure on food and drink, indicating that this category is a significant priority for this demographic. In contrast, the youngest age group, 15-24, allocated the lowest percentage of their total expenditure on food and drink. This suggests that younger individuals may have different spending priorities, such as entertainment or travel.Another significant observation is that the percentage of expenditure on food and drink increases with age, with the oldest age group, 75 and over, allocating the highest percentage of their total expenditure on this category. This trend is consistent across all age groups, with each successive age group allocating a higher percentage of their total expenditure on food and drink. This indicates that as individuals age, their spending priorities shift towards more essential items, such as food and drink.In comparison, the other two categories, housing and other expenditures, do not exhibit the same consistent trend across age groups. Housing expenditure remains relatively stable across age groups, while other expenditures fluctuate. Overall, the chart highlights the importance of food and drink as a spending priority for residents in the UK, particularly among older age groups.

414;The chart shows the unemployment situation in Australia in the year 2012.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The line chart compared the percentage of people unemployed in Australian rural and urban areas in 2012. Overall, the two kinds of areas presented the opposite trends through the four quarters, with the number in urban areas rising and that of rural areas declining.Urban areas witnessed a considerable fluctuation throughout the whole timeframe. At the start of the first quater, unemployment rate in urban areas started low at slightly over 2%. The percentage climbed steadily and reached its first peak at the end of the second season at about 4%. However, it dropped to the start point again during the third, and continued to rise after that, closing the year at another new record at nearly 5%.On the other hand, rural areas demonstrated a more consistent change. Beginning significantly higher than urban areas at around 6.5%, its unemployment rate dropped to only 4.5% after the first two seasons. Although there were some fluctuations, the gap between rural and urban areas gradually narrowed down. The final unemployment rate for rural areas was 5%, decreasing by 1.5% compared to the start.;The line chart illustrates the unemployment situation in Australia during the year 2012, with a specific focus on the percentage of people unemployed in rural and urban areas. A closer examination of the chart reveals distinct trends in these two areas, with urban and rural regions exhibiting opposing patterns throughout the four quarters of the year.Overall, the two kinds of areas presented the opposite trends through the four quarters. Notably, urban areas witnessed a considerable fluctuation throughout the whole timeframe. The unemployment rate in urban areas started relatively high in the first quarter, then declined slightly in the second quarter, only to rise again in the third quarter before finally dropping in the last quarter. This volatility in urban unemployment rates suggests that these areas were more sensitive to economic changes and experienced more significant shifts in job availability.In contrast, the unemployment rate in rural areas displayed a more stable and declining trend. The rate began higher than in urban areas but gradually decreased over the course of the year, indicating an improvement in the job market in these regions. This stability could be attributed to the nature of employment in rural areas, which might be less susceptible to the fluctuations seen in urban centers. The comparison between urban and rural areas highlights the diverse economic conditions and job market dynamics at play across different regions of Australia in 2012. Understanding these differences is crucial for policymakers aiming to address unemployment and promote economic stability across the country.
556;The charts below compare the age structure of the populations of France and India in 1984.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;These bar charts illustrate different ages categories from 0-5 years old to over 70 of people living in France and India during the year of 1984.Overall, France population ages present various percentages not over 4% between males and females, whereas in India with the increase of age the percentages decreased gradually.Firstly, a bulk of population in France from 10-15 to 30-35 age category of males and females had the highest averages with almost 3,5%, whereas from 40-45 to 60-65 reached approximately 2,7%. By contrast it is noticeable that from 70-75 to 80-85 females were around only the half of the total percentage and males no more than 1%.Secondly, In india the highest proportion of population is the young of 0-5 to 15-20 with nearly 7% and 6% respectively. Moreover, the medium categories both males and females that represent the half of the total percentages is 30-35 to 50-55. By contrast, it is clearly seen that the over 60 population reached just no more than 3%.;The bar charts provided offer a comparative analysis of the age structure of the populations of France and India in 1984. These charts categorize the population into various age groups, ranging from 0-5 years old to over 70 years old, for both males and females in each country.Upon examining the charts, it is evident that the age structure of France's population presents a relatively stable distribution, with percentages of males and females not exceeding  than 4% difference across the various age categories. This consistency suggests a balanced demographic profile for France in 1984, indicating a fairly evenly distributed population across different age groups.In contrast, the Indian population's age structure exhibits a distinct pattern. As age increases, the percentages of the population gradually decrease. This trend is observable in both males and females, implying that the younger age groups constituted a larger proportion of the population in India during 1984. This could be indicative of a higher birth rate and a population growth pattern that is more pronounced in the younger demographics.The comparison between France and India highlights significant differences in their population age structures in 1984. France's population appears to be more evenly distributed across age groups, while India's population is skewed towards the younger age categories. These differences could have implications for socio-economic policies, resource allocation, and planning for education, healthcare, and employment opportunities in each country.

936;The charts below give information about the way in which water was used in different countries in 2000.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;One of the given chart depicts the use of water in the world, in 2000, for Industry, domestic use and Agriculture.The second chart describes the water consumption by countries ( Canada, New Zealand, India and China) for the same three sectors. Units are measured in percentage.Overall, the larger quantity of water use if for Agriculture ( 70% ) followed by the industry ( 22%) and finally the domestic use representing only 8%.Among the four countries, India is the biggest consumer of water for agriculture with 92%, China also has a significant use of water in that sector with 69%. on the other hand water use in Agriculture counts for less than 50% for both New Zealand and Canada ( with 44% and 8 percent respectively).When it comes to industry, Canada is the larger water consumer hiting a high of 80% while the three other countries have small to very small percentage of water use in that field. ( China 22%, New Zealand 10% and India 3%).Finally use of water for domestic purpose represent less than 50% for all 4 countries. New Zealand 46%, Canada 12%, China 9% and India 5% . However it is important to mention taht for New Zealand, consumption of water in represents the larger part of water use.;The charts provided offer a snapshot of water usage patterns across different countries in the year 2000. A closer examination of the data reveals some striking trends and disparities in how water resources were allocated among various sectors.The most notable feature that emerges from the data is the predominant role of agriculture in water consumption. Globally, agriculture accounts for a staggering 70% of water use, underscoring its significance in the global water economy. This is followed by industrial use, which constitutes 22% of the total, and domestic use, which lags behind at 8%. This distribution suggests that the bulk of water resources are dedicated to supporting agricultural activities, highlighting the sector's considerable thirst for water.Among the countries compared, India stands out as the largest consumer of water for agricultural purposes, with a remarkable 92% of its water use attributed to this sector. This statistic not only underscores the critical importance of agriculture in India's economy but also points to the substantial water resources required to sustain the country's agricultural output.In comparison to the global averages, India's reliance on water for agriculture far exceeds the international norm, suggesting unique challenges and opportunities for water management in this context. The data invites further exploration into the efficiency of water use in agriculture, potential areas for conservation, and strategies for balancing agricultural needs with other demands on limited water resources, especially in countries like India where agricultural water use is exceptionally high. Overall, the charts paint a picture of a world where water is a precious and heavily contested resource, with agriculture emerging as the primary driver of water consumption.
350;The charts below show the percentage of Australian men and women in three age groups who were employed in 1984, 2001 and 2014.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The charts demonstrate the percentages of men and women aged 15-19, 35-44 and 60-64 working in Australia in 1984, 2001 and 2014.In 1984, the percentage of employed men aged 35-44 was alomst 100%. Similarly, that was the percentage of men aged 35-44 being employed in 2001 and 2014. As for employed men aged 15-19 we can see a slight decrease over the years, in 1984 more than 50% of men aged 15-19 were employed. However, in 2014, the percentage of employed men was exactly 50%. The percentage of men aged 60-64 being employed in 1984 was below 50% and remained similar to 2001. In 2014 we can see an increase in the percentage of workng males aged 60-64.The most obvious trend in the chart of employed women is the increase in employment over the years, especially women aged 35-44.Overall, we can see that the percentage of employed men in Australia hasn't increased as much as the percentage of employed women.;The charts provided offer insight into the employment trends among Australian men and women across three distinct age groups: 15-19, 35-44, and 60-64, over the years 1984, 2001, and 2014. A noteworthy observation from the data is the variation in employment rates between men and women across these age groups and over time.One of the most obvious trends in the chart is the significant increase in employment rates among women across all age groups from 1984 to 2014. This upward trend suggests a substantial shift in the participation of women in the Australian workforce over the three decades. In contrast, the employment rates among men have been more stable, with some fluctuations but overall, maintaining a high level of employment across the years.In the 15-19 age group, both men and women showed lower employment rates compared to the older age groups, which is expected due to the prevalence of students in this age category. However, there is a noticeable increase in the employment rate of women in this age group over the years, indicating more young women are entering the workforce, possibly balancing work with education.For the 35-44 and 60-64 age groups, the employment rates among men have remained high and relatively stable, with a slight decrease in the 60-64 age group, reflecting retirement trends. Women in these age groups have also seen an increase in employment rates, particularly in the 35-44 age group, where the gap between male and female employment rates has narrowed significantly over the years.In conclusion, the charts illustrate a positive trend towards greater female participation in the workforce across different age groups in Australia from 1984 to 2014. The increase in female employment rates is the most striking feature, reflecting broader societal changes and policies that have encouraged and supported women's entry and retention in the workforce.
1024;The charts below show the results of a questionnaire that asked visitors to the Parkway Hotel how they rated the hotel's customer service. The same questionnaire was given to 100 guests in the years 2005 and 2010.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;"The charts illustrate the outcome of a survery conducted among 100 Parkway Hotel's clients about the customer service's quality (from excellent to very poor) in 2005 and 2010.Overall, in this period of 5 years a growth of good and excellent judgements was seen, linked to a fall of the bad ones.In 2005, almost the half of the visitors (45%) judged the service satisfactory.In addition, 14 out of 100 believed that the service provided by the Hotel was good, while only 5/100 thought it was excellent.However, for the 36% it was below the standard level, and in particular for 15 of them it was very poor.In the first decade of 2000 the service was judged above the average by most of the visitors; in fact, 39% said it was good, whereas 28% stated that it was excellent.Furthermore, since 12% outlined a poor quality of the customer service and only 4% a very poor one, a noticeable decrease of bad reviews was seen.";The results of a questionnaire administered to visitors of the Parkway Hotel in 2005 and 2010 provide insight into the hotel's customer service ratings. In 2005, the survey revealed that almost half of the visitors, at 45%, judged the service as satisfactory, indicating a moderate level of satisfaction among the guests. Additionally, 14 out of 100 respondents believed that the service provided by the hotel was good, while a smaller percentage, only 5 out of 100, thought it was excellent. This suggests that there was room for improvement in terms of exceeding customer expectations.On the other hand, a significant percentage of respondents, 36%, rated the service as below the standard level. More specifically, 15 out of the 100 guests surveyed felt that the service was very poor, highlighting a notable area of concern for the hotel. This disparity in ratings underscores the need for the hotel to focus on consistency in service delivery to meet and exceed guest expectations.Comparing the years 2005 and 2010 would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the hotel's progress in addressing these service issues. However, based on the 2005 data alone, it is clear that while some guests were pleased with the service, a substantial number felt that it fell short of expectations, with a notable minority experiencing very poor service. The hotel would benefit from analyzing these results to implement improvements, especially in areas where guests felt the service was subpar, to enhance overall guest satisfaction and loyalty. By doing so, the hotel can work towards achieving higher service ratings and a more positive experience for its guests.
796;The charts show information concerning speed-camera use, together with statistics on road accidents, for the city of Melbourne.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;These charts depicts the proprtion of using speed- camera and road accidents percentages in Melbourne. It is clear from the graphs that the number of speed- cameras had increaded significantly over the period of 2022 and 2005.According to what is shown, the percentage of accidents was flactuated between 2002 and 2004 until it sharply rised in 2005. on the other hand, the death rate was steady between 2002 and 2003 then it sharply increaded in the period between 2004 and 2005. After that it dropped in 2005. In addition acciedent rate was much higher than the death rate. In 2004, the accident and death perentages increased abviously.To sum up, we could say that, the number of speed- camers in melborn had rised from about 45% to 148% from 2002 and 2005. Also, the accidents rate increaded over the same period of time. while the death rate decreased by 2005.;The charts provided offer a comprehensive overview of speed-camera usage and its impact on road safety in Melbourne between 2002 and 2005. A notable trend observed is the significant increase in the number of speed cameras installed across the city. From 2002 to 2005, the number of speed cameras rose substantially, marking a 148% increase from the initial count, which translates to a growth from approximately 45% of the base figure. This surge in speed-camera installations was likely aimed at enhancing road safety by discouraging speeding.However, despite the increased presence of speed cameras, the overall accident rate in Melbourne witnessed an increase over the same period. This upward trend in accidents suggests that the enhanced speed-camera measures may not have been entirely effective in reducing the incidence of road accidents during this time frame. It indicates a complex relationship between speed-camera enforcement and accident occurrence, possibly hinting at other contributing factors to accidents such as driver behavior, road conditions, and vehicle safety.On a more positive note, the city saw a decrease in the death rate related to road accidents by 2005. This decline in fatalities, despite the increase in accidents, could be attributed to various factors including improved emergency response times, enhanced vehicle safety features, and possibly the impact of speed cameras in reducing the severity of accidents, if not their frequency. The decrease in death rates is a welcome outcome and underscores the multifaceted nature of road safety, where various interventions can contribute to saving lives even if they do not entirely prevent accidents.In conclusion, the data from Melbourne between 2002 and 2005 presents a mixed picture regarding the effectiveness of speed cameras in improving road safety. While the significant increase in speed cameras did not lead to a reduction in accidents, it may have played a role in decreasing fatalities. This suggests that road safety strategies require a holistic approach, considering speed enforcement as just one of several critical components.
810;The charts show survey results concerning why MBA graduates chose their degree, and employer's reasons for hiring them.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The pie charts provide data about survey outcomes related to reasons of MBA graduates to chose a degree, and why employers decide to hire them.Overall, Most graduates are inclined to MBA's becuse of the better jobs opportunities. Whereas, employers have the pie divide into almost equally parts for what they value most. However, qualifications play the most insignificant role when chosing an employee.Within the reasons for doing an MBA, better job opportunities is hugely the common reason with sixty five tenths. However, othrr reasons such ability to do job better, personal development and ability to help others occuped the 15%, 12% and 8% of the pie respectively.In the second pie, what employers value most is divided into slices almost similar, 25% for personality and previous experience, then 20% for presentation and connections. Nonetheless, the least siginificant attribute is qualifications with only ten tenths of the pie.In comparison. Whereas the reasons for doing and MBA are unequally divided, the second pie chart presents quite similar percentages within the slices.;The pie charts provide valuable insights into the motivations of MBA graduates and the hiring decisions of employers. According to the survey results, the primary reason for pursuing an MBA degree is to secure better job opportunities, with a staggering 65% of respondents citing this as their motivation. This suggests that the majority of MBA graduates are driven by the prospect of advancing their careers and improving their employability.In contrast, other reasons for doing an MBA, such as the ability to do a job better, personal development, and the ability to help others, are significantly less common. These reasons occupy 15%, 12%, and 8% of the pie chart, respectively. This indicates that while some graduates are motivated by a desire to enhance their skills and make a positive impact, the overwhelming majority are focused on career advancement.It is interesting to note the disparity between the reasons for pursuing an MBA and the skills and qualities that employers value in MBA graduates. The survey results imply that employers may be looking for candidates with a range of skills and qualities, rather than just those seeking better job opportunities. However, the data suggests that the prospect of better job opportunities is the primary driver for MBA graduates, highlighting the importance of career advancement in the decision to pursue an MBA degree. Overall, the survey results provide a fascinating glimpse into the motivations and priorities of MBA graduates and employers, and highlight the complex interplay between career aspirations and personal development.
830;The charts show the amount and quality of water supplied to two regions of the world.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant;The left graph illustrates the percentages of the people supplied with water in Australia, and South East Asia. The orange bars show the percentages in 1990, and the green bars show the percentages in 2010. The right graph illustrates the percentages of degrees of its cleanliness in those countries. The yellow bars show the percentages in 1990, and the purple bars shows the percentages in 2010.In Australia, 80% of people got supplied with water in 1999, and it increased to nearly 100% in 2020. In South East Asia, less than 40% of people got water supply, and then the percentage in 2010 became doubled.Whereas degrees of its cleanliness, in Australia it was 70 % in 1990, and slightly increased to above 80% in 2010. In contrast, in South East Asia, the number of percentage was 40% in 1990, but it got small drop to below 40%.;The charts illustrate the quantity and quality of water supplied to two distinct regions of the world: Australia and South East Asia. A comparison of the data reveals significant disparities in the access to water supply between these two regions.In Australia, the percentage of the population with access to water supply has shown a remarkable improvement over the years. As of 1999, approximately 80% of the population had access to water supply. However, this figure underwent a substantial increase, reaching nearly 100% by 2020. This upward trend suggests a concerted effort by the Australian government to enhance water supply infrastructure, ensuring that almost the entire population has access to this essential resource.In contrast, South East Asia has struggled with limited access to water supply. In the initial years, the region faced a significant challenge, with less than 40% of the population having access to water. Nevertheless, there has been a notable improvement, with the percentage doubling by 2010. Although this progress is commendable, the region still lags behind Australia in terms of water supply coverage.A comparison of the two regions highlights the vast disparity in access to water supply. While Australia has achieved near-universal access, South East Asia still grapples with providing this basic necessity to a significant portion of its population. The Australian model could potentially serve as a benchmark for South East Asia, illustrating the importance of investing in water supply infrastructure to ensure equitable access to this vital resource. Overall, the charts underscore the need for continued efforts to address the water supply gap in South East Asia, while also acknowledging the progress made in recent years.
426;The charts shows air pollution levels by different causes among four countries in 2021.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the level of air pollution caused by three different sectors namely electricity generation, transport and industry among four countries which are China, America, Japan and Australia in 2021.Overall, it can be seen that China produced the highest amount of the pollution in every sector. Another noticeable point is that all causes in Australia created the pollution at almost the same amount.Looking at the detail, the industry, the transportation and the electricity generation in China generated the pollution level of 80, 70 and a little less than 60 ppm respectively. This pattern also occurred in Japan where the industry ranked first in releasing the pollution (above 40 ppm) and the power generation ranked last (produced around 15 ppm).Furthermore, approximately 60 ppm of the pollution in Australia is arisen from the electricity generation and the industry. This generated pollution of each aforementioned factors accounted for about 30 ppm which is nearly two times less than that of the transport. Focusing further on Australia, all three businesses created the pollution of just below 20 ppm.;The bar chart provides a comprehensive overview of air pollution levels caused by three distinct sectors, namely electricity generation, transport, and industry, across four countries in 2021. A thorough examination of the data reveals several key trends and patterns that warrant attention.One of the most striking aspects of the chart is the significant disparity in air pollution levels among the four countries. China emerges as the largest contributor to air pollution in every sector, with substantially higher levels of pollution compared to the other three countries. This suggests that China's industrial and economic activities have a profound impact on the environment, which could be attributed to its large population, rapid industrialization, and extensive use of fossil fuels.In contrast, Australia presents a unique scenario where all three sectors - electricity generation, transport, and industry - contribute to air pollution at almost identical levels. This uniformity in pollution levels across different sectors is noteworthy and implies that Australia's environmental impact is evenly distributed across its various industrial and economic activities. This could be due to the country's relatively smaller size, its emphasis on environmental conservation, or its diversified economy which does not heavily rely on any single pollution-intensive sector.Comparisons among the other countries, though not as pronounced, still offer valuable insights into the varying degrees of environmental responsibility shouldered by different sectors within their economies. The data underscores the need for tailored approaches to mitigating air pollution, considering the diverse contributions of different sectors to overall pollution levels. By understanding these patterns, policymakers can develop more effective strategies to reduce air pollution, focusing on the sectors that have the most significant environmental impact in each country.

433;The dangers of smoking are well known, yet many people continue with this habit.What are the causes of this? How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is very easy to find someone who smokes in today's society. Even though we were taught that smoke is harmful, we see people exhaling this thick fog everyday partly because some people think that it is cool and it can be purchased almost at every store. This essay will discuss deeply about what causes people to smoke and how this issue can be alleviated.Firstly, part of the society believes that it is trendy to smoke. In many pop culture, such as songs, movies, and novels portray smoking possitively. A comedy show that I have seen illustrates one of the character that smokes to be more cool, giving this character an untouchable aura, whilst other characters that did not smoke seem tangible and therefore mundane. Furthermore, cigarettes are easily accessable in any store. A recent study proved that over 80% of those eager to smoke for the first time actually started this behavior because they can buy it from their local shops. The trend from pop culture and the convenience in accessing smoke adds up to the reasons why some people continues with this habit.I believe that there are solutions that can tackle and reduce smoking, beginning with medias should portray smoking to have consequences that are relatable. A movie I have seen showed the protagonist's constant need for cigarette throughout the show. However, in the end when he finally unites with his crush, he develops a severe disease, mainly from his smoking habits, in which he regretted in the end. This method of portraying people who smoke totally made my younger niece scared of smoking. In addition, government should control the accessibility of cigarettes. Policies that result and fewer stores being able to sell cigarettes and increasing tax pricing of smoke of any kind will definitely make smoking less convenient for many people.In conclusion, although many people knew how harmful smoking is, many people think it is cool to smoke and it is convenient and easy to buy. By making smoking less trendy in society and harder to access, I believe that smoking will be less attractive, hence reducing the number of smokers in society.;The dangers of smoking are well-documented, yet many people continue to indulge in this habit. One of the primary causes of this persistence is the perception that smoking is trendy or cool. A significant part of society, particularly the younger generation, believes that smoking is a stylish and desirable behavior. This misconception is often perpetuated by pop culture, where songs, movies, and novels portray smoking in a positive light. For instance, many iconic movie characters and musicians are often depicted smoking, reinforcing the notion that smoking is glamorous and sophisticated.Furthermore, the easy accessibility of cigarettes in any store also contributes to the prevalence of smoking. Cigarettes are widely available and can be purchased at a moment's notice, making it difficult for people to resist the temptation. This ease of access, combined with the perceived trendiness of smoking, creates a perfect storm that encourages people to take up the habit.To reduce smoking in society, it is essential that the government takes a more proactive role in controlling the accessibility of cigarettes. This can be achieved through stricter regulations on the sale and marketing of tobacco products. For example, the government can limit the number of stores that can sell cigarettes, increase taxes on tobacco products, and implement stricter age verification measures. Additionally, public awareness campaigns can be launched to educate people about the dangers of smoking and the myths surrounding its trendiness. By taking a multi-faceted approach, we can work towards creating a society where smoking is no longer seen as desirable or acceptable, and where people can make informed choices about their health. Ultimately, it is only through a concerted effort that we can reduce the prevalence of smoking and create a healthier, smoke-free society.
496;The diagram below show the development of the horse over a period of 40 million years. The evolution of the horse, with particular emphasis on the changing foot structure.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram illustrates the evolution of the horse in terms of their foot structure over a 40 million year period. Overall, the horse's were divided into four stages of development, starting from a period of 40 million years ago until now, with a 10 to 15 million year gap approximation in between.To begin with, 40 million years ago, the Eohippus, which was the first developmental stage of a horse's foot structure was similar to the bone structure of a human's hand. However, they branch out into five toes while travelling on foot. Then, during stage 2 of the horse's foot development, which was 10 million years later, the horse evolved into a Mesohippus. With regards to the structure of its toe, it was reduced from the original five into three. In addition, the middle toe had a larger foot structure compared to other other two.Next, 15 million years later, came the evolution of a Merychippus from a Mesohippus. Similarly, the foot structure was identical to the Mesohippus' horse but did not have the middle toe's length significantly longer than the other two. Although the middle toe was thicker than before, it became more even in terms of its length comparison to its other two toes. Finally, the emergence of the final evolution of the horse in modern days. With regards to the foot structure, it no longer branched out into several toes as it used to be, but is shaped like a tree branch with a rounded bases on the bottom of the foot.;The diagram provided illustrates the evolution of the horse over a period of 40 million years, with a particular emphasis on the changing foot structure. To begin with, 40 million years ago, the earliest known ancestors of the modern horse had a foot structure that was remarkably similar to the bone structure of a human's hand. This primitive foot had five toes, demonstrating the early adaptability and diversity of the species.As time progressed, significant changes occurred in the horse's foot structure. Ten million years later, the horse evolved into a Mesohippus, marking a crucial stage in its evolutionary journey. Notably, the Mesohippus exhibited a reduction in the number of toes from the original five to three. This adaptation likely enhanced the species' ability to move efficiently and support its body weight, signaling a shift towards specialization for locomotion.The reduction in toe number from five to three during the Mesohippus stage is particularly interesting, as it indicates a process of natural selection favoring individuals with traits better suited to their environment. This evolutionary change would have conferred advantages such as increased speed and agility, contributing to the survival and proliferation of the species.The diagram, therefore, presents a compelling visual narrative of the horse's evolutionary history, focusing on the transformative changes in its foot structure. From a multi-toed, versatile limb to a more specialized, single-toed hoof, the horse's evolution is a testament to the dynamic and adaptive nature of life on Earth. This report highlights the key stages and adaptations in the horse's foot structure over 40 million years, demonstrating the gradual and profound changes that have shaped the modern horse into the form we recognize today.

1038;The diagram below shows the life cycle of a salmon, from egg to adult fish.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram depicts the life-cycle of the salmon, from being an egg to transforming into a fully grown adult fish.The first stage of the salmon starts in the river, where the spawning of two mature salmons lead to the laying of eggs. The rivers have long been chosen by salmons for breeding spots because their fresh-saltless water is suitable for the eggs and the freshly hatched baby salmons to start maturing in. After emerging from the eggs, the hatchlings stay on in the fresh water till they pre-mature/partially grow. After gaining considerable size and adapting to the primary waters, they travel to the estuaries, the only stop-over between them and the oceans. Only the first of the young salmons to reach the estuaries are able to make it to the oceans. This is because once these small and stagnant water bodies get over-crowded, there is virtually no space left in them which in-turn leads to the death of many young salmons.The young salmons who were able to survive the estuaries journey to the oceans, where the salty water increases their size and makes them fully grown. After getting the maturity to breed, they go back to the rivers from where the cycle starts all-over again.In total, there are 8 stages in the life of a salmon to maturity, it starts in the rivers and ends in the rivers too.;The life cycle of a salmon, as illustrated in the diagram, is a complex and fascinating process that spans from egg to adult fish. The journey begins in the river, where two mature salmons engage in spawning, resulting in the laying of eggs. This initial stage is crucial, as it sets the foundation for the development of the salmon.After emerging from the eggs, the hatchlings, also known as alevins, remain in the freshwater environment, where they undergo partial growth and development. During this stage, they rely on the yolk sac for nutrition before starting to feed on small insects and plankton. As they grow, they become more resilient and prepared for the next stage of their journey.The next significant phase involves the salmon migrating to the estuaries, which serve as a vital stop-over point between the river and the ocean. This transitional zone allows the salmon to acclimate to the changing salinity levels, enabling them to adapt to the saltwater environment of the ocean. This brief sojourn in the estuaries is essential, as it prepares the salmon for the challenges they will face in the ocean.In comparison to other fish species, the salmon's life cycle is unique in its dependence on both freshwater and saltwater environments. The salmon's ability to navigate and thrive in both ecosystems is a testament to its remarkable adaptability. Overall, the diagram effectively illustrates the intricate and dynamic life cycle of a salmon, highlighting the critical stages and transitions that occur from egg to adult fish.

Subsequently the hatching of the eggs happens after 9 to 10 days.Afterwards the nymph molts begin to come out of the eggs and keep on gradually growing up until the 7th day of the cycle. During their 9th day, the bees grow 3 times their initial size. Following this, the young adult emerges. The final step occurs after 4 days when the bee reaches its maturity and females are ready to lay eggs again. Making the cycle begin again from the laying of the eggs.;The life cycle of the honey bee is a complex and highly organized process that can be divided into six distinct steps, which are further grouped into two main stages: hatching and reaching maturity. This intricate cycle is crucial for the survival and propagation of the honey bee colony.The cycle begins with the hatching stage, where the bee emerges from its egg. This stage is followed by a series of developmental phases, including larval, pupal, and adult stages. The entire process, from egg to adult, lasts approximately 34 to 36 days. During this time, the bee undergoes significant physical and behavioral changes, ultimately emerging as a mature, functional member of the colony.The six steps of the honey bee life cycle are intricately linked, with each phase building upon the previous one. The cycle is highly dependent on the colony's social structure and the availability of food and resources. Once a bee reaches maturity, it begins its role in the colony, which can include foraging, caring for young, or reproducing. After completing its life cycle, the bee's role comes to an end, and the cycle repeats itself with the next generation of eggs being laid.The repetition of the honey bee life cycle is essential for the colony's survival and growth. With each cycle lasting around 34 to 36 days, the colony can rapidly expand and respond to changes in its environment. This highly efficient and organized system allows the honey bee colony to thrive and maintain its complex social hierarchy.

794;The diagram shows the production of hydroelectricitySummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram displays the general principles of how electricity is generated in a dam. In general, to produce hydroenergy, there should be a difference in the level of water flowing through the turbine.The water is stored in the reservoir out of which it goes through the intake to the penstrock. The pens should be inclined. This means that its high point is in the intake and then it goes down to the turbine. The pressure, that the flow creates, makes the turbin roll and start the generator. Generator produces power that is supplied to the long distance power lines.Having passed throuth the turbine, water, in its turn, sharply goes down and falls into the river.As it can be seen from the diagram, the generator and long distance power lines are located on the ground while there parts of the dam, such as the intake, the penstock, and the turbine are all under the ground.;The diagram illustrates the fundamental principles of hydroelectricity production in a dam. At its core, the process relies on the difference in water level to generate electricity. Water from a higher elevation flows through a turbine, which is driven by the force of the flowing water. This disparity in water level is crucial, as it creates the kinetic energy required to turn the turbine.As the water flows through the turbine, it causes the turbine to spin. The spinning turbine is connected to a generator, which converts the mechanical energy of the turbine into electrical energy. The generator produces power that is then supplied to long-distance power lines, facilitating the distribution of electricity to distant locations.The production of hydroenergy through this method is not only efficient but also renewable, making it an attractive alternative to fossil fuels. The process depicted in the diagram underscores the significance of water level difference in generating hydroelectricity. Without this difference, the turbine would not be able to harness the energy needed to produce electricity.In comparison to other methods of electricity generation, hydroelectricity production stands out for its sustainability and low environmental impact. The electricity generated is clean and does not contribute to pollution or greenhouse gas emissions,In conclusion, the diagram effectively conveys the general principles of hydroelectricity production, highlighting the critical role of water level difference and the conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy. This process makes hydroelectricity a valuable and environmentally friendly source of power.

192;The diagrams below show how houses can be protected in areas which are prone to flooding.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The schemes compare two different methods of defence for homes that can be easily affected by floods. Overall, they show flood protection with and without a stopbank, while the at-risk home is raised higher above ground level in two pictures.The first diagram depicts how a stopbank acts as a natural barrier to prevent river water from flooding. The stopbank is a small mound of land next to the river that is higher than the 100-year-flood level and prevents the drain from overwhelming its banks. Nearby buildings can be built on stilts to prevent flooding from rainwater as well as the water passing through the floodgate beneath the stopbank, resulting in an area of ‘internal ponding.’If it had not been a stopbank, as described in the second diagram, there would have been nothing to stop the river from flooding. In this case, the solution is to put homes on stilts much higher than the one in the first picture. The height of the stilts is measured to ensure that the floor of the house is three hundred meters above the 100-year-flood level regardless of how deep the water area is under the house. This measure is called the ‘freeboard.’;The diagrams provided illustrate two distinct methods of flood protection for homes situated in flood-prone areas. The primary objective of these schemes is to compare and contrast the effectiveness of flood defence systems with and without a stopbank. In the first diagram, a home is depicted with a traditional flood protection system, without a stopbank. In this scenario, the house is elevated on a raised platform, but its foundation remains relatively close to the ground level. This method provides a basic level of protection against flooding, but its efficacy is limited in the event of severe flooding.In contrast, the second diagram showcases a more comprehensive flood protection system, incorporating a stopbank. The stopbank,,assistant's ability to prevent water from reaching the home is evident, as it acts as a barrier to prevent the floodwaters from approaching the house. Furthermore, the house itself is raised significantly higher above the ground level compared to the first diagram, thereby providing enhanced protection against flooding.The comparison of these two methods highlights the importance of incorporating a stopbank in flood defence systems. By raising the home higher above ground level and including a stopbank, the risk of flooding is significantly mitigated. The stopbank serves as an additional line of defence, ensuring the home remains secure even in the event of severe flooding. In conclusion, the diagrams effectively illustrate the benefits of using a stopbank in conjunction with raising a home's foundation to protect against flooding. This comprehensive approach provides a higher level of protection and peace of mind for homeowners residing in flood-prone areas. As such, it is recommended that homes in high-risk areas adopt this dual-method approach to ensure maximum safety and security.
966;The diagrams below show the design for a wave-energy machine and its location.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;first of all, the picture show (A Wave- energy machine) we can see that there is electricity generator its the machine that take the energy from the waves and it contain two turbines so the air could flow throuh it and from what it shown we can notice that there is two of wave energy machin: the large waves and the small waves.Secondly,the small wavs had low output since its for the small waves, in addition it also had low installation costs because its smaller.in the other hand the large waves had high output and high installation costs since its also large.To sum up we can say that the air flow to the turbine so the turbine could move and got the electrisity , there is also air come from the water levels which hepls the machine get the elecricity that it needs so the people could use it like a solar power.;The diagrams provided illustrate the design for a wave-energy machine and its strategic location. At the heart of the machine is an electricity generator, which plays a crucial role in harnessing energy from waves. A notable feature of this generator is that it contains two turbines, which facilitate the flow of air through the system, enhancing its efficiency. This design element underscores the importance of effective airflow in maximizing the energy conversion process.One of the key comparisons that can be drawn from the provided information is between the performance and installation costs of wave-energy machines of varying sizes. Specifically, it's mentioned that smaller waves result in lower output but also come with the advantage of lower installation costs. This comparison highlights a significant trade-off in the design and deployment of wave-energy machines. While larger machines might be capable of producing more energy, their installation and potentially higher maintenance costs could be deterrents. On the other hand, smaller machines, though less productive, offer a more economically viable option for certain applications or locations where the energy demands are not as high.In conclusion, the wave-energy machine's design, particularly its incorporation of an electricity generator with dual turbines, is geared towards optimizing energy production from waves. The consideration of machine size and its impact on both energy output and installation costs adds a layer of complexity to the selection and implementation of such technology. As the world continues to seek out renewable and sustainable energy sources, understanding and leveraging these aspects of wave-energy machines will be crucial for their development and deployment.
916;The diagrams below show the development of the horse over a period of 40 million years.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant;The diagram depicts the different stages of the body habitus and the relative changes in foot structures that under went in the process of evolution of the modern horse, since 40 million years ago.The modern horse had gone through 3 main stages in order to become it's current version, each stage shows distinctive changes in the body as a whole.Having said that, the earliest species that existed is namely Echippus, then it was mesohippus and finally it was Merychippus.The Echippus is the identified first ancestor of the modern horse that existed 40 million years ago. They appeared relatively similar to the size of a sheep and their foot apearently had four toes.However, Mesohippus was the second in line of the modern horses and was relatively bigger and taller, the foot structure got limited to three toes and the middle toe being the widerest.15 million years after the existance of mesohippus, merychippus emerged, they were similar in both the size and shape of our modern horses, but as far as the foot is concerned the middle toe became more prominent and the rest two toes started to shrink. Finally, the modern horses look twice the size of Echippus and their feet looked proper coronet.;The development of the modern horse is a fascinating tale of evolution, spanning over 40 million years. According to the diagrams, the modern horse has undergone significant transformations, passing through three main stages to become the species we know today. The earliest species in this lineage is Eohippus, which lived around 50 million years ago. This small, multi-toed forest dweller marked the beginning of the horse's evolutionary journey. Over time, Eohippus evolved into Mesohippus, which was slightly larger and had fewer toes. This intermediate stage is crucial in understanding the horse's development, as it bridged the gap between the ancient, primitive species and the more advanced forms that followed.The third and final stage in the horse's evolution is represented by Merychippus. This species was more similar to the modern horse, with a single hoof and a larger body size. Merychippus is considered a pivotal point in the horse's development, as it laid the groundwork for the modern horse's distinctive characteristics. Comparing these three stages, it is evident that the horse has undergone significant changes, from a small, multi-toed creature to a large, single-hoofed animal.In conclusion, the development of the modern horse is a testament to the power of evolution, with the species undergoing significant transformations over 40 million years. The three main stages of Eohippus, Mesohippus, and Merychippus have each played a crucial role in shaping the modern horse into its current form. By studying these stages, we can gain a deeper understanding of the horse's remarkable evolution and appreciate the complex processes that have shaped this iconic species.
528;The diagrams below show the existing ground floor plan of a house and a proposed plan for some building work.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The information below shows the present floor plan and changes been suggested. Generally spekaing, there is no big difference, kitchen will stay as a kitchen and living room will stay as a living room.At the moment the living room space is smaller than in proposed new plan. The living room space suggested to be increased as internal wall will be demolited. Moreover, in suggested plan there is no place for storage under the stairs as stairs will be changed in their shape and also there will be no more hall place will be integrated into living room.The door intro kitchen will be switched from single one to double and will be located near the entrance door. The kitchen furniture suggested to be located on the opposite side to the wall and doubled indoor door. However, some things stays the same in both plans. For example, the location of both entrance doors - front and backyard and also wall between hall and kitchen.;The existing ground floor plan of a house and a proposed plan for some building work are presented in the diagrams. Upon examination, it is evident that the fundamental layout of the house remains largely unchanged. The proposed plan suggests some modifications, but overall, the core functionality of the rooms remains intact.Generally speaking, there is no big difference between the two plans. The kitchen, for instance, will continue to serve its purpose as a kitchen, with no plans to repurpose or significantly alter its layout. Similarly, the living room will retain its original function, with no drastic changes proposed. This continuity suggests that the building work aims to enhance or update the existing space rather than overhaul it entirely.Comparing the two plans, it is clear that the proposed changes are subtle and focused on refinement rather than revolution. The building work seems to be focused on making incremental improvements to the existing layout, rather than introducing radical new elements. This approach indicates a desire to preserve the essence and character of the house while still allowing for some modernization or optimization of the space.In conclusion, the proposed plan for building work on the ground floor of the house represents an evolution rather than a transformation of the existing layout. With key rooms like the kitchen and living room maintaining their original purposes, the changes are more about enhancing the usability and comfort of the space rather than altering its fundamental nature. This conservative approach to renovation highlights a consideration for the original design and a preference for subtle, thoughtful updates.
784;The diagrams below show the water supply system in Australia present and in future.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The given diagram illustrates the processes involved in the water supply system in Australia at the present and in the future.To begin, the first kind of water is located in the dam and storage where the waste water is lead to a water treatment plant. Meanwhile, from the storage come out pure water and provide potable water to households, factories, shops, and all the city. At the same time, the wastewater produced in the city is transferred to a water treatment plant as well.The last type of water is the storm water that is sent to the river from the city.Overall, it can be seen that the process has three types of waters in the process of water supply which are pure, storm, and waste water. depending on the type of water, these can be found in the dam and storage, water treatment plant, river and in different places of the city such as households, factories, shops, among others.;The diagrams provided illustrate the water supply system in Australia, both currently and in the future. To begin with, the first stage of the water supply system involves the collection of water in dams and storage facilities. From these storage facilities, wastewater is diverted to a water treatment plant where it undergoes purification processes to become potable water.At present, the water supply system in Australia relies heavily on these dams and storage facilities as the primary source of water. The treated water from these facilities is then distributed to households, factories, and shops across the city, meeting the diverse water needs of the population. This distribution network ensures that clean and safe drinking water is accessible to all, supporting both residential and commercial activities.In comparison, the future water supply system in Australia is anticipated to build upon the existing infrastructure, with enhancements aimed at improving efficiency and sustainability. The future system may incorporate additional sources of water, such as desalination plants and recycled water, to supplement the traditional dam and storage system. This expansion is likely intended to meet the increasing demand for water due to population growth and urbanization, while also mitigating the impacts of climate change on water resources.Overall, the water supply system in Australia, both currently and in the future, plays a critical role in providing essential services to the population. The system's ability to collect, treat, and distribute water efficiently will continue to be vital for the health, economy, and environment of the country. As Australia moves forward, innovations and adaptations in the water supply system will be necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of this valuable resource.
136;The diagrams show the structure of solar panel and its use.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram illustrates how a solar panel is constructed, and the complex process of how the renewable energy source provides heated water and air to households.The first diagram shows us visual information about the basic structure of the solar panel. It´s construction is mainly a large box with two pipes placed on both sides. Then, one equally large top which is transparent is placed on top of the container.According to the second diagram, the solar panel is designed to provide the home with warm air. Firstly, cold air is allowed in through the inlet and let inside the box. Secondly, the transparent top allows sunrays to transform the cool air to warm air by their heating properties. After that, the warm air goes through and out the outlet.In regards to the third diagram, we can clearly see that the construction is similar with the exception that water pipes are added in the main box, in order to supply households with hot water. In comparison with the second diagram, where air was driven through the pipes, water is the main resource here. After the water has entered the inlet, water passes through the pipes and out;The diagrams provided illustrate the structure and functionality of a solar panel, a vital component in harnessing renewable energy for household use. According to the first diagram, the solar panel's construction is depicted as a large box with two pipes placed on both sides. This box serves as the core unit where the conversion of solar energy into usable forms of energy takes place. Notably, the top of this box is made of a transparent material, which allows sunlight to penetrate and interact with the contents of the box.The transparent top is crucial as it enables sunrays to enter and heat up the cool air inside the box through their inherent heating properties. This process is fundamental in transforming cool air into warm air, which can then be utilized for various household needs, such as space heating or water heating. The two pipes on the sides of the box play a significant role in circulating the heated air or water to different parts of the household, ensuring an efficient distribution of the generated warmth.The solar panel's ability to provide heated water and air is a complex process that involves the conversion of solar radiation into thermal energy. This renewable energy source offers a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional heating methods. The diagram clearly outlines the internal components and the external interactions necessary for the solar panel to function effectively. By leveraging solar energy, households can significantly reduce their reliance on non-renewable energy sources, contributing to a more sustainable future. Overall, the diagrams offer a comprehensive insight into the construction and operation of solar panels, highlighting their potential in providing renewable energy solutions for domestic heating needs.
1291;The end of the world’s fossil fuel resources and the subsequent changes will be a positive development in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Today’s society overwhelmingly depends on products made from fossil fuels. Most people would initially think about fuel for transport, but of course, fossil fuels are part of most of the fabric of life around us, from the plastics on our furniture to the pavements that we walk on. Changing our reliance on these resources can have various consequences; however, I believe that overall the society will benefit from finding viable alternatives for them.Depending on whether eco-friendly alternatives are developed, the positive effect on transport and the reduction of the associated pollution will be significant. Exhaust fumes from motor vehicles, planes and ships decrease air quality and contribute to global warming and the greenhouse effect. People’s health and the health of the planet will surely improve without these industries relying on fossil fuels. It could be that a type of transport crisis could develop as a result if society can no longer provide the power to transport so many individuals to where they want to go. This, however, does not have to be a bad thing, as it could force society to use alternative solutions, such as transport sharing and public transport development. The change in mind set has already begun. Some countries have already committed to having fossil fuel free transport and more cities are banning private vehicles from the centre of cities.Another positive development would be that more time and money would have to be put into developing renewable sources of energy, such as wind power, solar power, hydropower and tidal power. Technologies would improve and be more efficient and again, the world would use fewer sources of energy that cause pollution. This development can also be seen today, with many governments committing to proportions of their power needs coming from renewable resources.I, therefore, strongly agree with the statement that the changes from reducing reliance on fossil fuels will be positive. The only caveat is that society will need to have developed alternative sources of power rather soon, in order to avoid an energy crisis.";The notion that the end of the world's fossil fuel resources will be a positive development in society is a contentious issue. While I can see some benefits to this scenario, I largely disagree with the statement. Today's society overwhelmingly depends on products made from fossil fuels, and the sudden loss of these resources would undoubtedly lead to significant disruptions.On the one hand, the positive effect on transport and the reduction of the associated pollution will be significant. With the depletion of fossil fuels, there will be a shift towards cleaner, more sustainable modes of transportation, such as electric or hydrogen-powered vehicles. This, in turn, will lead to a substantial decrease in air pollution, causing respiratory problems and other health issues. For instance, cities like Paris and London have already seen a notable reduction in pollution levels since implementing policies to reduce fossil fuel emissions.On the other hand, the abrupt end of fossil fuel resources could lead to a type of transport crisis. If society can no longer provide the power to transport so many individuals, it may result in chaos and disorder. The lack of accessible transportation options could severely impact the economy, as the movement of goods and people would be severely restricted. Furthermore, many industries, such as aviation and logistics, would need to undergo significant transformations to adapt to the new energy landscape.In conclusion, while there are some positive aspects to the end of fossil fuel resources, I believe the negative consequences would outweigh the benefits. The world needs to gradually transition towards renewable energy sources, rather than experiencing a sudden and drastic change. This would enable societies to adapt and transform their infrastructure, industries, and transportation systems, minimizing the potential disruptions and ensuring a smoother transition to a more sustainable future.
1307;The fact that enormous sums are paid for pieces of art is not acceptable at a time when many people around the world live in poverty. Discuss this statement and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is true that pieces of art in today’s world can change hands for enormous sums. Works by artists such as Picasso, da Vinci and Rembrandt have been sold for millions of dollars. Recently, a Modigliani was sold to a billionaire for one hundred and seventy million dollars. It certainly seems obscene that such figures are spent when many people around the world live in poverty.The work of many charities would be transformed by the money generated by just one of these art sales and in turn, the lives of ordinary people in need would be transformed. Medicines, food and shelter amongst other things could easily be provided, saving lots of lives, many of which would be children. When the issue is looked at from this point of view, the art sales world certainly seems obscene.However, in my opinion, things are unlikely to change. Human greed is endemic and people who have the drive to earn that amount of money and who actually have access to these sums in cash are not often people who will part with their wealth. Lots of prosperous people support many charities, but it is unlikely that they would completely relinquish their access to the luxuries that accompany their lives. The works of art are also often seen as investments in themselves, to be held on to for a period of time and then resold at a profit.In conclusion, in an ideal world, the vast sums of money that are spent on fine and rare works of art would be better spent on helping those in need. In reality, however, this is unlikely to take place.;The statement that enormous sums paid for pieces of art are not acceptable when many people live in poverty is a contentious issue that sparks debate among art enthusiasts, economists, and social advocates. In my opinion, I agree that the vast amounts spent on art could be better utilized to alleviate poverty and improve the lives of those in need.Recently, a Modigliani was sold to a billionaire for a staggering $170 million. This amount is astronomical, especially when considering that it could be used to provide food, shelter, and education for thousands of people living in poverty. In an ideal world, the vast sums of money spent on fine and rare works of art would be better spent on helping those in need. The money could be used to fund initiatives that provide essential services, such as healthcare, sanitation, and education, to disadvantaged communities.Moreover, the art market is often driven by the wealthy elite, who purchase art as a status symbol or investment opportunity. This creates a cycle where art is seen as a luxury item, rather than a means of cultural expression or enrichment. Meanwhile, many people struggle to access basic necessities, let alone enjoy the beauty and cultural significance of art.However, it is also important to acknowledge the cultural and historical value of art. Art has the power to inspire, educate, and bring people together. In some cases, the sale of art can also generate revenue for museums, galleries, and artists, which can have a positive impact on the economy and society.In conclusion, while I believe that the vast sums spent on art could be better utilized to address poverty and inequality, I also recognize the importance of art in our society. Perhaps a balance can be struck, where a portion of the funds generated from art sales are allocated to support social causes, and the rest is used to preserve and promote the arts. Ultimately, it is up to individuals and societies to decide how to allocate their resources and prioritize their values.
1042;The first chart below gives information about the money spent by British parents on their children’s sports between 2008 and 2014. The second chart shows the number of children who participated in three sports in Britain over the same time period.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The line graph depicts the growth in average spending of British parents on children's sports from 2008 to 2014 while other graphs represent the popularity of sports among children and their participation from 2008 to 2014.Overall, the first graph was about the average monthly spend on children's sports which was at an exponential rate while in the second graph football was the most popular among children.To begin with the first graph, the average monthly spending of parents on children's sports was increasing at an enormous rate from 20 pounds in 2004 to approximately 33 pounds in 2014.Meanwhile, the second graph was about participation in three different sports where football was the most popular sport among children approximately 7.9 million in 2008 to roughly 8 million. swimming was growing at a certain rate while athletics was not so popular until 2010 after that there was a rush in participation in contrast to swimming but after the peak in 2012, there was a decrease in participation.;The spending habits of British parents on their children's sports and the participation rates of children in various sports have been tracked from 2008 to 2014. According to the first chart, a line graph depicts the growth in average spending of British parents on children's sports over this time period. The graph shows a steady increase in expenditure, indicating a growing investment by parents in their children's sporting activities.In contrast, the second graph illustrates the number of children participating in three different sports - football, tennis, and swimming. Among these sports, football was the most popular among children, with approximately 7.9 million participants in 2008, and roughly 8 million in 2014. This suggests a slight increase in participation rates for football over the six-year period. The data also implies that the growth in spending on sports is not necessarily matched by a corresponding increase in participation rates, particularly for sports other than football.It is notable that while spending on sports has increased, the participation rates have remained relatively stable, with football being the clear favourite among children. The data may suggest that the increased spending is being directed towards a smaller number of children who are participating in sports, or that the costs associated with participating in sports are rising. Overall, the charts provide insight into the spending habits of British parents and the sporting preferences of their children, highlighting the popularity of football and the need for further investment in other sports to encourage greater participation.
52;The first chart below shows the percentages of women and men in a country involved in some kinds of home tasks (cooking, cleaning, pet caring and repairing the house. The second chart shows the amount of time each gender spent on each task per day.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The two given charts illustrates the houshold work done by male and female of a nation. where firstly, the amount of work done by men and women is measured in percentage, and secondly, the average time devoted to do perform those work is calculated in minutes.Overall, it can be clearly seen that women performed more tasks in both the given terms then men, Although, men performed House repairs more than women.Firstly, women performed more household work than men, their main interest was in cooking and cleaning, where 80% of women performed Cooking and 60 percent cleaning, where men were 20% less in both the tasks. However, Tasks like pet care and house repairs male were higher in percentage then female.Secondly, Ladies performed the mentioned tasks more than men in regards of cooking they spent about 1 hour and 20 min and in cleaning approximately 68 minutes. However, they were equal in pet care, Although men spend close to 20 min minutes in house repair on average basis.;The two given charts illustrate the household work done by males and females of a nation, providing insight into the division of labor within the home. Overall, it can be clearly seen that women performed more tasks in both the given terms than men. In terms of percentages, the first chart shows that women are more involved in cooking, cleaning, and pet caring, with a significant majority of women participating in these activities. On the other hand, men are more involved in repairing the house, with a higher percentage of men taking on this task. The second chart, which shows the amount of time each gender spent on each task per day, further reinforces this trend. Women spend a substantial amount of time on cooking, cleaning, and pet caring, with a considerable amount of time dedicated to these activities. In contrast, men spend more time on repairing the house, reflecting their higher involvement in this task as seen in the first chart. However, it is worth noting that men's overall time spent on household tasks is significantly less than that of women. This suggests that while men may take the lead in certain tasks such as repairing the house, women still bear the brunt of household responsibilities. In conclusion, the charts demonstrate a clear disparity in the division of household labor between men and women, with women shouldering more of the burden. While men may have a greater involvement in specific tasks like house repairs, the overall trend indicates that women perform more tasks and dedicate more time to household work than men.
1188;The first chart below shows the results of a survey which sampled a cross-section of 100,000 people asking if they traveled abroad and why they traveled for the period 1994-98.The second chart shows their destinations over the same period.;The first chart indicates the results of a survey of people in the UK who traveled abroad and the reasons why they traveled from 1994 and 1998. In addition, there is another chart which areas they visited. Overall, it can be seen the main reason the UK residents visited abroad is for holiday, and the total number of people who traveled steadily increased every year, except for 1995. In addition, they visited Western Europe extraordinarily much higher than north America, and other areas.Initially, the total number of abroad visiter started at 22,072 in 1994. Somehow the total number decreased in 1995. It was specificalltry 21,610, but the number soared to 24,949 and reached a peak of 28,828 in 1996 and 1998 respectively. To break down the detail, the main purpose is for holidays. It is apparently much higher than other reasons and its percentage tend to be almost two-thirds every year. Aside from holidays, two reasons follow the second reason for business, the third reason for visits to friends and relatives. It is not so significant changes in percentage.Interestingly, , they almost visited western Europe from 1994 to 1998. The proportion of visitors is much higher than in north America and other areas.It seems to be around 90 percent of visitors went to western Europe.The proportion of visiter can be seen slightly increased, however, there is no significant change.;The results of a comprehensive survey conducted from 1994 to 1998, sampling a cross-section of 100,000 people, provide valuable insights into the travel habits of UK residents. The primary motivation for traveling abroad during this period was overwhelmingly for holiday purposes. This preference for leisure travel suggests that UK residents prioritize relaxation and exploration as key components of their overseas trips.Notably, the total number of people who traveled abroad demonstrated a steady increase each year, with a singular exception in 1995. This anomaly in 1995 notwithstanding, the overall trend indicates a growing inclination among UK residents to explore international destinations. The consistent rise in travel numbers underscores the importance of foreign travel in the lifestyles of UK residents during the late 1990s.An examination of the destinations preferred by UK travelers reveals a significant bias towards Western Europe. This region was extraordinarily more popular than North America and other areas, highlighting the proximity, cultural familiarity, and economic factors that likely influence travel decisions. The preference for Western Europe can be attributed to its geographical closeness, shared cultural heritage, and the ease of travel within the continent, making it an attractive and accessible destination for UK residents.In contrast, North America and other regions attracted substantially fewer visitors, suggesting that distance, cost, and possibly visa requirements may deter some travelers. Nonetheless, the survey's findings on travel destinations and motivations offer a compelling portrait of UK residents' travel preferences during the late 1990s, emphasizing the allure of Western Europe and the primacy of holiday travel. These insights can inform tourism strategies and travel industry developments tailored to meet the evolving demands and preferences of UK travelers.

714;The flow chart illustrates the consequence of deforestation. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features.You should write at least 150 words.;"The supplied illustration outlines the problems of cutting forests. As we can see, there are 4 main branches and each of them describes a certain issue, caused by deforestation.According to the first branch from the left, forest destruction can lead to the state when soil becomes hard and ""baked"". It occurs due to the fact that heavy logging equipment compresses the soil, as the first block of the chart says. Because soil becomes ""baked"", rain water starts to run off which causes flooding.If we look at the remaining branches, we can see that they all lead to the same conclusion - less biodiversity. But there are three different reasons for it. The first one is soil erosion. When we cut the trees, we have fewer tree roots to support the topsoil that eventually erodes.The second reason - increased risk of burning. It is followed by the destruction of waste wood. Then we have some micro-organisms such as pioneer species that move in and initiate degradation of vegetation. And it's all resulted in less biodiversity.The last branch starts with the fact that after cutting forests we have less plants to give back moisture to air, so less moisture enters the air. This triggers less precipitation, and so, increased droughts. Plants that unable to withstand hot and dry weather die and it ends with less biodiversity.To conclude everything, the main purpose of the presented flow chart was to demonstrate the severe damage that could be caused by deforestation.";The flow chart provides a visual representation of the devastating consequences of deforestation. At its core, the chart aims to demonstrate the severe damage that can be caused by cutting down forests, highlighting the catastrophic effects on the environment. The main features of the chart reveal that deforestation can lead to a multitude of problems, including soil erosion, increased risk of burning, and a significant decline in biodiversity.As we navigate through the flow chart, it becomes apparent that the removal of forests sets off a chain reaction, ultimately resulting in the degradation of ecosystems. Soil erosion occurs when tree roots are no longer present to hold the soil in place, while the increased risk of burning arises from the dry underbrush and debris left behind after deforestation. Most notably, however, the various branches of the flow chart all converge to the same alarming conclusion: a significant loss of biodiversity.The chart's emphasis on the loss of biodiversity serves as a stark reminder of the irreparable harm caused by deforestation. The removal of forests disrupts the delicate balance of ecosystems, leading to the extinction of countless species that rely on these habitats for survival. The flow chart effectively illustrates the far-reaching and devastating consequences of deforestation, underscoring the importance of preserving our planet's precious forests. Ultimately, the chart's message is clear: the preservation of forests is crucial to maintaining the health and diversity of our planet's ecosystems. By understanding the consequences of deforestation, as laid out in the flow chart, we can take steps to prevent further damage and work towards a more sustainable future.
78;The graph and chart below give information on the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures in degrees Celsius (°C) and the average number of days with rainfall each month for two Australian cities.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The line graph and chart below show data on the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures in degrees Celsius and the average number of days with rainfall each month, from January to December, for Brisbane and Canberra in Australia.Overall, both cities have similar tendencies throughout the entire period. Likewise, Canberra has lower temperatures than Brisbane during the whole year. In addition, Brisbane has a higher average number of days with rainfall than Canberra during most of the year.To start with, Canberra's maximum average daily temperatures have a significant decrease in tendency, from 27 degrees in January to only 11 degrees in July. In contrast, Brisbane's daily maximum temperatures present lower fluctuations from 28 degrees in January to just 21 degrees in July. Additionally, Brisbane reaches its highest maximum average daily temperature in February at 30 degrees, whilst Canberra reaches its lowest minimum average daily temperature in June and July at 2 degrees. Furthermore, the average number of days with rainfall decreases moderately during the winter season in Brisbane, from 14 days in February to 7 days in June, July and August. However, this is the opposite tendency in the average number of days with rainfall in Canberra which slightly increases from 7 days in February to 10 days in June, July and August.To sum up, Canberra has rainy and cold winters, whilst Brisbane has rainy and warm summers.;The provided graph and chart offer a comparative analysis of the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as the average number of days with rainfall, for two major Australian cities: Canberra and Brisbane. A notable trend observed from the data is that Canberra generally experiences lower temperatures than Brisbane throughout most of the year. This suggests that Canberra has a cooler climate overall, which could be attributed to its geographical location and elevation.In contrast, Brisbane exhibits a higher average number of days with rainfall compared to Canberra. This indicates that Brisbane has a more humid and rainy climate, particularly during certain periods of the year. Furthermore, the data reveals that Brisbane reaches its highest maximum average daily temperature in February, at 30 degrees Celsius. This peak temperature, combined with the higher rainfall, points to a characteristic warm and rainy summer season in Brisbane.On the other hand, Canberra's climate is distinguished by rainy and cold winters. The lower temperatures and significant rainfall during the winter months suggest that Canberra experiences a more pronounced winter season compared to Brisbane. This contrast in seasonal experiences between the two cities is likely due to their different latitudes and elevations, with Canberra being located in the southeastern part of the country at a higher elevation.In summary, the temperature and rainfall data for Canberra and Brisbane highlight distinct climatic differences between the two cities. While Brisbane is characterized by warm and rainy summers, Canberra is marked by cold and rainy winters. These differences are crucial for understanding the geographical and climatic variations across different regions of Australia.
920;The graph and pie chart below give information on in-house training courses in a large financial company.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The charts illustrated are a representation of some information regarding in-house training courses in a reputable financial company.In the grand scheme of things, more time was spent on technical aspects of the courses than on the other aspects within the year. Quite conversely people spent less time learning about health and safety. Most of the managers and secretaries thought the courses were important for the job but a handful thought it was a waste of valuable time.55 hours in the year were devoted to training courses. Of these, exactly 30 hours were spent on technical skills, 15 on Career Development, 10 on Inter personal skills and 5 hours on Health and safety.The opinion of Managers and Secretaries was also sought as shown in the next chart. Here we see that majority of both managers and secretaries believe the courses are important for the job; about 84% of Secretaries and just around 76% of managers. It makes sense then that only few of these groups of people think the courses are a waste of time (almost 10% for secretaries and just above 10% for managers).Exactly 50% of managers believe the courses are good for net working while a smaller percentage of secretaries, about 43%, are of the same opinion. A good number still believe the courses provide a good excuse for a change - about 66% for Managers and just shy of 65% for Secretaries.";The graph and pie chart provided offer insight into the in-house training courses conducted within a large financial company. Over the course of the year, a total of 55 hours were allocated to these training sessions, indicating a significant investment in employee development. Upon examining the distribution of these hours, it becomes clear that technical skills were prioritized, accounting for exactly 30 hours of the total training time. This emphasis suggests that the company recognizes the importance of maintaining and enhancing the technical proficiency of its staff to stay competitive in the financial sector. Career development was the second most focused area, with 15 hours dedicated to it, highlighting the company's interest in the growth and advancement of its employees.In contrast, interpersonal skills and health and safety received relatively less attention, with 10 and 5 hours allocated to these areas, respectively. While these aspects are crucial for a harmonious and safe working environment, the allocation of time suggests that the company views them as secondary to technical and career development skills.Feedback from managers and secretaries indicates a generally positive perception of the training courses, with most considering them important for job performance. However, a minority view the courses as an unnecessary use of valuable time, suggesting some skepticism about their effectiveness or relevance. Overall, the data portrays a company committed to employee training and development, particularly in technical areas, but with room for improvement in engaging all staff in the value of these initiatives.
922;The graph below compares figures for the production and consumption of energy in the US from 1950 to 2000. It also predicts figures for 2025.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The line chart gives the comparision figure about how energy produced and consumed by the U.S.A. in a 50 year period starting in 1950 along with a 25 year projection. There is two lines, one representing the American energy's consumption and the other about the energy production in the U.S.A between 1950 and 2000 and the forecast figure from 2001 to 2025. Those were measured by British thermal Units.By and large, the consumption and production of energy in the U.S.A. grew strongly over the period from 35 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to approximately 90 quadrillion Btu in 2000 and from 25 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to 65 quadrillion Btu in 2000 respectively. There are a prediction in energry consumption reaching 135 quadrillion Btu in 2025 and 75 quadrillion Btu in energy production.The first detail to note is that the consumption and production of engery rose steadily over the period. They were significant fluctuation at the start of the period but had risen to around 50 quadrillion Btu in 1975. This was followed by the another fluctuation between 1975 and 2000 and recovered by nearly 90 quadrillion Btu in energy consumption in 2000 and 65 quadrillion Btu in energy production.The amount of energy consumption in the United States is projected to remain much higher and will be increased as much as energy production overall. Amercian willl spend 75 quadrillion Btu in energy consumption more than in energy production in the prediction of 2025.;The graph illustrating the production and consumption of energy in the US from 1950 to 2000, along with projections for 2025, reveals significant trends in the country's energy landscape. Over the five-decade period, both the consumption and production of energy in the U.S.A. grew strongly, from 35 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to approximately 90 quadrillion in 2000. This substantial increase underscores the rapid industrialization and technological advancements that characterized the latter half of the 20th century.A notable aspect of the graph is the consistent gap between energy production and consumption, indicating that the US has relied on external sources to meet its energy demands. The consumption of energy has consistently surpassed production, highlighting the country's dependence on imported energy sources. This disparity is projected to continue, with the amount of energy consumption in the United States remaining much higher than production levels.Moreover, the projections for 2025 suggest that energy consumption will continue to increase, albeit at a slower pace compared to the previous decades. Conversely, energy production is also expected to rise, although not at a rate sufficient to bridge the gap with consumption. This implies that the US will continue to rely on imports to meet its energy needs, underscoring the importance of developing strategies to enhance energy independence and security.In conclusion, the graph presents a comprehensive overview of the evolution of energy production and consumption in the US, from 1950 to 2000, and offers insights into future trends. The persistent gap between production and consumption, coupled with the projected increase in energy demand, underscores the need for sustained efforts to enhance energy production, improve efficiency, and explore alternative energy sources to mitigate dependence on external energy supplies.
722;The graph below presents the employment patterns in the USA between 1930 and 2010.Summarise the information by selecting and report in the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The line graph below illustrates the labor force patterns in the USA from 1930 to 2010. According to the graph, farming, fishing and foresting had singled out all the other types of labors and appeared to be the major source of employment in from 1930 to 1960, which had an emplyment rate up to almost 80, but as the US society became modernized, the employment rate in the those traditional types of work had dropped dramatically since 1970, and reached almost the lowest point of zero in 2010, whereas the other three types of labor-industrial, Sales and Office and Technical shared an average growth from 1970 to 2010.The modernization of US society and the developments of urban areas had changed the labor market, as labors in the technical, industrial and service fields were in high demands. In 1930, the employment rates of these industries remained under 20, but they started to increase in 1970. Industrial labor had the most rapid growth, which rose to almost 40 in 2010. It was followed by technical work, which also reached an approximate point of 30 in 2010. Salse and Office came into the third place, which slightly increased to 20 in the end of 2000s. Nevertheless, the of ""other services"" was the category in exception, as it remained unchanged since 1970 and maintained the average point of 10.";The line graph illustrating labor force patterns in the USA from 1930 to 2010 reveals significant shifts in employment trends over the decades. Notably, the period between 1930 and 1960 saw farming, fishing, and forestry emerge as the major sources of employment, outpacing other types of labor. This dominance is indicative of the agricultural backbone of the US economy during the earlier part of the 20th century.However, as the US society underwent modernization, there was a marked decline in the employment rates in these traditional sectors. Starting from 1970, the employment in farming, fishing, and forestry began to drop dramatically. This decline reflects the structural changes in the US economy, with a shift towards service-oriented and industrial sectors. The reduction in employment in these areas is also a testament to technological advancements and automation that reduced the need for manual labor in these fields.By 2010, the employment rate in farming, fishing, and forestry had plummeted to almost zero, according to the graph. This drastic reduction underscores the significant transformation of the US labor force over the eight decades. The shift away from traditional labor-intensive industries towards more modern and technologically driven sectors signifies the evolution of the US economy. Comparatively, while farming, fishing, and forestry were once the pillars of employment, their decline highlights the country's progression towards a more diversified and industrialized economy. The data presented in the graph provides a clear visual representation of how employment patterns in the USA have undergone substantial changes, reflecting broader economic and societal shifts.
568;The graph below shows changes in global food and oil prices between 2000 and 2011.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The graph indicates food price and oil price both how to change in the worldwide scale during 2000 to 2011. Their fluctuations of price were similar.In 2000, food price was 90 points, and oil price was $30. Then, both prices had slowly increased till 2007. Suddenly, food price and oil price both had a drastic jump in 2008. Separately, food index price reached to 220 points，meanwhile oil price was beyond $220 where was the highest price in the historical record. Strangely, both prices dropped sharply in 2009, food price returned to 140 points same as the previous price in 2007, and oil price returned to less $40 same as the previous price in 2005. However, since 2009, food price and oil price both performed a shaking tendency. Finally, food price reached to the new highest points, 140 in 2011, and oil price was weaker than food price, which was $100 in 2011.Global food price and oil price are the two dominant index to expose the change of the global financial market. They interact with each other.;The graph illustrates the fluctuations in global food and oil prices between 2000 and 2011. A notable trend observed in the graph is the similar pattern of price changes for both food and oil on a worldwide scale during this period. In 2000, the global food price index was at 90 points, while the oil price was approximately $30 per barrel. Over the next few years, both prices experienced moderate fluctuations. However, a significant turning point occurred in 2008, when both food and oil prices underwent a drastic jump. The food price index skyrocketed to 220 points, representing a substantial increase of 130 points from its initial value in 2000. Similarly, the oil price surged beyond $140 per barrel, with the highest record reaching $220 per barrel in 2008.This sudden and sharp increase in prices can be attributed to various factors, including supply and demand imbalances, geopolitical tensions, and speculation in the markets. The simultaneous rise in food and oil prices suggests a strong correlation between the two, potentially due to the dependence of food production and transportation on oil. The similar fluctuations in price movements imply that the global food and oil markets are interconnected, and changes in one market can have a ripple effect on the other.Overall, the graph highlights the significant changes in global food and oil prices between 2000 and 2011, with a notable peak in 2008. The similar patterns of price changes and the drastic jump in 2008 underscore the interconnectedness of the food and oil markets, emphasizing the need for careful monitoring and management of these essential resources.
898;The graph below shows how money was spent on different forms of entertainment over a five year period.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The provided barr chart depicts the proportion of money spent on several entertainment categories in three different locations from 1995 to 2000.Overall, television in the US was the entertainment sector with the highest income in 2000, whereas, cinema and video received the lowest income over the same 5 years period in the three locations.The barr chart shows that television had the highest amount of money in 2000 reaching 100 out of 257. In contrast, in 1995, the US television had just above 50 out of 184. Similarly, television in Europe had the same income of the latter in 2000.On the other hand, cinema and video categories were the sectors with the lowest income of the three locations. In Asia, for example, cinema and television represent just a small fraction of the income. Similar patterns can be seen in Europe and the US.;The graph illustrates the expenditure on various forms of entertainment over a five-year period, from 1995 to 2000. A notable trend is the significant increase in spending on television, which reached its peak in 2000 with an expenditure of 100 out of 257. This represents a substantial growth from 1995, when the US television sector had just above 50 out of 184.In contrast, the cinema and video categories were the sectors with the lowest income throughout the period. These two sectors consistently trailed behind television in terms of expenditure, indicating a preference for in-home entertainment over outdoor cinematic experiences. The disparity in spending between television and these categories suggests that consumers prioritized the convenience and accessibility of television over the immersive experience of cinema and video.Comparing the expenditure on television between 1995 and 2000, it is evident that there was a significant surge in spending, with an increase of nearly 50 units. This rise may be attributed to advancements in television technology, increased programming options, or shifts in consumer behavior. The consistent low expenditure on cinema and video, on the other hand, implies that these sectors faced challenges in attracting and retaining audiences, possibly due to the growing appeal of in-home entertainment.Overall, the graph highlights the dominance of television in the entertainment sector, with a notable increase in expenditure over the five-year period. The cinema and video categories, however, struggled to gain traction, underscoring the need for these sectors to adapt and innovate to remain competitive in the market.
852;The graph below shows information on employment rates across 6 countries in 1995 and 2005.Summarise the information by choosing and describe the main idea, and make comparisons where appropriate.;The bar chart sheds light on how employment rates of each gender changed from 1995 to 2005 in six nations: Australia, Switzerland, Iceland, Britain, New Zealand and the United States.Overall, there are mainly two trends suggested by this diagram. First, the employment rates of males were higher than those of females in both 1995 and 2005 across all six countries. Second, this period witnessed an increase in the employment rates of both genders in all countries.As shown in this graph, the large gender gap of employment took place in Iceland, Australia and New Zealand where the difference of employment percentage between males and females reached approximately 30% in both 1995 and 2005. In the other countries, the difference was between 10% and 15%.It is also apparent that an increase of around 10%-15% in employment proportions appeared in each gender across all nations, especially in Australia where the percentage of employed men rose from about 56% to 70% while that of employed women went up from nearly 26% to 38%.;The bar chart provides a comprehensive overview of employment rates across six countries, namely Australia, Switzerland, Iceland, Britain, New Zealand, and the United States, for the years 1995 and 2005. The main idea that emerges from this graph is the significant variation in employment rates between genders in these nations over the decade. A notable observation is the substantial gender gap in employment rates that persisted in Australia, New Zealand, and Iceland. In both 1995 and 2005, the difference in employment rates between males and females in these countries was approximately 30%, indicating a consistent and sizable disparity. This suggests that despite the passage of time, these countries struggled to address and reduce the gender employment gap.In contrast, the graph implies that other countries, such as Switzerland, Britain, and the United States, had relatively smaller gender gaps in employment rates during the same period. Although the exact figures for these countries are not provided, the overall trend suggests a more balanced employment rate between genders compared to Australia, New Zealand, and Iceland.The persistence of such a large gender gap in employment rates in certain countries is a matter of concern, as it indicates underlying structural or societal issues that hinder equal employment opportunities. The comparison across these six countries highlights the need for targeted policies and initiatives to address and reduce gender disparities in the workforce. Overall, the graph sheds light on the importance of monitoring and comparing employment trends to understand the progress made towards achieving gender equality in the workplace.
1018;The graph below shows the amounts of waste produced by three companies over a period of 15 years.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The line graph gives us informations about how much tonnes of waste is created by three companies between the year 2000 and 2015. It can be observed that majority of the companies reduced their waste in this period and become more eco-friendly.Overall, while company A nd B were reducing their waste, company C provided more waste from 2000 to 2015. Also, company B recorded significant drop from 2005 to 2015.Taking a closer look at the graph, it can be seen that company A created the most waste in the beginning. They recorded 12 tonnes of wastes in the year 2000, however, they reduced their waste consistently in the following years and produced less than 9 tonnes in 2015. Unfortunetly, company C increased their waste records in this period. While they produced little over 3 tonnes of waste in 2000, they rose this record regularly to over 9 tonnes in 2015.On the other hand, company B increased their waste from 2000 to 2005 with reaching over 9 tonnes in 2005 from around 8 tonnes in 2000. However, there is a major drop between 2005 and 2015. They decreased their waste from over 9 tonnes in 2005 to 3 tonnes in 2015.;The graph illustrates the amounts of waste produced by three companies, A, B, and C, over a 15-year period from 2000 to 2015. A notable trend observed in the graph is that the majority of the companies have reduced their waste production, indicating a shift towards more eco-friendly practices.However, a striking exception is Company C, which consistently increased its waste production throughout the period. In contrast, Companies A and B demonstrated a significant reduction in waste output, with Company B being the most notable. From 2005 to 2015, Company B recorded a substantial drop in waste production, suggesting a concerted effort to adopt sustainable practices and minimize its environmental footprint.The reduction in waste production by Companies A and B is a positive trend, indicating their commitment to environmental responsibility. On the other hand, Company C's increasing waste production raises concerns about its environmental sustainability and the need for the company to reassess its practices and implement measures to reduce its waste output.Overall, the graph suggests that while most companies are moving towards more eco-friendly practices, there is still a need for improvement, particularly for Company C. The significant drop in waste production by Company B from 2005 to 2015 serves as a model for other companies to follow, demonstrating that with concerted effort, it is possible to reduce waste production and become more environmentally sustainable. As companies continue to prioritize environmental responsibility, it is likely that waste production will continue to decrease, contributing to a more sustainable future.
1238;The graph below shows the number of enquiries received by the Tourist Information Office in one city over a six-month period in 2011.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram given illustrates the number of enquiries received by Tourist Information Office from January to June, a period of six months. Overall enquiries received in persons have shown an increasing pattern in all phases, while the data received by letter or email have shown a declining trend and information received by telephone shows a fluctuating trend.In the month of January, the higheset value in which method in which enquiries were received by telephone with a value of nearly 900 and the lowest amount is 450 and that is in person.In sharp contrast to this, information received by in person and by letter shows the values of 1900 and 1600 respectively, while the information received by either letters or emails habe shown a continuous declining trend from January to May from 750 to 350 approximately and it has remained constant from May to June at the amount of 300.;The graph illustrating the number of enquiries received by the Tourist Information Office in a city over a six-month period in 2011 reveals significant trends in the way people sought information. From January to June, the data shows a notable distinction in the modes of enquiry, particularly between personal visits and written or electronic communications.Overall, the number of enquiries received in person has demonstrated a consistent increasing pattern across all phases of the period. This upward trend suggests that more people are opting to visit the office directly, potentially indicating a preference for face-to-face interaction and immediate assistance. This could be due to the personalized experience and detailed information that can be provided through in-person interactions.In contrast, the data received by letter or email paints a different picture. There has been a discernible decline in the number of enquiries made through these channels over the six months. This declining trend may reflect a shift in consumer behavior, where individuals are moving away from traditional and digital correspondence towards more direct and interactive methods of seeking information. The decline could also be influenced by the immediacy and efficiency of in-person visits, which might be perceived as more convenient in comparison to waiting for responses via mail or email.The comparison between these two modes of enquiry highlights a significant shift in how people are choosing to interact with the Tourist Information Office. As personal visits continue to rise, it suggests that the office should prepare to accommodate more direct interactions, potentially by increasing staff numbers or extending operational hours. Conversely, the decline in written and electronic enquiries may lead to a reevaluation of the office's digital presence and communication strategies to better meet the evolving needs and preferences of potential tourists.
14;The graph below shows the number of overseas visitors to three different areas in a European country between 1987 and 2007Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The graph below illustrates the amount of overseas visitors to three different places ( the coast, the mountains, the lakes ) in a European country between the period 1987 to 2007. The unit used in the graph is thousandsOverall, the lakes had the lowest amount of visitors in the graph in 1987 by 10 thousand visitors in oppose the coast had the most number of visitors in the graph in 2007 by slightly over 70 thousand visitors. The mountains had the lowest amount of visitors in all the times visitors combined while the coast and the lakes were really close to each other in the overall amount of vistors nearly the same amount of visitors.In the period from 1987 to 1992 The coast had the highest number of visitors by approximately 40 thousand visitors while the lakes had the lowest number of visitors by nearly 10 thousand visitors and the mountains were the middle between them by slightly over 20 thousand visitors.In the period from 1992 to 1997 the coast also was the highest number of visitors by around 40 thousand visitors in meantime the lakes was lower than the mountains it was above 15 by littile and the mountains were above 25 but the lakes suprisingly rocketed and achived the mountains even went more by 30 thousand approximately.;The graph below illustrates the amount of overseas visitors to three different places, namely the coast, the mountains, and the lakes, in a European country between the period 1987 to 2007. This visual representation provides a clear insight into the tourism trends of these areas over two decades.Overall, the coast had the most number of visitors in the graph, peaking in 2007 with slightly over 70 thousand visitors. This suggests that the coastal area is the most popular destination among overseas visitors, likely due to its attractive beaches, scenic views, and vibrant seaside towns. In contrast, the mountains and the lakes received significantly fewer visitors, with the mountains having the lowest number of visitors throughout the period.A comparison of the three areas reveals that while the coast experienced a steady increase in visitor numbers, the mountains and the lakes showed more fluctuating trends. The lakes, in particular, experienced a decline in visitor numbers from 1997 to 2002, before showing a slight recovery. The mountains, on the other hand, maintained a relatively stable number of visitors, although at a much lower level than the coast.The significant difference in visitor numbers between the coast and the other two areas may be attributed to various factors, including the diversity of attractions, accessibility, and marketing efforts. The coast's consistent popularity suggests that it has been successful in attracting and retaining visitors, while the mountains and the lakes may need to enhance their tourism infrastructure and promotion to increase their appeal to overseas visitors.
972;The graph below shows the number of university graduates in Canada from 1992 to 2007.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The following line graph provides details about the number of university graduates in Canada over a fifteen-year period from 1992, dividing into two genders.Overall, it can be inferred from the graph that there were upward trends in the number of university graduates of the two sexes. The first thing to note is that from the beginning in 1992, female university graduates outnumbered the number of graduates of the opposite sex. In spite of the noticeable increase in the number of male graduates, the distance still became larger in the year 2006. In 2006, the distance between the two sectors climbed from 30000 in 1992 to more than 50000.Although there was a fluctuation in the number of female graduates, there was an enormous rise from approximately 100000 in 1992 to almost 150000 in 2006. For the opposite gender, we can see more fluctuations though it was still an upward trend. The number of male university graduates grew from 70000 to around 95000 over a period of fifteen years from 1992 to 2006.;The graph illustrating the number of university graduates in Canada from 1992 to 2007 reveals notable trends and comparisons between the two genders. One of the most striking features of the graph is that female university graduates consistently outnumbered their male counterparts from the beginning in 1992. This disparity is not only present throughout the period but also widens over time.In 1992, the difference between the number of female and male graduates was approximately 30,000. However, by 2006, this gap had significantly increased to more than 50,000. This widening gap underscores the increasing dominance of females in university graduation rates over the period. The trend for female graduates shows a steady and pronounced increase, indicating a consistent growth in the number of women pursuing and completing higher education.In contrast, the trend for male graduates, while still upward, exhibits more fluctuations. Despite these fluctuations, the overall trajectory for male graduates is positive, indicating an increase in the number of males graduating from university. However, the growth rate for males is outpaced by that of females, leading to an expanding gap between the two genders.The comparison between the two trends highlights significant shifts in gender dynamics within Canadian universities. The consistent lead of female graduates and the widening gap between the sexes suggest changes in societal attitudes, educational policies, or economic factors that may be encouraging more women to pursue higher education. Overall, the graph presents a compelling picture of gender differences in university graduation rates in Canada from 1992 to 2007, with females leading the way and males following with a less steady but still upward trend.

Interestingly, the percentage of people choosing to go to the cinemas on Fridays remained stable at 30% through the whole three years.In 2003, only one in ten people decided to go to the cinemas on Mondays, as opposed to the two fifths of people choosing to go on Saturdays and the just under a third of people opting for Sundays. In 2005, the trend experienced a downward trend during weekdays but eventually rose significantly to just under a half and just over a third during weekends, outracing the rate of 2003 and 2007. Lastly, in 2007 the rate continued to present considerable fluctuations, hitting a high point of approximately two fifths on Saturdays.;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of people going to cinemas in one European country on different days of the week over a three-year period from 2003 to 2007. A notable trend is the varying attendance patterns throughout the week. In 2003, only one in ten people decided to go to the cinemas on Mondays, as opposed to the two fifths of people choosing to go on Saturdays. This significant disparity highlights the preference for weekend cinema visits.Comparing the weekdays, it is evident that Monday is the least popular day for cinema visits, with a mere 10% attendance rate in 2003. In contrast, Saturday emerges as the most popular day, with an impressive 40% of people opting to go to the cinema. This trend is consistent with typical leisure patterns, where weekends are often reserved for entertainment and relaxation.Over the three-year period, the graph shows a general stability in the attendance patterns, with minor fluctuations. The peak attendance on Saturdays remains relatively constant, while weekdays witness slight variations. Sundays also attract a sizable audience, with around 30% of people visiting cinemas. The chart suggests that the cinema-going habit is more entrenched on weekends, with a substantial drop in attendance on weekdays, particularly Mondays.In conclusion, the bar chart reveals distinct patterns in cinema attendance across different days of the week in one European country between 2003 and 2007. The significant disparity between weekend and weekday attendance rates underscores the popularity of cinema visits as a leisure activity on Saturdays and Sundays. The relatively low attendance on Mondays and other weekdays reinforces the notion that cinema-going is a preferred weekend activity.

Meanwhile USA expected to have the lowest rate .A closer examination of the graph , it's seem that population in Japan was at low point in 1940 with 5% and remain relatively stable till 2020 .Afterwards the trend shows increase slightly to 10% in 2025However, speculation of dramatic growth in trend after 2025 to reach 27% by 2040. Meanwhile in Sweden the data started 7% in 1940 .Athough the trend went up and down till 2020 with 15%.Nevertheless, expected to raise considerably to 25% in 2040.Likewise, in USA the data shows fluctuations starting with 10% in 1940 and expected to end by 23 % in 2040 .;The line chart illustrates the proportion of the population aged 65 and over in three countries: Japan, USA, and Sweden, from 1940 to 2040. Overall, the figure reveals that Japan is expected to have the highest percentage of elderly population among the three nations.In 1940, the proportions of elderly population in Japan, USA, and Sweden were relatively low, ranging from 4-7%. However, over the years, the percentage of elderly population in Japan has been steadily increasing, and it is projected to continue this trend until 2040. By 2040, Japan's elderly population is expected to account for approximately 30% of its total population, making it the country with the highest proportion of elderly citizens among the three.In comparison, the USA and Sweden have also experienced an increase in their elderly population, but at a slower rate than Japan. The USA's elderly population is projected to reach around 20% by 2040, while Sweden's is expected to be slightly lower, at around 18%. The significant difference in the proportion of elderly population between Japan and the other two countries suggests that Japan will face unique demographic challenges in the coming decades.The data suggests that Japan will have to adapt to a rapidly aging population, which may lead to increased strain on the country's pension and healthcare systems. In contrast, the USA and Sweden will also have to address the needs of their aging populations, but to a lesser extent than Japan. Overall, the graph highlights the importance of understanding demographic trends and their potential impact on societies, economies, and healthcare systems.

That said it's clear those times had the highest value due to the people going to their work and people leaving.On the other hand, at 10.00 am the number of passengers decreased dramatically to 180. In addition from 12.00 pm to 14.00 pm, the number of passengers slightly increased from 280 to 310. There was a sharp decrease from 14.00 pm to 16.00 pm in the number of passengers where it reached 100. Also, another sudden drop from 18.00 pm to 20.00 pm in the number of passengers occurred where was recorded 120.Furthermore, at 6.00 am and 16.00 pm the number of passengers recorded almost the same value of 100. It can be concluded people's busy time during the day can affect the number of passengers that take the underground station.;The line graph illustrates the Underground Station passenger numbers in London, recorded between 6.00 am and 22.00 pm. The data reveals distinct patterns and fluctuations in passenger numbers throughout the day. One of the most notable features of the graph is the peak in passenger numbers at 8.00 am, where the highest value of 400 was recorded. This suggests that the morning rush hour is the busiest time for Underground Stations in London, with a large number of commuters travelling to work or school. However, this peak is short-lived, as passenger numbers decrease dramatically to 180 by 10.00 am. This sharp decline indicates that the morning rush hour is relatively brief, and passenger numbers return to more moderate levels soon after.Another significant decrease in passenger numbers occurs between 14.00 pm and 16.00 pm, where the numbers plummet to 100. This suggests that the late afternoon period is a relatively quiet time for Underground Stations in London, possibly due to a lull in commuter activity between the morning and evening rush hours.Overall, the graph highlights the dynamic nature of Underground Station passenger numbers in London, with distinct peaks and troughs throughout the day. The comparison between the peak morning hour and the quieter afternoon period reveals a significant variation in passenger numbers, underscoring the importance of understanding these patterns for effective transportation planning and management.
396;The graphs below show the enrolments of overseas students and local students in Australian universities over a ten year period.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The two graphs compare the development of the students' enrollments for both groups of local and overseas students in Australian universities between the year of 2001 and 2010. Considering the overall trend of both of the groups for the commencing category, the trend seems to be positive with overseas students, while being quite stagnated within the local students.The total number of enrollments associates with a relatively different development compared to the commencing category. For the overseas students, the trend is strongly possively correlated among the whole period, while for the local students, the positive trend has stopped at year 2007 at the rate of 600000 enrolments per year.For the commencing category, the trend has been over the years relatively positive for the overseas students, except between 2009 and 2010. On the other side, the number of enrolments of local students has slightly degraded in the same period.To summarize, the accumulation of the number of enrolments of both local and overseas students is different and utilizes different trends in the same periods. Neverthless, for the total number of students the difference is not enormous, but rather stagnating for the local students starting at 2007.;The graphs provided illustrate the enrolment trends of overseas and local students in Australian universities from 2001 to 2010. A comparative analysis of the two graphs reveals distinct patterns in the development of student enrolments for both groups.For the commencing category, the trend appears to be positive with overseas students, indicating a steady increase in enrolments over the decade. In contrast, the local students' commencing enrolments remain relatively stagnant, with minimal fluctuations throughout the period. This suggests that Australian universities have become increasingly attractive to international students, while failing to inspire significant growth in local student numbers.In terms of overall enrolments, the graphs show a noticeable disparity between the two groups. Overseas student enrolments exhibit a consistent upward trend, with a significant surge in the latter half of the decade. Conversely, the local student enrolments remain relatively flat, with only minor increases observed. This divergence implies that Australian universities have become more reliant on international students to drive growth in enrolments, while domestic student numbers have plateaued.The comparison between the two graphs highlights the growing importance of overseas students to the Australian higher education sector. The stagnation of local student enrolments, coupled with the rapid growth of overseas student numbers, underscores the need for universities to reassess their strategies for attracting and retaining domestic students. Overall, the graphs suggest that Australian universities have become increasingly globalized, with a rising dependence on international students to fuel enrolment growth.
912;The graphs below show the number of men and women in full and part-time employment in Australia between 1973 and 1993.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;"The graphs compare the participation of full-time and part-time workers in Australia as differenciated by gender and age group in the period betweeen 1973 and 1993.Overall, it is clearly seen that the number of full-time workers for both male and female experienced a slight decline as part-time work become more favourable among these employees. Moreover, despite their gender, there are more people in the age group of 15-19 years old employed for part-time jobs.Based on the age group, it is illustrated that the number of full-time and part-time male workers between 25-49 years old has no significant difference. However, the lines indicated that for female employees the number of people working full-time and part-time were more fluctuated, meaning that age group influenced their employment status. For example, the female employees at the age group of 15-19 years old working full-time was accounted for almost reaching to 50 per cent in 1973, but stepping down to 20 per cent in 1993; while part-time workers at the same age group has a higher number 1993 compared to those who worked in 1973 by around 32 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively.";The graphs provided offer a comparative analysis of the participation of full-time and part-time workers in Australia, differentiated by gender, over the period between 1973 and 1993. Upon examination, it becomes apparent that the number of full-time workers, for both males and females, experienced a slight decline over the two decades.Notably, the graphs illustrate a consistent trend where the number of individuals in full-time employment decreased marginally for both genders. This decline suggests a shift in the employment landscape, potentially due to changes in economic conditions, industry requirements, or personal preferences among the workforce.Despite the gender differences, the graphs reveal a commonality in the employment patterns of young individuals. Specifically, there are more people in the age group of 15-19 years old employed in part-time jobs, regardless of gender. This trend indicates that younger workers, likely students or those in the early stages of their careers, prefer or are more suited to part-time employment. This could be due to the need to balance work with education or other responsibilities, highlighting the flexibility that part-time jobs offer to this age group.The comparison of full-time and part-time employment across different genders and age groups between 1973 and 1993 provides valuable insights into the evolving nature of work in Australia. The slight decline in full-time workers and the prevalence of part-time employment among young individuals underscore the changing dynamics of the workforce. These trends may reflect broader societal, economic, and educational shifts, emphasizing the need for ongoing analysis of employment patterns to understand and address the evolving needs of the Australian workforce.
1056;The graphs below show the numbers of male and female workers in 1975 and 1995 in several employment sectors of the Republic of Freedonia.Write a report for a university teacher describing the information shown.;The chart gives information about the number of female and male employees divided by six different sectors (manufacturing, communications, finance/banking, wholesale & retail trade, non-defence public sector and defence public sector) in the year 1975. Overall, male employees outraced female in manufacturing, finance/banking and defence public sector. While in communications, wholesales & retail trade and non-defence public sector, female workers were higher in the year 1975.In manufacturing, number of male employees was slightly higher than female workers by about 280 thousands. Turning to the finance/banking sector, male employees was three-fold more than female workers. Moreover, men work in defence public sector also made up the biggest part of the total number of employees by approximately 190 thousands.The number of female workers exceeded male employees in three sectors. First, the communications sector, which male workers were less than 50 thousands, while the number of female workers were around 240 thousands. Second, the wholesale & retail trade, the female employees were over 450 thousands but the male workers were lower than 100 thousands. Last sector is the non-defence public sector, the total employees were the highest among others, with about 640 thousands female workers and 200 thousands male workers only.;The provided graphs offer a comparative analysis of the workforce demographics in the Republic of Freedonia, specifically focusing on the numbers of male and female workers across various employment sectors in 1975 and 1995. A thorough examination of these graphs reveals distinct patterns and disparities in the distribution of male and female workers across different sectors.In the sectors of manufacturing, finance/banking, and defence public sector, male employees significantly outraced their female counterparts in both 1975 and 1995. This dominance of male workers in these traditionally male-dominated fields suggests a historical gender imbalance that persisted over the two decades. The manufacturing sector, in particular, showed a considerable gap between male and female workers, indicating a strong male presence in this industry.On the other hand, the graphs indicate that in 1975, female workers outnumbered their male counterparts in the communications, wholesales & retail trade, and non-defence public sector. This trend is noteworthy as it suggests areas where women had a stronger presence in the workforce. The non-defence public sector, for example, showed a higher number of female employees, which could imply a more inclusive or female-friendly work environment in this sector compared to the defence public sector.These observations underscore the existence of gender-based disparities in the workforce distribution across different sectors in Freedonia during the period of 1975 to 1995. While male workers dominated certain traditional sectors, female workers had a significant presence in others, particularly in service-oriented and public sectors. Understanding these patterns is crucial for policymakers and employers aiming to promote gender equality and diversity in the workplace. Further analysis would be necessary to explore the reasons behind these trends and to assess how they may have evolved beyond 1995.
1216;The graphs below show the types of music albums purchased by people in Britain according to sex and age.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The table charts give information about the type of music album that people of different sex and age have bought in Britain. Rock Music is generally the top sellers. The class of people between 25 and 34 years old buy more albums than the others.Rock music is the the more sold type, whereas classical music is the less purchased. However, there is a divergence concerning the type of listeners of the two types of music. Indeed, Rock Music (the most listened type) is particularly listened by people who are aged between 16-35, they exceed the 30%. Instead, Classical Music is particularly interesting for adults which are aged over 45. Indeed, the more than 20% of people of this age buy classical music. By contrast, the yungers, between 16 and 24 years old, who listened to classical music are almost 0%. Pop music, is the second more purchased type. It is purchased by all the types of people even if no one of the class exceed 30% of buyers.There is a difference that concerns the age of people and their musical interests. Nonetheless, people beteen 25 and 35 year old are those who by the most and different types of music. They purchase around 30% of Rock Music's albums, even if the type they buy the most is Rock Music. They are also interested in buying Classical Music.

638;The line graph below shows the oil production and consumption in China between 1982 and 2006.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;This line graph indicates oil production and consumption per day in China from 1982 to 2006. Clearly, the consumption doubled its production in 2006.To begin with, oil consumption started the millions of oil barrels per day for almost two, and remained the same by 1990. But, its consumption suddenly surged to about 3.7 million in 1994. Then, the number of consumption skyrocketed from 1998 and reached a peak of more than 6 million in 2006. Consequently, the consumption tripled, compared with 1982.Secondly, the production also commenced the millions of oil barrels per day around two, and increased its production to three million in 1986. In contrast, its production leveled off by 1994. Afterward, the production slightly kept going up and resulted in 3.5 million in 2006. As a result, the oil production increased, compared with 1982. But it is clear that the pace of production is quite slower than consumption.;The line graph illustrates the trends in oil production and consumption in China from 1982 to 2006. A notable feature of the graph is the stable oil consumption pattern observed from 1982 to 1990, where consumption remained steady at around 1 million barrels per day for almost two decades, with minimal fluctuations. However, a significant shift occurred in 1994, when oil consumption suddenly surged to approximately 3.7 million barrels per day. This marked the beginning of a rapid increase in consumption, which continued unabated from 1998 onwards. The consumption skyrocketed, reaching a peak of more than 6 million barrels per day by 2006. Consequently, the oil consumption in China tripled compared to the levels in 1982, indicating a massive growth in the country's demand for oil over the two-and-a-half decades. This exponential growth in oil consumption can be attributed to various factors, including rapid industrialization, urbanization, and an increase in the number of vehicles on the road. The comparison between the initial and final years of the graph highlights the enormous increase in oil consumption, underscoring the country's rising dependence on oil to fuel its economic growth. Overall, the line graph presents a clear picture of China's escalating oil consumption from 1982 to 2006, with the most significant growth occurring in the latter half of the period.
120;The map and chart below show the information for the global willingness to eat insect products and the current price for certain food available on the market place.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The map and chart gives information on each country's preference to try insect products and the price for food on the market.On the map, the countries with high willingness to try insect products are marked yellow to green, while low tolerance countries are marked red to orange. Over half of Mexico, Peru, and Thailand's populations are willing to try insect products, making them the top 3 countries. On the contrary, Japan had an extremely low percentage in 21%.It is evident on the chart that glutinous rice is the the cheapest food product with $0.82/kg, followed by rice, chicken, pork, buffalo, beef, in that respective order. The chart indicates that the most expensive food is weaver ant, with $10.65/kg. There is an apparent trend in the price of insects, they are less affordable compared to other sources of protein. However, water bugs and house crickets are exceptions to that particular trend. It is also worth noting that male water bugs are more expensive than the female water bugs.;The provided map and chart offer valuable insights into the global willingness to consume insect products and the current market prices of various food items. A notable trend emerges from the map, indicating that over half of the populations in Mexico, Peru, and Thailand are willing to try insect products. This suggests a significant openness towards entomophagy, the practice of eating insects, in these countries. Such willingness could be leveraged to promote sustainable and environmentally friendly food sources, given the lower ecological footprint of insect farming compared to traditional livestock.The chart, on the other hand, presents a comprehensive overview of the current market prices of different food products. Glutinous rice stands out as the cheapest option, priced at $0.82/kg, closely followed by regular rice, and then a range of meats including chicken, pork, buffalo, and beef. This pricing suggests that staple grains like rice remain highly affordable and accessible, which is crucial for food security, especially in regions where these items are dietary staples.In stark contrast, the weaver ant emerges as the most expensive food product, with a price tag of $10.65/kg. This significant price disparity highlights the niche market and potentially high demand or challenging supply chain associated with weaver ants as a food source. The premium pricing of weaver ants could be due to various factors, including the difficulty in harvesting, cultural demand, or the nutritional and culinary value attributed to them.In conclusion, the map and chart collectively paint a picture of global food preferences and economics. They underscore the potential for insect-based food products to find a market, particularly in certain regions, and highlight the vast differences in food pricing globally. These insights are valuable for policymakers, entrepreneurs, and environmental advocates looking to promote sustainable food practices and understand the complex dynamics of the global food market. Further research into the reasons behind these trends and their implications for food security and sustainability would be beneficial.
882;The map below shows three possible locations for a leisure centre. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;This map describes the possible areas for a leisure centre. It is clear from the graph that the three selected areas have different characterestics which make each of them as unique place.According to what is shown, place A is very close to some industries and that make it unsuitable to be a leisure center. Moreover, this area is not healthy due to the pollution that comes from the industries' smok.For the second area (B), this location is close to the some buildings where people live and that is good choice. However, the only negative of this place is that it will be noise. However, location C is the beast due to its location. It is located faraway from any kind of pollution. People can breath fresh air and enjoy the grean areas.To summarize, we could say that, location C has several positives that make it the best choice for a leisure centre.;The proposed map outlines three potential locations for a leisure centre, each with its distinct advantages and drawbacks. Location A is situated in close proximity to industrial areas, which renders it an unsuitable choice due to the inherent pollution and noise associated with industrial activities. This proximity would likely detract from the leisure centre's intended purpose of providing a peaceful and healthy environment for its patrons.In contrast, Location B is positioned near residential buildings, which could be beneficial as it would be easily accessible to the local community. However, the potential noise and disruption caused by the leisure centre's activities might be a concern for the nearby residents. Location C, on the other hand, stands out as the most desirable option. It is strategically located far away from any sources of pollution, ensuring a clean and serene atmosphere conducive to leisure and recreational activities. The distance from industrial and residential areas also minimizes potential disruptions, making it an ideal setting for a leisure centre. Overall, while each location has its pros and cons, Location C's unique positioning makes it the most suitable choice for a leisure centre, offering an optimal blend of accessibility, tranquility, and environmental quality. Its distant location from pollution sources ensures a healthy and enjoyable experience for users, making it the preferred option among the three.
938;The maps below show the development of a small fishing village and its surrounding area into a large European tourist resort.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The map illustrates on how a fishing village with a population of 12,000 people in 1974 has been converted to a European tourist resort in 2004 which can accommodate 80,000 residents and 50,000 tourist beds.Except for the fishing village, all other places were modified.It is apparent from the map that there has been a huge loss of flora and fauna on this restructure. Dense woodland was replaced with hotels and golf course. Areas allocated for sheep and goats and olives cultivation were converted into tourist shops and farmland for harvesting fruits and vegetables to serve tourists at hotels.A portion of village, harbour and place were boats were stationed has been relocated to accommodate tourists to have a sea view.A pathway has been created from top of the mountain to the beach to facilitate tourist travel different destinations.Consequently, there has been a huge loss in habitat and probably a shift in fishermen jobs. For survival, fishermen would have taken up jobs like working in tourist shops, serving tourists at restaurant and guiding tourists.;The transformation of a small fishing village into a large European tourist resort is a significant development that has occurred over a period of thirty years, from 1974 to 2004. Initially, the fishing village had a population of 12,000 people, indicating a modest and close-knit community. However, by 2004, the village had undergone a radical metamorphosis, emerging as a thriving tourist resort.One of the most striking aspects of this transformation is the extensive modification of the surrounding area. Unlike the fishing village, which has retained its original character, the rest of the region has undergone substantial changes. New infrastructure, such as hotels, roads, and amenities, have been constructed to cater to the influx of tourists. This development has inevitably led to a significant loss of natural habitats and ecosystems, resulting in a substantial decline in flora and fauna.A comparison of the two time periods reveals a stark contrast between the pristine natural environment of 1974 and the heavily developed landscape of 2004. The expansion of the resort has come at a considerable environmental cost, with large areas of natural beauty being sacrificed for the sake of tourism. While the development has likely brought economic benefits to the region, it is essential to acknowledge the devastating impact on the local biodiversity.In conclusion, the transformation of the small fishing village into a large European tourist resort has been a complex and multifaceted process. While it has undoubtedly brought economic growth and new opportunities to the region, it is crucial to recognize the significant environmental costs associated with this development. As the resort continues to evolve, it is essential to prioritize sustainability and environmental conservation to mitigate the loss of flora and fauna that has already occurred.
825;The movement of people from the countryside into the cities is happening in many parts of the world, resulting in the problems, especially in cities.What are the causes of this movement, and how can it be reversedGive reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;People move from the countryside into the cities. It occurs in many parts of the world, causing problems, especially in urban areas. This essay will elaborate on the causes of this movement, and the way it can be reversed from my personal standpoint.Centralization has caused this movement. All the major institutions and facilities are in the cities. Thus, people in rural areas have to sacrifice considerable time and effort to travel to urban centres. As it is also costly, people choose to move into the cities so that traveling does not consume their time. For instance, one-fifth of the total population in Korea currently lives in Seoul, the capital city of Korea. In fact, all the educational, medical, and entertainment facilities are centralized in urban areas. It can be reserved by implementing decentralization. The government has to disperse the location of the major institutions and diverse types of facilities into different districts so that people living in remote areas can also benefit.Furthermore, people in remote areas want to earn opportunities for better employment or education. As a city is a point where technologies, investments ,and professions gather, there is a better opportunity for people to get employed or educated in a improved quality. Therefore, people choose to leave the countryside. Thereby, the government can initiate the policies in which firms earn benefit when they move their head office to districts. If the firms commence moving, it will produce a great amount of employment.Conclusively, not only the government but also the businesses and institutions have to co-operate to combat problems resulting from a surge in the movement of people from the countryside into the cities.;The movement of people from the countryside into the cities is a widespread phenomenon occurring in many parts of the world. This mass migration has resulted in numerous problems, particularly in urban areas, where resources and infrastructure are often overwhelmed. One of the primary causes of this movement is centralization, where major institutions and facilities are concentrated in cities, leaving rural areas with limited opportunities.As a result, people in remote areas are drawn to cities in search of better employment prospects, education, and healthcare. The lure of urban centers is strong, with promises of higher paying jobs, improved living standards, and access to quality education and medical facilities. For instance, many rural towns lack universities, hospitals, and other essential services, forcing residents to migrate to cities to pursue their goals. This exodus of talent and labor from rural areas to cities has led to brain drain, reduced economic activity, and strained resources in urban centers.To reverse this trend, governments and policymakers must invest in rural development, ensuring that essential services and institutions are accessible and of comparable quality to those in cities. This can include initiatives such as building rural universities, hospitals, and vocational training centers. Additionally, incentivizing businesses to set up operations in rural areas through tax breaks, subsidies, or other benefits can help create jobs and stimulate local economies. By decentralizing opportunities and facilities, it is possible to reduce the allure of cities and encourage people to remain in or return to their rural communities, thereby mitigating the problems associated with urban overcrowding and promoting more balanced regional development.
1299;The number of advertisements for charities on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. What is causing this? Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It indeed appears true that the frequency with which advertisements for charities appear both on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. There can be various explanations for this and it can be seen in both a positive and negative light.One explanation for the increase in the number of charity advertisements is that the charities themselves are becoming more aggressive in their marketing. This can also be seen in the common strategy nowadays to encourage a monthly donation, rather than a one-off donation. The increased marketing is apparent too in the increased numbers of ‘street salespeople’, who stop passersby and try to get them to commit to this monthly payment.A second reason for the increase could also be that there have been more charities started and the number of advertisements would therefore increase and become more noticeable. If these charities are all legitimate, this would mean that more help will be getting to causes that need it. The increase in charities could also be explained by a possible increase of humanitarian awareness. People might be now adopting different ideologies that take into account people in less advantageous positions.If the number of advertisements for charities has risen due to the fact that there has been a positive shift in people’s compassionate principles, this surely has to be seen as an optimistic development. If it is due to the fact that governments have been cutting back, it could be seen as a pessimistic development. In addition, if there are more charities asking for more money, this will inevitably mean that the amount of money donated will have to be more thinly spread, which would be a negative development.There could be several reasons for why there are more charity advertisements today. Whatever the reasons, as long as any money is helping people in disadvantageous positions, it must be seen as a positive development.;The proliferation of charity advertisements on television and the Internet has become a ubiquitous phenomenon in recent years. This surge in charitable marketing can be attributed to several factors. One primary reason is that charities are becoming more aggressive in their marketing strategies. In an effort to stand out in a crowded field, charities are adopting more assertive tactics to garner attention and solicit donations. This shift towards more aggressive marketing is a response to the increasing competition for limited donor resources.Another significant factor contributing to the rise in charity advertisements is the sheer increase in the number of charities being established. As more charities are founded, the overall number of advertisements would naturally increase, leading to a more saturated market. This growth in the charitable sector can be seen as a positive development, as it indicates a broader range of causes being addressed and a greater diversity of organizations working towards positive change.The increase in charities could also be explained by a possible increase in humanitarian awareness. In an era where global connectivity is at an all-time high, thanks to the Internet and social media, people are more informed than ever about global issues and crises. This heightened awareness has led to an outpouring of support for various causes, resulting in the establishment of more charities and, subsequently, more advertisements. For instance, the response to natural disasters and humanitarian crises has shown that people are willing to donate when they are made aware of the need. Overall, the increase in charity advertisements is a positive development, reflecting a growing awareness of global issues and a willingness to address them. While the aggressiveness of some marketing strategies may be off-putting to some, the end goal of supporting worthy causes and improving lives outweighs the potential drawbacks. As the charitable sector continues to evolve, it will be important for organizations to strike a balance between effective marketing and respectful donor engagement.

654;The pie chart gives information on UAE government spending in 2000. The total budget was AED 315 billion.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The pie chart provides data about UAE regime expenditures in ten different sectors namely:law&order,Education,Industry agriculture &employment,Defence,other expenditure,Debt interest,housing the heritage& environment,Social security,Transport,and health&personal social services.while the total budget was AED315 billion for year 2000.In general, the visual indicates that most money went for social security,in contrast to transport that costs least expense on the UAE government from the total budget.To start with,the UAE government provided AED 315 billion as total budget for year 2000. The lion shear was for social security to record the highest value of expenses at AED 100 billion on the UAE government,followed by health and personal social services that AED 53 billion was spent by UAE authorities.Meanwhile, education costs was AED 38 billion from the total budget of year 2000.Interestingly,UAE government spent on other expenditure and debt interest only AED 23 billion for each from 2000's total budget.Later, defence ,Law and order,and housing the heritage and environment AED22 billion,AED17 billion,and AED 15 billion went for each respectively.Finally, the two least value was AED 13 billion,and AED 9 billion from the total budget to be paid for Industry agriculture &employment ,and transport accordingly.;The pie chart provides a comprehensive overview of the UAE government's spending in the year 2000, with a total budget of AED 315 billion. The chart categorizes the expenditures into ten distinct sectors, including law and order, education, industry, agriculture and employment, defence, other expenditure, debt interest, housing and heritage and environment, social security, transport, and health and personal social services.Upon analyzing the chart, it becomes evident that social security received the largest allocation of funds, indicating the government's prioritization of welfare and public services. This suggests that the UAE regime recognized the importance of ensuring the well-being and stability of its citizens, and therefore, invested heavily in this sector.In contrast, the transport sector received the least amount of funding, implying that it was not a primary concern for the government at that time. This could be due to the fact that the UAE's infrastructure was still developing, and other sectors, such as social security, took precedence.The distribution of funds across the various sectors highlights the government's strategic allocation of resources, with a focus on social welfare, education, and defence. The significant allocation to social security underscores the government's commitment to providing for its citizens' basic needs, while the relatively low allocation to transport suggests that this sector was not deemed a priority at the time. Overall, the pie chart provides valuable insights into the UAE government's spending patterns in 2000, allowing for a deeper understanding of the regime's priorities and resource allocation strategies.
1278;The pie charts below give data on the spending and consumption of resources by countries of the world and how the population is distributed.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;Following three pie chats depict the distribution of population globally compared to spending and consumption of resources by countries .Overall , we can obseve in the first figure that world spends more in food and transport .Whilst in second chart summerize population in the world with Asia has bigger share .However third figure notes that USA and Europe consume main resources of the world .By analysing following data , its evident that food have the bigger share of spending money including 24% of total spending . Whilst transport comes next including 18% , housing and cloths consume 12% and 6% respectively . Nevertheless other aspects of life consume 40% . Meanwhile second pie chart about world population . Although, Asia froms 57% of population , highest percentage , Europe and America form 28% distributed equally and Africa 10 % . Interestingly USA and Europe consume 60% of world resources and rest of the world consumes 40% . Clearly that USA and Europe constitue 28% of world population but they consume the main resources of the world.;The three pie charts provided offer a comprehensive overview of the global distribution of population, consumption, and spending patterns across different countries. Overall, these charts highlight significant disparities in how resources are allocated and consumed worldwide.The first pie chart reveals the distribution of global spending, with a notable emphasis on food and transport, which collectively account for the majority of expenditures. Specifically, it is evident that a larger portion of global spending is dedicated to food, followed closely by transport. This indicates that these two sectors are the primary areas where countries allocate their resources, likely due to the fundamental needs they address—sustenance and mobility.In comparison, the second pie chart, which illustrates the consumption of resources, presents a slightly different picture. Here, the consumption patterns show a significant allocation towards housing and energy, with food and transport also featuring prominently. This similarity in allocation towards food and transport across spending and consumption patterns underscores their universal importance.The third pie chart, which depicts the global distribution of population, presents an interesting contrast when compared to the spending and consumption patterns. Regions with large populations, such as Asia, understandably have a significant portion of the global population. However, when this is compared to the spending and consumption patterns, it becomes apparent that there is not a direct correlation between population size and the allocation of resources. For instance, regions with smaller population percentages may still have substantial spending and consumption in areas like food and transport, indicating a complex relationship between population distribution and resource allocation.In conclusion, the pie charts highlight the complex interplay between global population distribution, spending, and consumption of resources. The emphasis on food and transport in spending patterns, alongside the notable consumption of housing and energy, suggests that basic needs and infrastructural requirements are prioritized globally. Understanding these patterns is crucial for addressing global challenges such as resource management, sustainability, and equitable distribution of resources.
546;The pie charts below show how dangerous waste products are dealt with in three countries.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;"The pie charts illustrate the dealing with dangerous waste products in the Republic of Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. It can be clearly seen that the last country is the only one where people do not use the recycling method; instead, they prefer chemical treatment and dumping at sea.According to the data, the underground method (82%) coloured in red in the United Kingdom pie chart prevails, compared to Sweden (55%) and the Republic of Korea (22%), coloured in green. On the other hand, people in the Republic of Korea prefer to use the recycling method 69%) the most, while those who live in Sweden do not use it so often (25%).The United Kingdom has identical points at 8% for chemical treatment and dumping at sea methods. However, the lowest point (2%) has the incineration method in this country, while people in the Republic of Korea and Sweden destroy waste by fire more often, 9% and 20%, respectively.";The pie charts provided offer a comparative analysis of how dangerous waste products are managed in three countries: the Republic of Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. These charts give insight into the different strategies each nation employs to handle hazardous waste, highlighting both similarities and stark differences in their approaches.In the Republic of Korea and Sweden, the preferred methods for dealing with dangerous waste products include recycling, incineration, and landfilling, with a significant emphasis on recycling. This suggests that these countries prioritize environmental sustainability and the reduction of waste through reuse and recycling. The inclusion of recycling as a primary method indicates a proactive approach towards minimizing environmental impact and conserving natural resources.In contrast, the United Kingdom stands out as the only country among the three where recycling is not a preferred method for managing dangerous waste. Instead, the UK relies heavily on chemical treatment and, notably, dumping at sea. This approach is significantly different from the other two countries and may raise concerns regarding environmental impact, particularly the potential for marine pollution from sea dumping. The lack of recycling as an option in the UK's waste management strategy is noteworthy and may indicate a need for policy adjustment to align more closely with international best practices that prioritize recycling and reuse.The comparison of these three countries' methods for dealing with dangerous waste highlights the diversity of strategies employed globally. It underscores the importance of considering the environmental consequences of waste management choices and the potential benefits of prioritizing recycling and sustainable disposal methods. As the world moves towards more sustainable and environmentally conscious practices, the approaches taken by the Republic of Korea and Sweden may serve as models for other nations, such as the United Kingdom, to reconsider and potentially adapt their waste management policies.
596;The pie charts below show the average household expenditures in a country in 1950 and 2010.;The provided pie chart illustrates information about the spending rates in homes on different type of serevices in 6 dacades from 1950 to 2010.Overall,as it can be clearly seen that the housing expenditures rates is the highest in 1950 where,the health care rates was the least in that particular year.Where as in the 2010 the most expenditure was on food and the least expenditures was the transportation.As persented in the pie chart,the the majority of the people spend most of their money on housing with aprroximately 72.1percent that number dramaticly decreaced in 2010 to 22.0 percent .In contrast with the food sector where it started with only 11,2 percent in 1950 and rose up by almost 20% reaching to its peak od 34.0% in 2010.In terms, of other sectors including health care and education. the propotion of spending in the health care sector was relaetivly smaller with only 2.4 percent that number was doubled to 4.5.% in 2010.although there was no noticable changes in the education sector.Finally,the most significant change was definitely in transportation since people back in the 1950s where not interested in buying cars the percentage was as little as 3.3 percent that number dramaticky rose up to 14.0% in 2010.while their was obvious changes in other serevices the spending rates grow from 4.4% in 1950 to remarkable jump to 19.2 percent in the year 2010.;The provided pie charts illustrate the average household expenditures in a country, offering a comparative analysis of spending rates on different types of services over a period of six decades, from 1950 to 2010. A glance at the charts reveals significant shifts in expenditure patterns, reflecting changing priorities and economic conditions over the years.In 1950, the housing expenditure rate stands out as the highest, indicating that a substantial portion of household income was allocated towards shelter and related expenses. On the contrary, healthcare expenditures were the least, suggesting that either healthcare costs were relatively low or it was not a priority for households at that time. This distribution highlights the basic needs of survival and shelter being the foremost concern for households in 1950.Fast-forwarding to 2010, the expenditure patterns have undergone a notable transformation. The most significant expenditure in this year is on food, signifying an increased allocation of household income towards sustenance. This could be due to various factors, including inflation, changes in dietary habits, or an increase in the cost of living. Conversely, the least expenditure is observed in transportation, which might imply advancements in transportation technology making it more affordable, or perhaps a shift towards more economical modes of transport.Overall, the pie charts underscore the dynamic nature of household expenditures, influenced by factors such as economic growth, technological advancements, and changing societal needs. The comparison between 1950 and 2010 serves as a testament to how priorities and necessities evolve over time, reflecting broader societal and economic developments. Understanding these shifts is crucial for policymakers and economists to predict future trends and make informed decisions regarding resource allocation and budget planning.
678;The pie charts below show the percentage of housing owned and rented in the UK in 1991 and 2007.Summarize the information by describing the main features of the charts and making comparisons where appropriate.;The diagrams illustrate the proportions of four different kinds of housing in the UK between 1991 and 2007, namely home owner, social renting, private renting as well as social housing.Overall, it is clear that the number of homes in UK recorded a considerable increase from 1991 to 2007, at 22 million homes compared to 27 million homes. Furthermore, more UK residents owened their home while less people chose social renting and social housing during the period from 1991 to 2007.Looking into the details, ,home owner is the top choice for UK residents which comprised 60% in 1991. Then, it considerably rose to 70% after 16 years. Next came to the social renting which recorded an dramatic decrease from 1991 to 2007, at 23% and 17% in turn. The percentage of social housing also significantly plunged from 6% to 2%. The percentage of private renting remain unchanged at 11% over the period.;The pie charts provided offer a comprehensive overview of the housing landscape in the UK, specifically highlighting the proportions of different types of housing ownership and rental arrangements between 1991 and 2007. These diagrams illustrate the proportions of four different kinds of housing in the UK during these two years, giving insight into the shifts in housing preferences and availability over time.One of the most notable observations from the charts is the considerable increase in the total number of homes in the UK, which rose to 22 million by 2007. This increase suggests a significant expansion in housing availability, which could be attributed to various factors including government policies, economic growth, and changes in demographic needs.A comparison of the two time periods reveals a marked shift in the preferences of the population regarding housing ownership and rental options. It is evident that more people opted for home ownership in 2007 compared to 1991. This trend could be due to factors such as easier access to mortgage facilities, government incentives for first-time buyers, and an overall increase in disposable income among the population.Conversely, there was a noticeable decline in the proportion of individuals and families opting for social renting and living in social housing. This decrease might reflect changes in government housing policies, reduced funding for social housing projects, or an increase in the cost of social housing, making it less accessible to those who rely on it.In conclusion, the pie charts illustrate a dynamic housing market in the UK between 1991 and 2007, characterized by an increase in total housing stock, a preference for home ownership, and a decline in social renting and housing. These trends underscore the evolving nature of housing needs and preferences in the UK, influenced by a combination of economic, social, and policy factors.
24;The pie charts below show the percentage of time working adults spent on different activities in a particular country in 1958 and 2008. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevantYou should write at least 150 words.;The pie charts indicate how the proportion of time changes in spending on different activities from working adults in a country in the years 1958 and 2008.Overall, while it can be seen that working was the most important event occupied a majority of the percentage of time either 1958 or 2008, the amount of time on sleeping decreased obviously in 2008.First, most of the researched events occupied more time than in the past. Working is one of the events presenting the most serious situation and it took 33% in 1958, increasing to 42% in 2008. Moreover, adult workers in this country were more likely to travel to work, presenting 8% in 2008 from only 2% in 1958. Besides working, citizens tended to relax at home spending 13% of the time on this event, and in which people take 8% of their time in 1958.However, the harder working, the less time was spent in rest. Working adults spent 25% of sleep in 2008, while they spent 32% in 1958. Also, they reduce the time spending in going out with their friends or families, spending only 6% in 1958 from 19% in 1958.;The pie charts provided offer a fascinating insight into the allocation of time by working adults in a particular country, highlighting significant shifts in priorities between 1958 and 2008. One of the most striking aspects of the comparison between these two years is the pronounced change in the proportion of time dedicated to different activities, underscoring evolving lifestyles and potentially, the impact of technological advancements and societal expectations.A notable trend observed is the inverse relationship between work hours and rest time. It appears that the harder working adults were, the less time they allocated to rest, suggesting a significant dedication to their professional lives, possibly at the expense of personal downtime. This is reinforced by the data on sleep patterns, where working adults spent 25% of their time sleeping in 2008, a considerable decrease from the 32% recorded in 1958. This reduction in sleep time may indicate longer working hours or increased commitments outside of work, reflecting a society that values productivity and efficiency.Besides their professional commitments, citizens tended to spend a significant amount of time relaxing at home, with 13% of their time allocated to this activity. This preference for home-based leisure activities could be due to various factors, including the rise of home entertainment options, increased comfort, or a desire to unwind in a familiar environment after lengthy work periods. The decrease in sleep time and the allocation of time to relaxation at home suggest a complex interplay between work, rest, and leisure, with working adults navigating the demands of professional life while seeking to maintain a work-life balance.The comparison between 1958 and 2008 also hints at broader societal changes, including potential increases in work demands, changes in leisure activities, and shifting values regarding work and personal time. Overall, the pie charts paint a picture of working adults in 2008 as being more dedicated to their work and possibly having less time for personal activities, highlighting the need for strategies to achieve a better balance between professional and personal life to maintain well-being and productivity.

152;The plans below show a student accommodation buildings 2010 and now.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant;The maps illustrate the changes of an architecture which was used for students’ accommodation in the year 2010 and now.In 2010, apparently, there was one main entrance in the southwest corner of the building where students could easily access. The livingroom was situated on the north side of the architecture where students could have a rest. Opposite to the livingroom, there was a bath room on the centre of the floor where students could use to take a shower. A kitchen was established be adjacent to the bathroom in the east side of the plan where children could cook by themselves. It is noticeable that there are three student-bedrooms laying on the southeast, northeast and northwest corners of the building respectively. Besides, the architecture was surrounded by gardens in the north and south sides.Now, after the modifications, an extra en-suits room has been added in the southeast corner be in the adjoining place of one of the student-bedrooms, taking the place of the hallway in 2010. It is worth noticing that the kitchen is also be used as a social area now. More striking is that the livingroom has been reconstructed into a student-bedroom. It must be pointed out that the building has been expanded and a new student-bedroom has been situated on the northwest corner of the architecture. In addition, the garden which was located on the south side of the construction has been modified into a car parking where individuals can park their cars.In conclusion, now the number of student-bedrooms has increased and the function of the student accommodation building has become manifold;The provided maps illustrate the transformations of a student accommodation building from 2010 to the present day. A comparison of the two layouts reveals significant alterations aimed at enhancing the living conditions and facilities for the residents.In 2010, the building had a single main entrance located in the southwest corner, facilitating easy access for students. This straightforward design suggested a focus on simplicity and functionality. Notably, the original layout incorporated a living room, presumably intended as a communal space for students to socialize and relax.However, the modified blueprint shows a marked departure from the earlier design. One of the most striking changes is the addition of an extra en-suite room in the southeast corner, adjacent to one of the student bedrooms. This adjustment indicates a shift towards providing more private bathroom facilities, potentially enhancing the comfort and convenience of the students.Moreover, the living room, which was once a communal hub, has been repurposed as a student bedroom. This transformation suggests an effort to increase the accommodation capacity of the building, possibly in response to growing demand for student housing. The conversion of communal space into residential area may, however, reduce the opportunities for social interaction among students, which is an important aspect of student life.In conclusion, the modifications to the student accommodation building from 2010 to the present reflect a dual focus on increasing capacity and improving facilities. While these changes may enhance the individual living experiences of the students, they also underscore the importance of balancing privacy with communal spaces in student accommodation designs.
998;The plans below show a student room for two people and a student room for one person at an Australian university.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The layout illustrates the structure of student rooms for one and two people respectively in an university in Australia.Overall, It can be obeserved that cost for one person in a double occupancy room is lower than expense in single room. the plan compares the amenities in both the rooms.Firstly the cost of one person is dollar 175/week in double room as compare to dollar 200 in single occupancy. The double occupancy room seems more cost effective and euipped with shared amenities.There is an evident difference in the size and facilities in both the room. The remarkable differences is table and chair.which are missing in the single room. Double occuapncy room comes additional cupboard and bookshelf as well. The width of the room is 4 meters and bigger as compare to single room which is 2.5 meters in dimesnions. Kitchen facilities are mostly similar in both the rooms.;The layout of student rooms at an Australian university reveals distinct differences in structure and amenities between rooms designed for one person and those for two people. A notable aspect is the cost, with a single occupancy room costing $200 per week, whereas a double room, which accommodates two students, costs $175 per week for each student. This pricing indicates that sharing a room can be a more economical option for students.In terms of layout and size, the single occupancy room is designed to provide a more spacious and private living environment, tailored to meet the needs of one individual. It includes a larger bed, more extensive storage space, and possibly more luxurious furnishings compared to the double room. On the other hand, the double room is optimized for shared living, with two beds, shared storage, and communal study and living areas. This shared space is designed to foster a sense of community and camaraderie among roommates.The difference in facilities between the two types of rooms is also evident. Single occupancy rooms may offer more personalized amenities, such as an en-suite bathroom or a private study area, which can enhance the overall living experience. In contrast, double rooms rely on shared facilities, including bathrooms and kitchenettes, which, although convenient, may lack the privacy and exclusivity of single occupancy rooms.In conclusion, the university's student rooms for one and two people reflect a thoughtful approach to catering to different student preferences and budgets. While the single occupancy room offers privacy and luxury at a premium price, the double room provides an affordable and socially engaging living environment. Ultimately, the choice between these options depends on individual priorities regarding space, cost, and lifestyle preferences.

1372;The proportion of older people is increasing, what problems will this cause and what solutions can be suggested?;In many countries the proportion of older people is steadily increasing. What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.It is true that nowadays people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences to this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.As people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. In other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. A second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. Finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent vital healthcare, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of senior citizens.In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.This essay covers the task requirements, however some problems of aging population get only a brief mention. The linking of sentences in the second body paragraph is somewhat ‘mechanical’ and could have been improved. Information sequencing and organisation in paragraphs are done well. The range of vocabulary and the fluency of its use, as well as lack of errors are impressive. Overall, this is a good example of how to get Band 8 without writing a very long essay.;The proportion of older people is steadily increasing in many countries, posing significant challenges for individuals and society as a whole. This demographic shift will lead to a multitude of problems, primarily in the economic and healthcare sectors. As the population ages, the workforce will shrink, resulting in a decrease in tax revenues and an increase in the burden on pension and social security systems. Furthermore, the demand for healthcare services will rise, placing a strain on already overburdened healthcare systems.Additionally, older individuals may face social isolation, decreased mobility, and cognitive decline, affecting their overall quality of life. To mitigate these issues, several measures can be taken. Governments can implement policies to encourage older adults to remain in the workforce, such as offering flexible retirement plans and training programs to enhance their skills. This will not only contribute to the economy but also help to reduce the burden on pension systems.Moreover, investing in healthcare infrastructure and promoting healthy aging practices, such as regular exercise and balanced diets, can help to reduce the incidence of age-related diseases. Community-based initiatives, as such adult day-care programs and transportation services, can also help to combat social isolation and improve mobility among older adults. Ultimately, a multi-faceted approach is required to address the challenges posed by an aging population. By adopting proactive strategies, societies can work towards creating a supportive environment for older individuals, ensuring their well-being and contributions are valued, while also mitigating the economic and social impacts of an aging demographic.

1228;The table below shows social and economic indicators for four countries in 1994, according to United Nations statistics.Describe the information shown below in your own words. What implications do the indicators have for the countries?;The table compares the performance of social and economic aspects for Canada, Japan, Peru and Zaire in 1995. In general, Japan and Canada outperformed in four social and economic indicators their counterparts, Peru and Zaire.To be precise, regarding the economic indicators, people in Japan earned the highest annual income among the four countries, with US$ 15,760, and Canadian people earned the second most annual income with US$11,100. People in Peru and Zaire earned a lower annual income, almost 98 times less than people in Canada and Japan.With regard to the social indicators, people in Canada and Japan showed a longer life expectancy at birth, both of which had a life expectancy of more than 75 years old, whereas the life expectancy in Peru and Zaire was much lower, with only around 50 years old. The adult literacy rate in Canada and Japan saw the same percentage, both at 99%. While 68% of adults in Peru had literacy, the adult literacy rate in Zaire was only 34%, two times less than Peru and almost three times lower than Canada and Japan. With respect to the daily calorie supply, Canada had the highest calorie supply per person, with a number of 3326, while Japan, Peru, and Zaire received a lower calorie supply with aroud 2000 only.;The table provided by the United Nations statistics compares the social and economic performance of four countries: Canada, Japan, Peru, and Zaire in 1994. A closer examination of the data reveals significant disparities among these nations. In terms of life expectancy at birth, Canada and Japan demonstrated superior performance, with both countries boasting an average life expectancy of over 75 years. This suggests a high standard of living and access to quality healthcare in these countries.Regarding social indicators, Japan and Canada again showed exceptional performance, with 99% of their populations having access to necessary social services. This implies a well-developed infrastructure and social support system in these nations. On the other hand, Peru and Zaire lagged behind in this aspect. The adult literacy rate in Peru was 68%, indicating a notable portion of the population lacking basic reading and writing skills. The situation was even more dire in Zaire, where a mere 34% of adults were literate. This stark contrast highlights the significant challenges faced by these countries in terms of education and human development.The implications of these indicators are profound for the countries in question. Canada and Japan, with their high life expectancy and excellent social indicators, are likely to have a more productive and skilled workforce, contributing to their economic prosperity. In contrast, Peru and Zaire face significant development challenges, with low literacy rates and limited access to social services hindering their economic growth and social progress. Addressing these disparities is essential for these countries to improve the overall well-being and quality of life of their citizens.

The measurement used per basic food is calories per person per day.If we analyse rice consumption first, we can observe that Cambodia leads the consumption rate, followed by far by Egypt, Mexico and Poland. However over wheat the country with highest consumption rate is Egypt closely followed by Poland. Regarding maize the country with a higher consumption rate is Mexico, followed by Egypt, nevertheless the maize consumption in Mexico almost doubles Egipt´s consumption.To summarise the consumption of rice in Cambodia is almost 300% over the rice consumption in Egypt, and very far away from the consumption in Mexico and Poland. The wheat consumption in Egypt is high, and is over a 30% beyond Poland´s consumption. To finalize the consumption of maize is high in Mexico being almost 100% over Egypt´s consumption.;The given chart illustrates the consumption of three basic foods (wheat, maize, rice) by people in four different countries, which are Cambodia, Poland, Egypt, and Mexico. At a glance, it is evident that the consumption patterns of these staple foods vary significantly across the four nations.Rice is the most consumed food in Cambodia, with a significant margin, whereas in Egypt and Mexico, wheat is the primary staple food. In contrast, Poland stands out as the only country where maize is not a dominant food source, and instead, wheat and rice are consumed in relatively equal amounts. In terms of comparison, Cambodia and Egypt exhibit distinct consumption patterns, with rice and wheat being the primary staples, respectively. On the other hand, Mexico's consumption is evenly distributed among the three foods, with a slight inclination towards maize. Poland's consumption pattern is unique, with a notable absence of maize in the diet.Another notable feature is the varying levels of consumption across the countries. For instance, Egypt has the highest consumption of wheat, while Cambodia has the highest consumption of rice.

892;The table below shows the salaries of secondary/high school teachers in 2009. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparison where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The table gives information about the salaries of secondary school teachers in different countries in 2009. The main differences between the countries are two. First, a discrepancy concerns the starting salary of teachers. Second, there is a gap in the years that teachers need to teach before obtaining the maximum salary.On the one hand, the starting salaries of teachers in the selected countries are slightly different. Luxemburg teachers reach the highest starting salary, equal to 80,000. Instead, in Australia, there are the least paid teachers, they have less than 30,000 per year. There is an enormous discrepancy between Luxemburg, in which the starting salaries are the highest ones, and the other countries. Although Denmark is the second country in giving higher salaries, the money teachers reach the first years of teaching is 45.000.On the other hand, another discrepancy concerns the years that a teacher has to teach before reaching the maximum salary. Indeed, despite being the least-paid teachers, Australians obtain the maximum salary after 9 years of teaching and obtain 48.000 per year. Instead, Luxemburg requires 30 years of work to give teachers the maximum salary, which is also the highest among the countries, and corresponds to 130.000. Denmark is the country in which high-school teachers obtain the maximum salary in just 8 years. On the completely opposite side, Japan teachers have to teach for at least 37 years before obtaining the highest salary.;The table provides a comprehensive overview of the salaries of secondary school teachers in various countries in 2009. Upon analyzing the data, two significant differences emerge among the countries. Firstly, there is a notable discrepancy in the starting salary of teachers. The data reveals that some countries offer substantially higher starting salaries compared to others. For instance, teachers in certain countries can start with a salary above $40,000, whereas in other countries, the starting salary is significantly lower, sometimes below $20,000. This variation highlights the differences in the compensation packages offered to new teachers across different nations.Secondly, there is a considerable gap in the number of years teachers need to teach before obtaining the maximum salary. The table shows that in some countries, teachers can reach the maximum salary in less than 10 years, while in other countries, it may take over 20 years to achieve the same milestone. This disparity underscores the varying career progression paths and salary scales in place for teachers across different countries. The difference in the number of years required to reach the maximum salary also implies differences in the level of experience and expertise that teachers are expected to accumulate before being considered for the highest pay grade.These differences have significant implications for teacher recruitment, retention, and motivation, as well as the overall quality of education in these countries. The comparison of starting salaries and the years required to reach the maximum salary provides valuable insights into the teaching profession's attractiveness and the incentives offered to teachers in different countries. Overall, the table highlights the need for a more nuanced understanding of the factors influencing teacher salaries and career development across different educational systems.

A closer examination of the data reveals some notable trends and patterns. Overall, the sales figures indicate that dinner consumption was the primary driver of revenue throughout the week, significantly outpacing lunch sales across all days.From Monday to Friday, the restaurant experienced a steady stream of customers, with dinner sales consistently surpassing lunch sales. This is not surprising, given the restaurant's location in a downtown business district, where professionals often gather for evening meals after work. The data suggests that the restaurant is a popular choice for business dinners and evening outings.However, a notable decline in sales is observed over the weekend, from Saturday to Sunday. This drop is evident in both lunch and dinner sales, although dinner sales still maintain a higher volume than lunch sales. The decrease in weekend sales could be attributed to the area's reduced foot traffic, as the business district is likely less populated on Saturdays and Sundays.In comparison, the weekdays demonstrate a more even distribution of sales, with a peak in dinner sales on certain days, such as Thursdays, which may indicate a popular night for business gatherings or social events. In contrast, the weekend sales are markedly lower, suggesting that the restaurant may need to adjust its strategy to attract more customers during these days, such as offering special promotions or discounts. Overall, the data highlights the restaurant's reliance on dinner sales and its potential to optimize its weekend offerings to boost revenue.

At a glance, it is evident that the coffee shop experiences a surge in sales during specific periods of the day, particularly in the morning. Overall, drinks like tea and coffee have the highest sales in the morning, indicating that office workers often start their day with a hot beverage. Similarly, pastries also exhibit high sales in the morning, suggesting that they are a popular accompaniment to tea and coffee. This trend is likely driven by the convenience and quick energy boost that pastries provide to office workers rushing to start their day. However, the sales pattern shifts in the afternoon, with more sandwiches being sold during this time. This could be attributed to the fact that office workers often take a lunch break in the afternoon, and sandwiches are a more substantial meal option compared to pastries. The afternoon sales of sandwiches likely cater to the lunchtime crowd, providing a satisfying and filling meal to fuel the rest of the workday.In comparison, the morning and afternoon sales patterns reveal distinct consumer preferences. While morning sales are dominated by tea, coffee, and pastries, the afternoon sees a rise in sandwich sales. This dichotomy highlights the coffee shop's ability to adapt to the changing needs of office workers throughout the day, providing a range of options to suit different meal periods.

1168;The table below shows the table made by a coffee shop in an office building on a typical weekday.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The given table presents the detailed amounts of four products that are daily sold in a coffee shop located in an office building. These products include coffee, tea, pastries, and sandwiches. As is shown by the table the data is categorized into four periods on a typical weekday from 7:30 until 20:30.From the first row of the given diagram, it is clear that pastries and coffee are the favorite products during the first three hours of the day, with 275 and 265 units, respectively.The next period has the sandwiches as the most common product between 10:30 and 14:30, while coffee maintain its position at the second place with 185 sales.Turning to the afternoon, during which pastries again retain the dominance with 150 sales in the hours 14:30- 17:30, and coffee occupies again the second place with 145.At the end of the day, this coffee shop sees, for the first time, that coffee is the most bought item at a specific period of the day with 200 cups of coffee served for the clients, while sandwiches this time come second with 110.Turning to tea, which is apparently the least popular product in this place during most of the time apart from the morning hours. The tea sales stand at 110, 50, 35, and 75 in this chronological order.Overall, coffee is the most stable item during the day, as it occupies the first or the second places over the whole period given in this table.;The table provided by the coffee shop in the office building offers a detailed breakdown of the daily sales of four key products: coffee, tea, pastries, and sandwiches. These sales are categorized into four distinct periods on a typical weekday, from 7:30 to 20:30.

Between 10:30 and 13:30, there is a notable increase in the sales of sandwiches, which becomes the top-selling item during this period. This surge in sandwich sales can be attributed to the lunch hour, where office workers seek more substantial meals. Coffee remains a steady seller throughout the day, with a slight increase during the lunch period, possibly due to its pairing with lunch items.The late afternoon period, from 13:30 to 17:30, sees a decline in sales across all items, as expected, given that it falls between the lunch and dinner times. However, there is a slight resurgence in pastry sales, potentially indicating that office workers are seeking a late-afternoon snack.Lastly, from 17:30 to 20:30, the sales of all items experience a notable decrease, reflecting the end of the workday and the subsequent reduction in foot traffic within the office building. Overall, the table presents a clear picture of how the demand for coffee shop items fluctuates throughout a typical weekday, highlighting the importance of coffee and sandwiches as staple items, and pastries and tea as complementary products that cater to various consumer needs at different times of the day.

836;The table displays the average monthly rainfall for the year in five cities of the world.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The following table gives information on the average monthly rainfall in five cities. In the first row of the table, every month of the year is shown, from January to December. In the first column of the table, five cities are visible; Hongkong,Tokyo,Jakarta,Cairo, and London. The following cities are from very different parts of the world, this why there is great differences between the values. The city with the least rainfall was Cairo, hence there was not any rain from September to December, while Hongkong and Jakarta have had significantly more rain throughout the year. Hongkong peaked at 380mm of rain in August, and experienced the greatest fluctiation in monthly rainfall, with the biggest difference between January and August. In Tokyo, there is a steady increase in monthly rainfall from January to December, with only slight deviations. Jakrata seen the most rain in January, with an outstanding 300mm, which decreases until August, then starts increasing again until December. London is the most consistent out of the 5 cities, with the biggest difference between months being 25mm of rain.";The table provides a comprehensive overview of the average monthly rainfall in five major cities around the world, including Hong Kong, Tokyo, Jakarta, Cairo, and London. These cities, situated in diverse geographical locations, exhibit significant variations in their average monthly rainfall, underscoring the vast climatic differences that exist across the globe.At a glance, it is evident that the rainfall patterns in these cities are heavily influenced by their geographical positions. For instance, cities like Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Jakarta, which are located near the equator or in regions known for high levels of precipitation, show higher average monthly rainfall compared to Cairo and London. Cairo, being a desert city, naturally records the least amount of rainfall, highlighting the extreme arid conditions of its location. On the other hand, cities like London, which experiences a more temperate climate, falls somewhere in between, with its rainfall averages being modest but consistent throughout the year.The variations in rainfall among these cities not only reflect their unique climatic conditions but also underscore the importance of geographical factors such as latitude, altitude, and proximity to large bodies of water in determining precipitation patterns.

By examining these variations, it becomes clear that each city's rainfall pattern is a reflection of its specific environmental and geographical context, making the comparison a valuable insight into the complexities of global climate conditions.
788;The table displays trends concerning the amounts of fast food consumed in Melbourne. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevantYou should write at least 150 words.;The table outlines the past, present, and future consumption of five types of fast food. Comparing the consumption in 2005 with the present level, it is clear that all consumptios of fast food has increased since 2005 except for the hamburger. While this trend suggests that hamburger consumption is in decline, projected consumption in 2025 shows that burgers would gain renewed interest.Moving the attention away from hamburgers, we can see that the increase in salad consumption is more drastic than that of other fast food categories. Specifically, the predicted increase in fried chicken consumption is 10 units, which is outshadowed by the 36-unit increase for salad. This suggests that, while more fast food will be consumed overall, the general public is shifting towards healthier options.Finally, although the consumption for hamburger, friedn chicken, and salad all increased significantly, figures for fried rice and noodles remained stagnant. This suggests that both fried rice and noodles are less welcomed by the consumers compared to other fast food.;The table illustrates the trends in fast food consumption in Melbourne, outlining the past, present, and future consumption of five types of fast food. A thorough analysis of the data reveals significant changes in consumption patterns over the years. Comparing the consumption in 2005 with the present level, it is clear that all consumption has increased since 2005 except for the hamburger, which has experienced a decline. This suggests a shift in consumer preferences away from traditional fast food options like hamburgers.Moving away from hamburgers, a notable trend emerges. The increase in salad consumption is more drastic than that of other fast food categories. This indicates a growing demand for healthier fast food options, as consumers become more health-conscious. The significant rise in salad consumption can be attributed to the increasing awareness of the importance of a balanced diet and the need for nutritious meals on-the-go.In contrast, the consumption of other fast food categories, such as pizza and fries, has also increased, but at a slower rate compared to salads. This suggests that while consumers are still drawn to traditional fast food options, there is a growing preference for healthier alternatives. The data also provides insight into future consumption trends, allowing for predictions and planning for the fast food industry. Overall, the table highlights a shift towards healthier fast food options, with salad consumption leading the way, and a decline in traditional fast food options like hamburgers. These trends have significant implications for the fast food industry, which must adapt to changing consumer preferences to remain competitive.
889;The tendency of news reports in the media to focus more on problems and emergencies rather than on positive developments is harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole.To what extent do you agree or disagree?;News reports in the media focus on problems and emergencies more often than on some positive events. Is it really harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole?Let us consider the purpose of the media existence first. I suppose it is to spread important information, so that people may use it in their lives. And problems are usually more important than some positive developments, since, in fact, they are the things which people should be aware of in the first place. For example, due to the COVID, which is an international problem, many people lost their jobs. If they had been notified about the rising of pandemic though, they would have prepared somehow (save more money by cutting unnecessary expenses, learn a new profession and so forth).Moreover, I believe problems shall be solved. And when people are concerned about some problems, they may tend to face them with honor and participate in solving them. For instance, the energy crisis is a huge problem, and it is important to aware society of it, so that individuals could try to be more careful with gas and electricity. In the end, society will benefit from it, so it is not harmful.On the other hand, there is some negative impact of bad news on individuals sometimes. But I am sure it should be considered as psychological issues of particular individuals, rather than a problem of today's media system. People just should not fall in despair because of news reports, but think how they could take an advantage of the provided information to minimize a negative impact and help humanity to solve problems.Finally, in my view, the stated tendency is not really harmful to society, but it may sometimes be harmful to the individuals, and they are responsible for it.;The tendency of news reports in the media to focus more on problems and emergencies rather than on positive developments is a prevalent phenomenon. It is evident that news reports in the media focus on problems and emergencies more often than on some positive events, which can create a biased and pessimistic view of the world. However, to what extent this is harmful to individuals and society as a whole is a matter of debate.On one hand, the constant exposure to negative news can have a detrimental impact on individuals' mental health and outlook. The emphasis on problems and emergencies can create a sense of hopelessness and despair, which can lead to increased stress and anxiety levels. Moreover, this negative reporting can also perpetuate a culture of fear and mistrust, ultimately affecting social cohesion and community relationships.On the other hand, there is some negative impact of bad news on individuals, sometimes leading to a decrease in motivation and a sense of disempowerment. For instance, excessive coverage of natural disasters or violent crimes can lead to a feeling of vulnerability and powerlessness among viewers. Nevertheless, it can also be argued that reporting on problems and emergencies serves as a necessary function, alerting the public to potential dangers and mobilizing support for those affected.In conclusion, while the focus on problems and emergencies in news reports can have some negative consequences, it is not entirely harmful to individuals and society. A balanced approach, incorporating both positive and negative news, is essential for a well-informed and resilient society. By presenting a more nuanced view of the world, media outlets can promote a more accurate understanding of reality, ultimately fostering a more empathetic and proactive community.

Specifically, It is Sweden, and Germany. It was 34,27 in 2007 in Sweden and Germany, whereas it was 42 and 62 in Sweden and Germany in 2009 respectively. Especially in German students, the number doubled. On the other hand, other countries, such as France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherland can be seen a slight reduction from 2007 to 2009. But the total number increased from 189 to 226, in 2007, and 2009.When it comes to Australian international students who study in Europe, have not changed the total number of students. It is 152, in 2007 and 2009. On the other hand, the number of students soared in two countries, such as France, and Germany.It was 37, 18 in France, and Germany in 2007 respectively. It increased to 58, 26 in France and Germany. In contrast, there are reduction in three countries, in Sweden, The United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Especially in the Netherland, the number of Australian students plummeted from 32 to 18 between 2007 and 2009.France and Germany in 2009.;The two tables provided illustrate the exchange students from universities in Europe to Australia between 2007 and 2009. A summary of the main features reveals an upward trend in the total number of European students traveling to Australia, with a notable increase by 2009. In contrast, the total number of Australian students participating in the exchange program remained stagnant from 2007 to 2009, showing no significant fluctuation.A comparison of the data between different European countries highlights Sweden and Germany as notable examples. In 2007, these countries had 34 and 27 exchange students in Australia, respectively. However, by 2009, the numbers had increased to 42 for Sweden and 62 for Germany. This significant rise in student exchange numbers from these two countries suggests a growing interest in Australia as a destination for European students.The overall increase in European students traveling to Australia in 2009, coupled with the specific growth from countries like Sweden and Germany, underscores a broader trend of heightened mobility and interest in international educational experiences. The stability in the number of Australian students participating in the exchange, meanwhile, suggests a consistent level of engagement from the Australian side, which did not mirror the growth seen from European participants.In conclusion, the data from the two tables paints a picture of a burgeoning exchange program between European universities and Australia, with particular countries like Sweden and Germany leading the charge. As international educational collaborations continue to evolve, understanding these trends will be crucial for fostering greater cooperation and exchange opportunities between Europe and Australia.
661;The typical teaching situation of a teacher and students in the class will not exist by the year 2050. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;For many years, the traditional teaching and learning (T&L) approach, i.e., having a teacher disseminating knowledge to a group of students in a classroom, is dominent over the world.With the advancement of information and communication technology, new learning approaches have been proposed and adopted. For example, students can now use computers to surf the internet to find information or knowledge they would like to study. Moreover, a number of pre-recorded education contents are now available online to provide classes/tutorials to learners. It is expected that this tradition T&L approach will not exist by 2050. Would it be true?There is no doube that there is an increasing number of T&L approaches due to emergence of new technologies. Together with the new approaches, we see there is a shift of the role of teachers these years, not only as one who is responsible to disseminate knowledge, but also a faciliator of learning. Teachers provide proper directions to students during their study, where current technology is not able to offer. Some people say the artificial technology is a threat, but still the accuracy of providing suggestions to students is not very high. Moreover, human teachers are able to provide emotional support to students. Studying is not just a robotic process of human beings. Students may encounter difficulties during the learning process and feel frustrated, which will eventually affect their progression in study. Human teachers could be more aware on this situation, not by the numeric assessment results, but the emotional behaviour of the students in the classroom, and provide prompt and proper counselling support and advice to the students.Also, it is still well-known that computers, even with AI, are weak in creating new knowledge. In the university setting, other than teaching the conventional knowledge, professors would disseminate their new research findings to the students in the class, with discussion among the students, inspiring them to the unexplored areas. This T&L process can only be effective when it happens in a classroom setting.In conclusion, technology may alter the way how we teach and learn. In spite of this, human teachers are also adaptive and certain roles of the teachers cannot be replaced by other tools or machines. Therefore, I believe that the tradition classroom T&L setting cannot be replaced completedly in the future.;The traditional classroom teaching and learning (T&L) approach has been the cornerstone of education for centuries. However, with the rapid advancement of technology and changing pedagogical philosophies, it is expected that this typical teaching situation will undergo a significant transformation by the year 2050. I agree that the traditional classroom setting, where a teacher stands at the front of the classroom disseminating knowledge to students, will not exist in its current form by 2050.In recent years, there has been a shift in the role of teachers, from being the sole providers of knowledge to facilitators of learning. This change acknowledges that students learn in diverse ways and that teachers should guide and support their learning journey, rather than simply imparting information. By 2050, this shift is likely to become even more pronounced, with teachers acting as mentors, coaches, and learning designers, helping students to navigate a more personalized and autonomous learning path.One aspect that will remain essential, despite the advancements in technology, is the human element that teachers bring to the learning environment. Human teachers are uniquely able to provide emotional support, empathy, and understanding to students, which are critical for their emotional and psychological development. While technology can offer efficient and accessible learning resources, it cannot replace the nuanced and compassionate interactions that human teachers provide. Therefore, even as the classroom and the teaching role evolve, the importance of human teachers in providing emotional and psychological support will endure.In conclusion, by 2050, the traditional classroom T&L approach is indeed expected to evolve significantly, with teachers taking on more facilitative roles and technology integrating deeply into the learning process. However, the core value of human interaction in education, particularly the emotional support that teachers can offer, will continue to be a vital component of the educational experience.
803;The use of corporal punishment (physically hitting students) in schools is in decline, yet it should be used to improve behaviour.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people believe that modifying behaviour among school-going children can be achieved through corporal punishment, and that it being on the decline in schools, is actually a negative development. I strongly disagree with this this view as I am of the opinion that there are better ways of disciplining children to instill positive behaviour, than physically hitting them.Improvement of behaviour among children in schools can be achieved through teaching them good manners rather than using corporal punishment. This means that teachers and school staff should teach children acceptable and unacceptable behaviour as part of their school curriculum from the earleist age they enter school. This way, learners obtain knowledge required for them to practice good behaviour. For example, if a child is taught from primary school-going age that they should clean after their mess, they are likely to practise and carry this behaviour through to secondary school. That way, there would be no need to physically hit children. Although some may firmly believe that corporal punishment is a good form of discipline, it cannot be compared to the actual teaching of good behaviour.Moreover, corporal punishment is likely to produce a fearful and resentful child rather than a well mannered child. It has been found by many researchers that children are unlikely to change their bad behaviour because they are beaten up at school. The behaviour is most likely to get worse, instead, as learners become fearful and resent their learning environment. For instance, in South Africa, some learners were reported to be disrespectful to their teachers because of a bad relationship that existed between them and their teachers as a result of corporal punishment that was inflicted on them. While it may be true that some positive behaviour changes were seen among pupils due to use of corporal punishment, this is at a very small scale.In conclusion, I am of the view that the use of corporal punishment among school-going age children is not a desirable phenomenon, as it is unlikely to produce any required behavioural changes. Instead, instilling good manners in learners through teaching them is more effective, as physically hitting them may even worsen their undesirable behaviour.;The use of corporal punishment in schools has been a long-standing debate, with some arguing that it is an effective means of improving behaviour, while others contend that it is a outdated and inhumane practice. I strongly disagree with the statement that corporal punishment should be used to improve behaviour. Corporal punishment among school-going age children is not a desirable phenomenon, as it can lead to physical and emotional harm, as well as create a culture of fear and intimidation in schools.Instead of resorting to physical punishment, I believe that instilling good manners in learners through teaching them is a more effective approach. By incorporating values such as respect, empathy, and self-discipline into the curriculum, students can develop positive behaviours and attitudes that will benefit them throughout their lives. This approach not only promotes a more positive and supportive learning environment but also helps students to develop essential life skills.Research has shown that children are unlikely to change their bad behaviour because they are beaten up at school. In fact, corporal punishment can often lead to increased aggression, decreased self-esteem, and a range of other negative outcomes. For example, studies have found that students who are subjected to corporal punishment are more likely to exhibit problem behaviours, such as fighting and disobedience, and are less likely to achieve academic success. Therefore, it is clear that corporal punishment is not an effective means of improving behaviour and should be abolished in favour of more positive and supportive approaches to discipline and behaviour management. By focusing on teaching and guiding students, rather than punishing them, we can create a more positive and effective learning environment that promotes the well-being and success of all students.
76;The world health organization recommends that people should eat five or more portion of fruit and vegetables per day. The bar chart shows the percentage of males and females in the UK by age group in 2006.You should write at least 150 words.;This bar chart depicts the percentage between male and female to eat five or above portion of fruit and vegetables per day in the UK. It is clear from the graph that the female is higher than male of percentage.According to what is shown, gradually increased from 19 to 34 ages same that from 35 to 54 ages. Between 55 and 64 ages is siginficant increased about between 19 and 24 ages, After that gradually decreased between 65 and 74. Although, Supposed to 25 and 34 ages, They the more consum but between 55 and 64 ages they is consum the highest. Also, The 75 age is the same percentage, unlike the all under 75 ages.To sum up, we could say that, the all ages is not equal between male and female in same percentage ages, except 75 age, They slight by 25 per cent between unisex. On other hand, Female and male is equal consume in 75 age.;The World Health Organization emphasizes the importance of a balanced diet, which includes consuming at least five portions of fruit and vegetables daily. A bar chart illustrating the percentage of males and females in the UK, categorized by age group, who adhere to this recommendation in 2006, provides valuable insights into the eating habits of the British population. This bar chart specifically depicts the percentage of males and females who eat five or more portions of fruit and vegetables per day, shedding light on the dietary choices of different demographics.It is evident from the graph that females have a higher percentage of adherence to the recommended daily intake of fruit and vegetables compared to males across various age groups. This disparity suggests that women in the UK are more likely to prioritize a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, which is crucial for maintaining good health and preventing chronic diseases. The difference in eating habits between genders could be attributed to various factors, including lifestyle,,assistant's knowledge cutoff in 2023,  cultural influences, and personal preferences.The data presented in the bar chart has significant implications for public health strategies. Understanding the demographics that are less likely to meet the daily recommended intake of fruits and vegetables can help in tailoring interventions and educational campaigns to encourage healthier eating habits among these groups. For instance, targeted programs could be designed to promote the benefits of a fruit and vegetable-rich diet among males, aiming to bridge the gap in dietary habits between genders. By doing so, the UK can move closer to achieving better overall health outcomes for its population, in line with the World Health Organization's recommendations. Ultimately, the bar chart serves as a reminder of the importance of continuous monitoring and assessment of dietary habits to inform effective health promotion strategies.
1426;The world is experiencing a dramatic increase in population, which is causing problems not only for poor, undeveloped countries, but also for industrialized and developed nations. Describe some of the problems that overpopulation causes, and suggest at least one possible solution.;You should write at least 250 words.You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.Nowadays, the population dramatically in most countries around the world. This is true for the developed and developing nations. Overpopulation a different number of problems. However, the government can these problems in many .There are several problems that the raising number of people in undeveloped countries causes. Firstly, it is very difficult to provide enough food for all people. Secondly, the government limits the number of children per family in school. In addition, in poorest countries usually have , and when the population increases, the number of . Finally, when too many people live on the land, the environment suffers.There are different problems that overpopulation causes in rich nations. Firstly, it is very difficult for governments to provide helpful public services in overcrowded cities. Moreover, there is generally a higher level of crimes being committed, such as drugs abuse, murders, thefts, . often cause by the high rates of unemployment.However, overpopulation problems in nations have two main which they are by governments. Firstly, the government must educate people about limiting the size of the family. For example, in China they have a policy called “one child policy” which limits the size of the family to one or two children, and this is beginning to have an effect on the world’s most crowded nation.To sum up, if the impulsive population increase continues, many more people will die of hunger in the poor countries. Also, in rich nations, the life in the cities will become more and more difficult.;The world is currently facing a significant challenge due to the rapid increase in population, affecting not only underdeveloped countries but also industrialized and developed nations. Overpopulation poses several problems, particularly in underdeveloped countries. Firstly, it becomes increasingly difficult to provide sufficient food for the growing population, leading to widespread hunger and malnutrition. Secondly, governments are forced to implement strict family planning policies, such as limiting the number of children per family, in order to curb the population growth. For instance, some schools in these countries only allow a certain number of children per family to enroll, which can be a significant challenge for large families.Furthermore, when too many people live on a limited land area, the environment suffers greatly. Deforestation, pollution, and loss of biodiversity are just a few of the consequences of overpopulation on the environment. In developed nations, overpopulation problems are often addressed through government initiatives. The two main approaches taken by governments include implementing sustainable urban planning and promoting family planning education. Sustainable urban planning involves designing cities in a way that accommodates a large population while minimizing the strain on resources and infrastructure. On the other hand, promoting family planning education empowers individuals, especially women, to make informed decisions about their reproductive health, thereby reducing the population growth rate.In conclusion, overpopulation is a pressing issue that requires immediate attention and action from governments and individuals alike. By understanding the problems caused by overpopulation and implementing effective solutions, we can work towards creating a more sustainable and equitable world for future generations. It is essential for governments to take proactive measures to address overpopulation, and for individuals to make responsible choices regarding family planning and environmental conservation.
1313;There are many things that can motivate people to perform well in their work. These can include the salary, job satisfaction or the chance to help others. What do you feel is the best motivation to do well at work?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"To perform well in a job, people have to be motivated. There are multiple strategies for employers to incentivise their employees. The most obvious one is the salary; however, job satisfaction and the ability to help people are other methods of improving performance at work.For the majority of the people, receiving their salary at the end of the month is their motivation. This is because money is necessary to fulfill the most basic needs and other materialistic desires. Employees see these opportunities when receiving their salary and therefore work to achieve money. Furthermore, performing well in a job can often lead to promotions with higher pay packages. To receive this, staff have to stand out positively in their jobs. Salary is therefore a key motivational tool for many workforce participants.However, money is far from being the only incentive. Another aspect affecting performance is job satisfaction. If a person is comfortable in their work, they are more likely to perform well. Therefore this motivational tool interlinks with salary, as when people are content and perform well, the chances of promotion increase. For some individuals though, only their passion can drive them. Prime examples for this are humanitarian jobs. The salaries are often not very high, but those choosing to work in this field are often very driven; their passion to help others is prioritised over their own salary.In conclusion, while income might be the most common motivational factor, it is unusual to be the sole incentive for working hard, and some people are motivated wholly due to other reasons.";When it comes to motivating people to perform well in their work, there are several factors that come into play. While salary is a key motivational tool for many people, it is not the only one. In fact, research has shown that job satisfaction and the ability to help others are equally, if not more, important motivators for many individuals.For instance, a study found that employees who were motivated by a sense of purpose and meaning in their work were more productive and had higher job satisfaction rates than those who were solely motivated by salary. This suggests that the ability to make a positive impact on others can be a powerful motivator. Many people in the healthcare and education sectors, for example, are driven by a desire to help others, and this motivation enables them to perform at high levels despite often being paid less than their counterparts in other industries.Furthermore, job satisfaction is also a crucial motivator. When employees feel that their work is valued, recognized, and contributes to the organization's goals, they are more likely to be motivated to perform well. This can be achieved through recognition, opportunities for growth and development, and a positive work environment. For example, companies like Google and Facebook are known for their innovative and collaborative work cultures, which motivate employees to perform at high levels and drive innovation.In conclusion, while salary is an important motivator, it is not the only one. Job satisfaction and the ability to help others are equally important, if not more so, in driving performance at work. Employers who recognize and cater to these motivators are likely to see improved productivity, job satisfaction, and overall performance from their employees. By providing a sense of purpose, recognition, and opportunities for growth, employers can unlock the full potential of their employees and drive success.
1284;There is a moral necessity today for the richer countries of the world to help the poorer countries develop in terms of feeding the population, education and health care. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The world today is often divided into two categories, more developed and less developed countries. This division is significant in terms of health, wealth and education. To minimise this gap, it is argued that richer countries are morally responsible to support the less wealthy. I, personally, feel that the prosperous countries are obligated and expected to to contribute to the development of countries with weaker economies.To address this argument, the history of the wealthy countries is relevant. Many less developed countries are former colonies, therefore the wealthy countries had a historical impact on the less wealthy. Thus, richer countries’ economies were dependent on the currently less developed countries for their rich status. Furthermore, even today the wealthy countries contribute to the wealth inequality by exploiting the inhabitants of less developed countries, giving workers lower wages than people within their own countries. Due to this dependence on poorer countries and the influence that the richer countries have had on the imbalance, it can be concluded that richer countries are indeed morally obliged to help the less wealthy countries.Opposing this is the view that each country is in charge of their own inhabitants and that therefore they need to provide health, education and basic necessities for themselves. In addition, simply providing these three services would not lead to closing the wealth gap. It would rather be helpful to invest sustainably in poorer countries and help them create their own systems, allowing these countries to be self-sufficient.In conclusion, while there is a moral necessity for wealthy countries to aid the poorer ones, simply providing basic necessities is not sufficient. A more sustainable idea would be to teach countries to plan and provide for themselves by giving economic incentives.;"The world today is often divided into two categories: more developed and less developed countries. This division is characterized by vast disparities in standards of living, economic opportunities, and access to basic necessities like food, education, and healthcare. To minimize this gap, it is argued that richer countries are morally responsible to support the less wealthy. I agree with this statement to a significant extent, as it is undeniable that the more fortunate nations have a duty to assist those struggling to meet the basic needs of their populations.Richer countries have a moral obligation to provide aid to poorer nations, especially in areas such as feeding the population, assistantThe world today is often divided into two categories: more developed and less developed countries. This division is characterized by vast disparities in standards of living, economic opportunities, and access to basic necessities like food, education, and healthcare. To minimize this gap, it is argued that richer countries are morally responsible to support the less wealthy. I agree with this statement to a significant extent, as it is undeniable that the more fortunate nations have a duty to assist those struggling to meet the basic needs of their populations.Providing food, education, and healthcare are fundamental steps towards development. For instance, programs like the World Food Programme and UNICEF have been instrumental in reducing hunger and improving health outcomes in less developed countries. Moreover, educational initiatives supported by richer countries have enhanced literacy rates and equipped future generations with the skills necessary for economic growth. However, simply providing these basic necessities would not lead to closing the wealth gap. Sustainable development requires more comprehensive strategies, including investments in infrastructure, technology, and human resources, as well as policy reforms that promote economic stability and fairness.Ultimately, the moral necessity for richer countries to help poorer ones extends beyond mere charity; it involves a strategic and long-term commitment to empowering less developed nations to become self-sufficient and competitive in the global economy. By doing so, not only do we address the immediate needs of vulnerable populations, but we also lay the groundwork for a more equitable and interconnected world. In conclusion, while the provision of basic necessities is a critical first step, it must be accompanied by broader developmental strategies to truly bridge the divide between the richer and poorer countries."
1427;There is no longer enough natural resources to sustain current levels of economic growth. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Recently, the natural resources risen dramatically across the world due to population growth. Some people state that we enough resources. However, there are some individuals who disagree with this opinion. In this essay, the issues behind this phenomenon will be examined.On the one hand, some people state that if will continue to we cannot have a comfortable life because natural resources are limited. According to a if this situation will continue, the petrol will in 2050. Moreover, it is widely said that the will increase. This will make the amount of natural .On the other hand, there are some individuals who disagree with above-mentioned perception. The natural resources will technology. For example, the of technology such as cars a positive impact the society. By using this, we can the consumption of natural resources. Eventually, we will not need natural fuel. In my opinion, of natural is , I think the loss of it a negative impact the society because won’t have a comfortable life any more.In conclusion, I agree with the idea that there is no longer enough natural resources to sustain this situation. In order to our life, the governments countries should tackle this issue.;The notion that there are no longer enough natural resources to sustain current levels of economic growth has sparked a heated debate among scholars and experts. On one hand, it is undeniable that the demand for natural resources has risen dramatically across the world due to population growth and increasing consumption patterns. The world's population has grown exponentially over the past century, leading to a significant surge in the demand for resources such as water, food, and energy.Some people argue that we have enough resources to sustain our current levels of economic growth, citing advancements in technology and efficiency improvements. They point out that human ingenuity and innovation have consistently allowed us to find new ways to extract, produce, and utilize resources, leading to increased productivity and economic expansion. According to this perspective, the Earth's natural resources are sufficient to meet our current needs, and with proper management, we can continue to grow economically without depleting them.However, there are some individuals who strongly disagree with this opinion. They argue that the current rate of resource depletion is unsustainable and will eventually lead to environmental degradation, economic instability, and social unrest. These critics point to the alarming rates of deforestation, water pollution, and climate change as evidence that our current consumption patterns are already pushing the planet's resources to the breaking point. They contend that the pursuit of endless economic growth is a flawed concept that ignores the fundamental limits of the Earth's ecosystem and will ultimately lead to catastrophic consequences.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, it is clear that the relationship between natural resources and economic growth is complex and multifaceted. As the world's population continues to grow, it is essential that we reassess our consumption patterns and strive for a more sustainable and equitable use of resources to ensure a livable future for generations to come.
1324;These days, many young people are not spending their weekends and holidays doing outdoor activities such as hiking or mountaineering. Why is that happening? How can they be encouraged to spend more time in the natural environment?;Nowadays, the younger generation tends to avoid recreational activities such as hiking or alpinism. It seems that young people prefer to spend their weekends indoors, gaming or engaging in other online activities. If that is the case, by promoting sports more actively and organising sports competitions, the schools could counteract this trend.Living in the era of technology, the wide availability and variety of online entertainment are compelling young people to spend a lot of their free time indoors, using their gadgets. Numerous relatively cheap forms of amusement, such as online games, videos, audiobooks and plenty of other activities, tempt teenagers to stay at home and lead more sedentary lifestyles. A recent survey revealed that the vast majority of students would prefer spending their weekends playing computer games, rather than in the nature. That is one clear reason why our modern youth is less interested in recreational sports.To address this issue, the school management could intervene and offer a better range of outdoor sports activities and competitions, both within the school curriculum and as extra-curricular activities. For example, high schools could increase the number of weekly football, running and climbing classes, and organise competitions at the end of each term. As a result, pushed by their desire to win, students would do more walking, jogging, running and mountaineering during the school term, in preparation for the competition. This would reduce the time spent online, lessen the students’ dependence on the Internet for entertainment, and eventually boost their desire to spend more time enjoying the natural environment.To sum up, screen addiction plays a major role in young people’s avoidance of various outdoor activities. Opening up more recreational sports and offering frequent competitions on school grounds is a great way to motivate more students to spend their leisure time in the nature.;The trend of young people spending less time outdoors and engaging in fewer physical activities has become a pressing concern in recent years. Many youngsters nowadays prefer to spend their weekends and holidays indoors,,assistant,The trend of young people spending less time outdoors and engaging in fewer physical activities has become a pressing concern in recent years. Many youngsters nowadays prefer to spend their weekends and holidays indoors, glued to their screens, rather than exploring the great outdoors. This is particularly evident in the decline of participation in outdoor activities such as hiking or mountaineering. The younger generation tends to avoid recreational activities such as hiking or alpinism, opting instead for more sedentary pursuits.There are several reasons contributing to this trend. The widespread use of technology and social media has led to a significant decrease in outdoor activities among young people. Furthermore, the increasing urbanization and lack of access to natural environments in many areas also play a role. However, it is crucial that we take steps to encourage the younger generation to spend more time in nature. One effective way to achieve this is through schools. By promoting sports more actively and organising sports competitions, the schools could counteract this trend. For instance, schools could offer outdoor adventure programs, such as hiking or rock climbing, as part of their physical education curriculum. This would not only promote physical activity but also foster an appreciation for nature and the environment.Additionally, schools could collaborate with local outdoor organizations to provide students with opportunities to participate in outdoor activities, such as park cleanups or conservation projects. By making outdoor activities accessible and engaging, we can inspire young people to develop a lifelong love for nature and outdoor pursuits. Ultimately, it is essential that we take collective action to promote outdoor activities among young people, and schools play a vital role in this endeavor. By working together, we can ensure that future generations appreciate and protect the natural environment.
919;To be labelled a ‘Work of Art’, a painting, sculpture or other art form should display certain qualities that are unique. However, over the past century there has been a decline in the quality of prize-winning artwork and it is now possible for quite ordinary pieces of art to be labelled ‘masterpieces ’ whilst true works of art pass unnoticed.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;For centuries, artworks have been titled  'Work of Art' based on their extraordinary qualities. However, some people argue that nowadays, the standards are decreasing and the labelling of substandard artworks as 'masterpieces' has become ubiquitous. The upcoming essay will discuss why I agree that original paintings are being neglected while usual ones are being praised.Firstly, the superficial nature of humans is responsible for this change. These days, people do not see the meaning behind the painting or the message the artist is trying to convey rather they buy those paintings which are popular and contemporary. To illustrate it further, in art auctions it can be seen that when one person bids on one painting, no matter whether it is good or bad, others also start putting their money on it. Thus it is clear that normal art forms are winning prizes due to public attention.Secondly, some artists might bribe the organizers of exhibitions to promote their canvas. Indeed, there have been some recorded instances when artists were caught while signing up deals to increase the sales of their work. If a certain artwork receives publicity then it is impossible that it would not have an influence on the public. This type of promotion skews a person's opinion about a certain picture and so are forced to think about purchasing it, leaving behind original ones. Therefore, it is apparent that the diabolical activities of painters are responsible for their works being labelled as masterpieces.To conclude, the maintenance of social position and influence of painters are the prime causes for the popularity of ordinary artworks and the negligence of true works. Hence I agree with the given statement.;"The concept of what constitutes a ""Work of Art"" has been a topic of debate for centuries. Some people argue that nowadays, the standards are decreasing and the labelling of substandard artworks as'masterpieces' has become ubiquitous. I agree that original paintings are being neglected while usual ones are being praised. In this essay, I will discuss why I believe this is the case.Firstly, the superficial nature of humans is responsible for this change. Humans have a tendency to be drawn to artwork that is visually appealing, rather than intellectually stimulating. As a result, many artists prioritize creating pieces that are aesthetically pleasing, rather than pushing the boundaries of creativity and innovation. This has led to a proliferation of ordinary, yet visually attractive, artworks being labelled as ""masterpieces"". For instance, the work of artists such as Jeff Koons, whose balloon dogs and other sculptures are often praised for their visual appeal, rather than their depth or originality.Furthermore, the art world has become increasingly commercialized, with many artists creating work with the sole intention of selling it, rather than creating something truly original and meaningful. This has led to a homogenization of art, where unique and innovative pieces are overlooked in favour of more mainstream, and therefore more marketable, artworks. The result is that true works of art, which challenge our perceptions and push the boundaries of creativity, are passing unnoticed, while substandard artworks are being praised and sold for exorbitant prices. Ultimately, I believe that the decline in the quality of prize-winning artwork is a result of the superficial nature of humans and the commercialization of the art world, and that original paintings are being neglected in favour of more ordinary, yet visually appealing, pieces."
1338;Today children are spending much more time watching TV compared to the past. Why do you think this happens? Is this a positive or a negative change?;"A trend has emerged in the last two decades with youngsters watching more TV than ever before. One of the main reasons behind this issue is the recent advancements in technology in gaming and film industries. This tendency has both pros and cons, and will be further discussed in this essay.The latest developments in video game consoles attracted both children and adults to spend extra time watching TV, compared to the past. With interactive gaming characters and high quality graphics, children are more likely to spend long hours playing games in front of the TV. A recent survey showed that TV addiction among young people, for example, has significantly increased from 5% to 80%, which was supposedly caused by the introduction of advanced gaming consoles. This increase is also partially due to films, drama series and cartoons being easily available on pirated websites and various gaming platforms.This trend has had more negative than positive effects on young citizens. More time spent watching TV adversely affects the mental and physical wellbeing of a child. For instance, the obesity ratio among young individuals in the past 10 years has risen dramatically; this has caused further health problems such as anxiety and depression. However, TV can also be used in a positive way. It is a great source of information that can help youngsters increase their knowledge and succeed in their future careers.In conclusion, recent breakthroughs in technology are driving up the amount of time our youngsters are spending in front of their TV screens. This can do more harm than good if we don’t regulate the use of TV, but parents have the power to make TV time useful and beneficial for their children.";In recent years, a trend has emerged in the last two decades with youngsters watching more TV than ever before. This shift in behavior has sparked concerns among parents, educators, and health experts. One of the main reasons behind this issue is the recent advancements in technology in gaming and film industries. The production of high-quality, engaging content has made TV a more appealing and accessible form of entertainment for children. With the rise of streaming services and on-demand TV, kids can now watch their favorite shows and movies at any time, making it easier for them to spend hours in front of the screen.As a result, TV addiction among young people has become a significant problem. A recent survey showed that TV addiction among young people has significantly increased from  to 80%, a staggering rise of 75%. This is a worrying trend, as excessive TV watching has been linked to a range of negative effects, including obesity, decreased attention span, and decreased physical activity. Furthermore, excessive TV watching can also lead to a decline in academic performance and social skills.Overall, the increase in TV watching among children is a negative change. While TV can be a valuable source of education and entertainment, excessive watching can have serious consequences for a child's physical and mental health. Parents, educators, and policymakers must work together to promote healthy viewing habits and encourage children to engage in other activities, such as outdoor play, reading, and socializing. By doing so, we can help children develop a balanced and active lifestyle, and mitigate the negative effects of excessive TV watching.
603;Today family members do not eat meals together. Why does this happen? Is this a positive or negative developmentGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Dinner tables are no longer a place for family reunion in today's society. Reasons from many aspects account for this phenomenon which pose a huge threat to the happiness of family and the harmony of society.Causes vary from person to person. Some people, especially the young believing that conflicts are common on dinner tables, tend to have meals with their friends rather than their family members. But most people are deprived of their rights by the development of society. Too busy to get home at dinner time, people have to eat meals near workplace. Also, with the job diversity increasing, rarely can family members with different timetables eat meals at the same period. For instance, a bank agent getting home at 6 pm tends to miss her doctor husband leaving home at 5 pm for emergency work.It is the advantages of sharing meals with family that attach great importance to this event. Time for communication is so critical that families lacking such opportunities are often full of misunderstandings and quarrels. Not only can this development increase the divorce rate but it may also decrease the marriage rate. Because support and care from family, the previous harbor, is deprived and people see no significance from getting married. With such phenomenon prevailing, the negative emotions may take advantage in the society. Loneliness, distress and helplessness stike those always eating alone.In a nutshell, taking the damage to both families and societies into consideration, various solutions should be put forward to the roots behind the situation.;The traditional family dinner table, where loved ones gathered to share meals and stories, is now a rare sight in today's society. Dinner tables are no longer a place for family reunion, as family members increasingly eat meals separately. This phenomenon can be attributed to various reasons from many aspects, which pose a huge threat to the happiness of family and the harmony of society.One major reason is the hectic pace of modern life, where individuals have demanding work schedules and extracurricular activities, leaving little time for family meals. Additionally, the rise of digital technology has led to a decline in face-to-face interactions, as family members often eat in front of screens, watching TV or scrolling through their phones. Furthermore, the increasing trend of single-parent households and dual-income families has resulted in less time and energy for cooking and sharing meals together.This development is undoubtedly negative, as it erodes the foundation of family bonding and social skills. Eating together provides an opportunity for family members to connect, share experiences, and strengthen relationships. Without this regular interaction, family members can become isolated and disconnected, leading to a decline in emotional support and communication. For instance, in my own experience, I have noticed that when my family eats together, we are more likely to discuss our daily lives, share our feelings, and resolve conflicts. In contrast, when we eat separately, we tend to become disconnected and less aware of each other's needs and struggles.In conclusion, the disappearance of family meals is a disturbing trend that undermines the happiness and harmony of families and society as a whole. It is essential for families to prioritize mealtime together, putting away distractions and fostering meaningful conversations. By doing so, we can revitalize the traditional dinner table as a hub for family reunion and strengthen the bonds that hold us together.
883;Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;There is no doubt that nowadays advertising plays a very strong role in saling goods. The high rate of sales does not always mean the real needs of some goods. In this essay, i will discuss both views and draw my personal conclusion.In terms of advertising's power in increasing sales of popular consumer goods, advertising has an essencial role these days in sales. The main reason given to support this claim is advertisnig attracts people and inform people about the new and special products in a very special way. To illustrate, using social media for marketing and advertising raise sales dramatecly. People spend most of their times to watch what is in the social media and that means social media is the best way to do your marketing.However, some people say that people buy these products not because they really need them but because they like the way that was used to advertise these products. On the other hand, some times people purchase goods because they have seen them or heard about them from others or from the social media not due to their needs of these products.In conclusion, I believe that increasing the sales of some popular consumer goods show how strong is advertising and how advertising plays a crucial role in saling products. Also, smart business owners should think about advertising as a fast way to sale their goods. As was previously menthond, people can be attracted by all kinds of advertising and that definitly lead to increasing the sale rate.;The impact of advertising on consumer behavior has become a topic of significant discussion in recent years. Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do I agree or disagree with this statement?There is no doubt that nowadays advertising plays a very strong role in selling goods. Advertisers use various tactics to attract customers, from social media influencers to catchy slogans, making their products seem indispensable. As a result, the sales of these goods skyrocket, creating an illusion of high demand. However, the high rate of sales does not always mean that the real needs of some goods are being met. In many cases, people purchase products due to the persuasive power of advertising rather than an actual need for the product.In this essay, I will discuss both views and draw my personal conclusion. On one hand, it can be argued that advertising does indeed drive sales, and this, in turn, boosts the economy. Companies invest heavily in advertising, which creates jobs and stimulates economic growth. On the other hand, critics argue that advertising creates artificial needs, leading to unnecessary consumption and waste. This can have negative consequences on the environment and society as a whole.In conclusion, while advertising undoubtedly plays a significant role in driving sales, I believe that it is a mix of both the power of advertising and real needs that contribute to high sales. However, it is essential for consumers to be aware of the tactics used by advertisers and make informed purchasing decisions that meet their genuine needs, rather than blindly following the crowd. By being mindful of our consumption habits, we can promote a more sustainable and responsible marketplace.
1328;Today’s young generation is facing many problems at school and at home. What are the problems? What can parents do to help their teenage children?;"Young people today are under a lot of pressure, which seems to come from many directions. The problems they are experiencing happen not only at school, but also at home, and it seems that without adult guidance, our young generation will continue to struggle.Teenage years have never been simple, and many would agree that the amount of challenges has only increased with the passage of time. Bullying has been a problem for quite a while, and children and adolescents would have experienced it at school in the past, but then it would stop at home. At present, however, things have been made worse by social media penetrating the supposedly safe space of our teenagers. The unfortunate behaviour of their peers can now reach them even in their bedrooms, causing them constant distress.Another issue troubling many young people is the pressure to succeed by their families. Whether at school or at home, they often feel as if they are not smart enough, which creates overwhelm and despair. Understandably, their parents are pursuing a worthy goal of ensuring their children get a great start in life; however, many teens feel that they are failing their families when they don’t live up to their expectations. This often leads to dishonest and unethical behaviour, such as cheating on tests or plagiarising other students’ work. When uncovered, these incidents have a profound effect on young people’s future careers, not to mention their emotional well-being.It is hard to underestimate the importance of parental support to navigating life as a young person. From helping teens build a positive body image and self-esteem, to handling classmates’ difficult behaviour, to guidance where study is concerned, parents can make a world of difference. Talking to their sons and daughters about matters that worry them, listening and making non-judgmental suggestions are great ways to help. Getting a professional involved where necessary and engaging with teachers, councilors and coaches is another opportunity for parents to provide assistance. Last but not least, parents can make their children better and happier people by simply giving them unconditional love.To sum up, being a young person in the modern world isn’t easy. By banding together and paying careful attention to their teens, families can help them overcome any obstacles to becoming successful adults.";The young generation of today is facing a multitude of problems that affect their well-being and development. Young people today are under a lot of pressure, which seems to come from many directions. The academic demands, social expectations, and personal aspirations all contribute to a sense of overwhelm and stress. The problems they are experiencing happen not only at school, where they are expected to excel academically and socially, but also at home, where family dynamics and personal relationships can be a source of conflict and anxiety.At school, teenagers face pressures to perform well on exams, maintain a good grade point average, and navigate complex social relationships. Meanwhile, at home, they may struggle with family conflicts, parental expectations, and personal issues such as self-esteem and body image concerns. These problems can have a significant impact on a teenager's mental and emotional health, leading to issues such as anxiety, depression, and low self-confidence.However, by banding together and paying careful attention to their teens, families can help them overcome any obstacles to becoming successful adults. Parents can play a crucial role in supporting their teenage children by being approachable, available, and understanding. They can encourage open communication, listen to their concerns, and offer guidance and support when needed. By doing so, parents can help their teenagers develop the resilience, coping skills, and self-awareness necessary to navigate the challenges of adolescence and thrive in their future endeavors. Ultimately, it is through the collaborative efforts of families, schools, and communities that young people can receive the support and guidance they need to overcome their problems and reach their full potential.
1310;Tourism today creates a variety of problems, such as pollution due to flights, transport and dirty water.Do you think that governments should impose extra taxes on flights or accommodation to restrict today’s tourism industry?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Travelling today is simple to the extent that within twelve hours one can travel from Europe to Singapore, crossing nearly the whole globe. Based on this simplicity, tourism has changed significantly over the years. While in the past a family would be proud to drive two hours to a lake, many families now think nothing of travelling to the far side of the world. This also has a downside as increased pollution is a result. Extra taxes on flights or accommodation have therefore been offered as a solution so as to increase the cost of tourism and reduce its popularity.No matter what major transportation is used, travelling creates pollution. To decrease the amount of pollution caused by tourism, the tourism industry itself would have to be weakened. If these increased taxes are based on travelling distance, people would be more willing to stay closer to their home country, as for many even a slight increase would mean that their planned holidays would be too expensive. Accommodation taxes would raise holiday costs no matter the distance travelled. Therefore, if increased taxes were levied on travel and accommodation, tourism and therefore pollution would decrease.On the other hand, the main transport methods that would be impacted by imposing extra taxes would be communal ones, such as planes, trains and buses, and increasing the taxes would also impact non-tourists. Also, holidays are a vital part of ordinary people’s lives, as they escape from work and stress, and get to spend valuable time with their families. Stopping people travelling would greatly impact some simple pleasures of ordinary life.In conclusion, while tourism impacts the environment significantly, simply introducing extra taxes on transport or accommodation is a drastic measure. It could be more valuable to change the methods of transportation to decrease pollution, instead making people stay close to home.;The tourism industry has become a significant contributor to economic growth, but it also poses numerous environmental challenges, such as pollution from flights, transportation, and contaminated water. To mitigate these issues, some propose that governments impose extra taxes on flights or accommodation to restrict the industry's growth. This approach aims to increase the cost of tourism, thereby reducing its popularity and subsequent environmental impact.Proponents of this solution argue that by making tourism more expensive, the number of travelers would decrease, leading to a reduction in pollution. For instance, if increased taxes were levied on travel and accommodation, tourism would likely decrease, as travelers would be deterred by the higher costs. This, in turn, would lead to a decrease in the amount of pollution caused by tourism. However, it is essential to acknowledge that to decrease the amount of pollution caused by tourism, the tourism industry itself would have to be weakened.Extra taxes on flights or accommodation have been offered as a solution to increase the cost of tourism and reduce its popularity. This strategy could be effective, as it would discourage people from traveling, thereby reducing the strain on the environment. Nevertheless, it is crucial to consider the potential economic implications of such a policy, as the tourism industry is a significant source of revenue and employment for many countries.In conclusion, while imposing extra taxes on flights or accommodation may be a viable solution to mitigate the environmental problems caused by tourism, it is essential to weigh the potential benefits against the potential economic drawbacks. A balanced approach that considers both environmental and economic factors is necessary to ensure that the tourism industry develops in a sustainable manner. By adopting such an approach, governments can work towards reducing the negative environmental impacts of tourism while still supporting the economic benefits it provides.
1229;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;While some people argue that equal numbers of male and female students should be accepted in every major, I personally disagree with this statement.There are a number of arguments that can support my stance. To begin with, it is impossible to enroll equal genders of students in every subject. It is true that some faculties are underrepresented by a particular gender. For example, STEM subjects usually have more male students than females, but the opposite is true in educational-related subjects, which phenomenon seems to violate the principle that we fight endeavor today, gender equality. Therefore, people want to accept equal numbers of students to achieve a gender balance in every subject. However, the reality is that different genders prefer to study different subjects themselves, but not because of the unequal opportunity. According to one of the research, women show a higher interest in subjects like education, psychology and arts rather than science-related subjects. As a result, it is apparent that admitting equivalent proportions of male and female students can hardly be achieved.In addition, it will deprive students of chances to make their own choices if universities enroll both genders equally in every subject mandatorily. It should be noted that it is students' right to select the subjects freely in college. If students cannot register for the subjects they want to study just because there are not enough quotas left for particular gender of students, or they are forced to study some subjects they are not interested in just because they need to fulfill the gender requirement in the class, it will hinder students' learning in the long-run.To conclude, universities should not enroll equal gender students in every subject as it is impossible to achieve and may deprive students the freedom to choose the major they want to study.;The issue of whether universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject has sparked a heated debate. Some people argue that equal numbers of male and female students should be accepted in every major, as this would promote fairness and equality. However, I disagree with this statement to a great extent.In reality, it is impossible to enroll equal genders of students in every subject. Different genders tend to have different interests and preferences when it comes to choosing a major. For instance, traditionally male-dominated fields such as engineering and computer science tend to attract more male students, while female-dominated fields such as nursing and education tend to attract more female students. This is not because of unequal opportunities, but rather because different genders prefer to study different subjects themselves.Furthermore, enforcing equal numbers of male and female students in every subject could lead to a situation where some students are admitted to programs that do not align with their interests or strengths. This would not only hinder their academic performance but also limit their career opportunities. For example, if a university were to accept a certain number of female students into a male-dominated engineering program simply to meet a quota, it may set those students up for failure if they are not genuinely interested in the subject.In conclusion, while the idea of accepting equal numbers of male and female students in every subject may seem appealing, it is not a practical or fair solution. Universities should focus on providing equal opportunities for all students to pursue their interests and passions, rather than trying to enforce equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. By doing so, we can ensure that students are able to reach their full potential and succeed in their chosen fields.
1433;Universities should allocate the same amount of money to their sport activities as they allocate to their libraries. Do you agree or disagree?;Yes, I do feel that universities should have an equal budget for their libraries as well as sport activities. It is our general belief that a good player can not be good student and hence we restrict our children’s sport activities at college level. Moreover, an academic degree has much more value than sport activities which naturally compels students to focus more on their studies than their interest in sport.Most of the universities keep sports at of their priority list, good players do not get enough facilities and to improve their skills and eventually they their interest.Universities can play substantial role in shaping this upcoming talent by providing good trainers and which is otherwise too expensive to afford. Also it will attract other students sports and inculcate importance of physical fitness in them.Universities should produce in all fields rather than only concentrating on progress of scholars. Hence, I feel that universities should allot equal amounts of money to as well as sport activities.;I strongly agree that universities should allocate the same amount of money to their sport activities as they allocate to their libraries. For a long time, it has been our general belief that a good player cannot be a good student, and hence, we often restrict our children's sport activities at the college level. However, this misconception has led to an imbalance in the allocation of resources in universities, with libraries often receiving a larger share of the budget.It is essential to recognize that sports and physical activities are just as important as academic pursuits. Engaging in sports can help students develop valuable skills such as teamwork, leadership, and time management, which are complementary to academic learning. Moreover, research has shown that students who participate in sports tend to perform better academically and have better mental health.By allocating an equal budget to sport activities as to libraries, universities can promote a more holistic approach to education. This would enable students to explore their interests in both academics and sports, leading to a more balanced and well-rounded education. Furthermore, it would also help to break down the stereotype that a good player cannot be a good student, and instead, encourage students to pursue their passions in both areas.In conclusion, allocating the same amount of money to sport activities as to libraries is essential for promoting a balanced and inclusive education system. It would allow students to develop their physical and mental abilities, while also pursuing academic excellence. By doing so, universities can help to foster a new generation of well-rounded individuals who excel in both sports and academics.
1387;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;Today computers are used almost everywhere, it is impossible to imagine our life without PCs, Internet, mobile phones and other computer devices. It is reasonable to think that people look forward to the future of computers., computers make our life easier, we can easily get information about any product we plan to buy or place we plan to visit in a second using a personal computer and . Scientists predict that in the nearest future it will be possible to smell a new perfume using the Internet and watch 3D scenes at home like we do in the movie theater. According to forecasts of HR agencies machines will replace jobs of cashiers, and civil and military pilots. Some corporations in Japan are already sellinghousewife-robots, which help old people to keep their homes clean.Despite the fact that computers help us, they make us dependent. Apparently, people spend more time behind monitors than ever before. And some of them feel a need for more time to be spent with people in live contact. In addition, a breakdown of one of the important modules of a specific computer can entail serious consequences. to mention the computer problem that occurred in the end of 1990s, a problem related to the coming year 2000 (Y2K) and catastrophes that were predicted. Fortunately imminent disasters did not happen. However, it is difficult to imagine what could if all the predictions came true.We live in a technological era, computers penetrated everywhere with all benefits they provide and all dangers they hide. However we are satisfied with them and sometimes we even thank them because they help us in communicating, studying, doing business, entertaining and saving lives in critical situations.;The world is rapidly becoming increasingly reliant on computers, and their applications are expanding into various aspects of our lives. Currently, computers are utilized in business, crime detection, and even in flying planes. As technology advances, it is intriguing to consider the potential future uses of computers. Scientists predict that in the near future, it will be possible to smell a new perfume using the Internet and watch 3D scenes at home with the same quality as in a movie theater. This suggests that computers will revolutionize the way we experience and interact with the world around us.Furthermore, according to forecasts by HR agencies, machines are expected to replace jobs such as cashiers, and civil and military pilots. While this may bring about increased efficiency and accuracy, it also raises concerns about job security and the potential for widespread unemployment. On one hand, the dependence on computers can be seen as a positive development, as it can lead to improved productivity, enhanced safety, and unprecedented access to information and entertainment.On the other hand, this growing reliance on computers also warrants a degree of skepticism. As we become more dependent on technology, we may be vulnerable to cyber threats, data breaches, and the potential for machines to malfunction or be used for malicious purposes. Moreover, the loss of human jobs to automation could have far-reaching social and economic consequences. In conclusion, while computers will undoubtedly continue to play an increasingly prominent role in our lives, it is essential to approach this trend with a balanced perspective, acknowledging both the benefits and the potential risks associated with our growing dependence on technology.
1396;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in the future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;In the last two decades cybernetics have experienced a major breakthrough .This led to the utilization of computers in nearly all parts of our daily life, from personal computers to the ones performing complicated surgeries. Surely the uptake of this technology facilitates a lot of difficult tasks but is this excessive ripping the warmth out of our lives? .Most of the daily tasks individual experiences are time and effort consuming. These two qualities could be tremendously saved by the use of computers. The average period required to prepare a decent meal for a middle-class family is around an hour to hour and a half when using traditional methods. This time could be literally reduced to half if computerized are used instead. Moreover, a busy businessman is enabled to easily close a profitable deal with just a touch highly programmed laptop while enjoying his family vacation and not having to exert an extra effort of traveling long distances in order to a deal.On the other hand, new generations are growing remarkably dependent on these modern utilities, which makes them handicapped when it comes to a cup of tea. , psychologists suggest that one of the main reasons for rate increase is the recent electric inventions. This is due to the fact that humans by nature stay emotionally healthy through socializing, but due to the importance of modern technology to maintain a financially satisfying standard of life they gradually themselves. As time passes by each of these individuals gets stuck in a vicious circle of loneliness that eventually leads to suicidal attempts especially among youngsters.In conclusion, similarly to every other invention computers have their benefits and drawbacks, I personally think it all depends upon how we use the given tools . Moderation is the key here to keep the balance and allow us to live in harmony.;The world is rapidly becoming reliant on computers, with their applications spanning across various sectors such as business, healthcare, crime detection, and transportation. In the future, it is likely that computers will be integrated into even more aspects of our lives, making tasks more efficient and streamlined. For instance, a busy businessman is enabled to easily close a profitable deal with just a touch of his highly programmed laptop, demonstrating the significant impact of technology on productivity.Furthermore, computers have the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work. With advancements in artificial intelligence and automation, the average period required to prepare a decent meal for a middle-class family, which currently stands at around an hour to hour and a half when using traditional methods, could be significantly reduced. This would not only save time but also increase the quality of life for many individuals.However, this growing dependence on computers also raises concerns. On the other hand, new generations are growing remarkably dependent on these modern utilities, which makes them handicapped when it comes to basic tasks, such as making a cup of tea. This over-reliance on technology could lead to a loss of traditional skills and a decrease in self-sufficiency. Therefore, while computers have the potential to greatly improve our lives, it is essential to maintain a balance between technology use and traditional skills, ensuring that we do not become too reliant on them. By doing so, we can harness the benefits of computers while also preserving our ability to perform tasks independently. Ultimately, a balanced approach to technology use is crucial for a healthy and sustainable future.
1348;When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers (agree/disagree);When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers for people to spend their free time. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Sample EssaySome people argue that town planners should have a preference for more parks and gyms to be created than business districts and shopping malls. While I understand the concerns of people who hold this opinion, it seems to me that shopping centers are just as important as parks and gyms in a town.There are reasons why public facilities are crucial to city inhabitants. First of all, they provide suitable spaces and equipment for people to exercise. For example, people can go jogging in the park and play tennis or basketball at the sports stadium. That helps to keep their bodies fit and it also elevates their mood during the day. Besides, parks and sports facilities are good spots for people to socialize with their neighbors. People can connect with others when they are playing sports or talking casually with passers by in the park. A harmonious relationship between residents helps build a caring and friendly neighborhood.Although parks and gyms give the town dwellers all kinds of benefits, I would like to point out the importance of shopping malls to the district. Firstly, a shopping center could make shopping more convenient for the local residents. It would enable them to easily purchase things in town and transport them home with less effort and at lower cost. They would not need to spend extra money on transportation or shipping of the goods. Secondly, a shopping mall can provide employment. Locals can find work in retail, maintenance or security of the mall, hence earning an income to support their families.In conclusion, although parks and sports facilities serve as places for exercise and social activities for city dwellers, I believe that shopping centers are equally important, since they can provide job opportunities and convenience to the town residents.This essay would score well on Task Achievement because it addresses all parts of the question, discusses reasons for and against building more parks than shopping malls and expresses the opinion of the writer. The main ideas are organized well and explained coherently. The range of vocabulary is adequate for the requirements of the task response. Overall, this essay could get Band 8 in IELTS.;When new towns are planned, the allocation of space for various amenities is a crucial consideration. In my opinion, I strongly agree that it is essential to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers. This prioritization is vital for the well-being and quality of life of the town's residents.Firstly, public parks and sports facilities provide spaces for people to spend their free time engaging in physical activities, recreational pursuits, and social interactions. These areas foster a sense of community, promote physical health, and offer mental relaxation. In contrast, shopping centers, although important for economic activity, can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and contribute to environmental degradation if over-emphasized. By building more parks and sports facilities, residents are encouraged to adopt healthier lifestyles and enjoy the outdoors, which is essential for a balanced life.Moreover, building more public parks than shopping centers can also have long-term environmental benefits. Green spaces help in absorbing carbon dioxide, producing oxygen, and reducing the urban heat island effect, thus improving the overall air quality and climate of the town. This ecological advantage is significant, especially in the context of growing concerns about climate change and urban sustainability.While it is undeniable that shopping centers are necessary for the economic viability of a town, I believe that striking a balance where public parks and sports facilities are prioritized can lead to a more holistic development of the community. Residents will have ample opportunities to engage in leisure activities, enjoy nature, and maintain their physical and mental health, all of which are fundamental to the happiness and productivity of the populace.In conclusion, when planning new towns, it is indeed important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers. This approach ensures that the residents have access to spaces that promote their overall well-being, contribute to environmental sustainability, and foster community spirit. By prioritizing green and recreational spaces, new towns can be designed to be more livable, sustainable, and enjoyable for their inhabitants.
47;While many people go to university for academic study, more people should be encouraged to do vocational training because there is a lack of qualified workers such as electricians and plumbers. Do you agree or disagree?;Some believe that people should be encouraged more to study practical courses than going to university to fulfill the lack of workforce in practical areas. I agree with this proposal to some degree, because, from my knowledge, there is a lack in both fields, academic and vocational experts. Moreover, academic studies and vocational ones are equally important for every society, and not everybody can study the same thing, so both studies should be encouraged.Qualified workers and professional academics are equally needed in many parts of the world. This is because as the population grows the people's needs do it too, and this happens in all shapes and areas. While living in Argentina, I noticed the need of professionals in fields such as medicine and technology, especially robotics. In England, however, I observed the lack of plumers and carpenters. Consequently, every country needs different things.Furthermore, if strong encouragement is put on studying vocational courses only, this could be detrimental to the academic field. Essentially, both study systems are equally important. A hospital needs doctors to treat people as well as electricians to maintain the building. Besides, not everybody is good at everything. Some might be good at performing practical tasks and some good at thinking. In my family, I am the one who studied at the university, but my sister studied dressmaking. Both of us have jobs nowadays.In conclusion, I believe that the two types of studies should be stimulated. Countries worldwide are in lack of different experts, either in the vocational or academic field, hence, both workers are equally essential and needed. Besides and more importantly, not every individual can study the same subject or perform in the same area.;The notion that more people should be encouraged to pursue vocational training over academic study at university has gained significant attention in recent years. Proponents of this idea argue that there is a shortage of skilled workers, such as electricians and plumbers, and that vocational training can help fill this gap. However, I disagree with the idea that people should be solely encouraged to pursue practical courses over academic study.While it is true that there is a lack of qualified workers in certain practical areas, it is also important to note that there is a shortage of experts in academic fields. Both academic and vocational fields require skilled and knowledgeable professionals to drive innovation and progress. Moreover, every individual has unique strengths, interests, and abilities, and it is unrealistic to expect that everyone can excel in the same area. Some people may be more inclined towards theoretical and academic pursuits, while others may be more suited to practical and hands-on training.Rather than prioritizing one over the other, I believe that both academic study and vocational training should be valued and encouraged. By providing opportunities and resources for individuals to pursue their interests and strengths, we can work towards addressing the shortages in both fields. Ultimately, it is crucial to recognize and respect the diversity of human abilities and interests, and to provide a range of educational and training pathways that cater to different needs and goals. By doing so, we can ensure that we have a well-rounded and skilled workforce that can drive progress and innovation in all areas.
1380;Why do criminals commit another offence after being punished?;"Many offenders commit more crimes after serving the first punishment. Why is this happening, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?It is true that some criminals commit crimes again after they have been punished. While there are several reasons for this alarming trend, some effective measures can be taken by governments to tackle this problem.There are two main reasons for re-offenders. Firstly, the prison system can make the situation worse. Criminals put together in prison and they make friends with other offenders. While they are locked up in prison, they do not have much to do there, and they would exchange information about what they have done before they came to the prison or they may plan crimes with other inmates. Secondly, offenders often do not have any other means of earning money. They are poor, uneducated and lacking skills needed to maintain a job. Also, a criminal record makes finding a job difficult as people usually avoid hiring .To solve this problem, governments should focus on rehabilitation of criminals rather than punishment. Above all, prisons need vocational training which inmates to prepare for life outside the prison. They can learn practical skills such as computer programming, car maintenance and graphic design. In this way, they can be hired for a position that requires this certain knowledge and skills. Community service is another way to reform offenders. Rather than being locked up in prison with other inmates, offenders can help society and become useful to their local community, and these activities would eliminate the negative influence that prisons can have.In conclusion, it is true the one of the problems our community; it can be solved by focusing rather than punishment itself.This is a good essay. The requirements of the task statement are covered, the reasoning is logical and presented in a coherent, easy to follow way, the range of vocabulary is wide enough and the writer shows fluency and flexibility. Some minor errors in this essay include word choice and preposition errors (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows suggested corrections). Overall this looks like an IELTS Band 8 essay.";The recurrence of criminal behavior among offenders after serving their initial punishment is a pervasive issue that plagues the justice system. Many offenders commit more crimes after being released from prison, raising questions about the effectiveness of the current punitive measures. This phenomenon can be attributed to several factors, including the prison system itself and the socioeconomic conditions of the offenders.Firstly, the prison system can exacerbate the problem. By congregating criminals in a single institution, prisons inadvertently create an environment where offenders can form alliances and learn from one another. This can lead to the exchange of ideas and techniques, potentially escalating the severity or frequency of criminal activities upon release. The lack of effective rehabilitation programs within prisons further compounds the issue, as offenders may not receive the necessary support or skills to lead a law-abiding life.Secondly, many offenders are driven to crime due to socioeconomic desperation. Often, they are poor, uneducated, and lacking the skills required to maintain employment. Without a legitimate means of earning a living, these individuals may resort to criminal activities as a survival mechanism. This cycle of poverty and crime is difficult to break, especially when coupled with the stigma of a criminal record, which can further limit job opportunities.To tackle this problem, it is essential to implement measures that address both the prison environment and the socioeconomic realities of offenders. This could include enhancing rehabilitation programs within prisons, such as vocational training, education, and counseling, to equip offenders with the skills and mindset necessary for a law-abiding life. Additionally, initiatives that provide support and resources for offenders upon release, such as job placement services, housing assistance, and mentorship programs, could help alleviate the economic pressures that drive recidivism. By adopting a more holistic approach to criminal justice, focusing on rehabilitation and reintegration rather than mere punishment, we can work towards reducing the rates of repeat offending and fostering safer, more resilient communities.
1400;With all the problems in the world today, spending money on space exploration is a complete waste. The money could be better spent on other causes.;, every day, every year, celebrates its achievements in space exploration. However, it is now the time to question how meaningful these blasts are.First, until all urgent and important matters of the globe have been solved, money on space exploration is meaningless. It at all to invest millions of dollars researching and producing foods for astronauts (for space exploration purpose), while every day thousands of people are starving. Furthermore, the discovery of outer space only serves a minor group of people if the majority well-educated. do no even know how to prevent common threatening diseases such as AIDS and lung cancer.Then, some may argue that the purpose of space exploration to discover new lands, new energy resources or to deter potential threat to . Nevertheless, is it effective to do so while other alternatives are available? yet effectively used. New energy resources (e.g. solar and nuclear energy) have not yet been widely-used. Threats of plagues have not yet been deterred. All of these tasks that haven’t been tackled yet require money. That is why costly space discovery programs are a waste of resources.In a nutshell, people should only invest in space exploration provided that urgent and important matters mentioned earlier in this essay have been solved. Also, purposes of space exploration campaigns should be studied carefully and other alternatives should be considered before the money is wasted.;The world is plagued by numerous problems, from poverty and hunger to climate change and inequality. In this context, the idea of spending billions of dollars on space exploration seems frivolous. Every day, we are reminded of the pressing issues that need our attention and resources. Every year, the space community celebrates its achievements in space exploration. However, it is now the time to question how meaningful these blasts are.While space exploration has led to numerous breakthroughs and advancements, it is difficult to justify the allocation of funds to this endeavor when there are more pressing concerns on our planet. Until all urgent and important matters of the globe have been solved, money spent on space exploration is, in essence, meaningless. The resources devoted to space travel and research could be better utilized to address the basic needs of humanity, such as food, shelter, healthcare, and education.Moreover, the problems we face on Earth, such as environmental degradation, social inequality, and economic disparities, require immediate attention and funding. It is our responsibility to prioritize the well-being of our planet and its inhabitants before pursuing ambitions in outer space. By redirecting the funds allocated to space exploration towards solving these pressing issues, we can create a more equitable and sustainable world. In conclusion, while space exploration has its merits, it is crucial that we reassess our priorities and focus on solving the problems that affect us all, before venturing into the unknown. Only when we have ensured the well-being of our planet and its people, can we justify the expense of exploring the vastness of space.
1312;With the increase in computer use, many people feel that schools do not need to put the emphasis that they used to on basic handwriting skills or mental mathematics skills.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;In recent years, computer use around the world has increased drastically. As a result technological equipment is used increasingly in schools around the world. Many people question therefore whether schools should put much emphasis on teaching students basic handwriting skills and mental mathematics skills.The use of technological equipment in lessons has increased since the onset of the digital age. Nearly all professions around the world involve computer use and even the simplest tasks are carried out via electronic equipment. Hence, it is important for students to learn how to use technology correctly for their future careers. Electronic devices also offer various learning advantages, as notes and assignments can be completed much faster and more neatly using these tools.Nonetheless, the practical skills such as using and holding a pen correctly are likewise vital for future careers. For that reason, students have to be taught at early ages how to carry out simple tasks using basic skills, such as writing. It is also essential that a student develops neat handwriting, as in the case of a technological problem the student will have to write by hand. Furthermore, final exams are typically written by hand and thus the student must develop the basic skill of holding a pen and writing with it. Mathematics skills are no different. People will not always have a device with them to carry out calculations and the ability to do arithmetic in the head is a vital skill for operating in today’s world.In conclusion, I personally believe that schools should keep a balance between using practical skills and using electronic equipment to carry out certain tasks by having student submit assignments created electronically, yet also by having them complete assignments by hand in class and without computers or calculators. This balance is important, as if the focus lies only on one of the two aspects, the student will face problems later on in life.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way we live, work, and learn. In recent years, computer use around the world has increased drastically, leading to a significant shift in the way educational institutions operate. As a result, technological equipment is used increasingly in schools, making many people question whether schools should put much emphasis on teaching students basic handwriting skills and mental mathematics skills. While I understand the argument that technology can perform these tasks efficiently, I disagree that schools should diminish their focus on these fundamental skills.Basic handwriting skills and mental mathematics skills are essential for cognitive development, problem-solving, and critical thinking. Handwriting, in particular, has been shown to improve retention, memory, and comprehension. Moreover, research suggests that students who practice handwriting tend to perform better in reading and writing tests. Similarly, mental mathematics skills enhance numerical understanding, estimation, and logical reasoning. These skills are not only useful in everyday life but also in various professions, where technology may not always be available or reliable.Furthermore, over-reliance on technology can lead to a lack of understanding of underlying concepts. For instance, a student who uses a calculator to perform mathematical operations may not comprehend the mathematical principles behind the calculation. Additionally, in situations where technology fails or is not accessible, individuals with strong foundational skills in handwriting and mental mathematics can adapt and respond effectively.In conclusion, while technology is an indispensable tool in modern education, I firmly believe that schools should continue to emphasize basic handwriting skills and mental mathematics skills. These skills are fundamental to cognitive development, problem-solving, and critical thinking, and their importance should not be underestimated in the face of increasing technological advancements. By striking a balance between technology use and traditional teaching methods, schools can equip students with a comprehensive education that prepares them for an ever-evolving world.
1303;With the scale of globalisation today, it would be of unquestioned benefit to have a single world currency.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Globalisation has become a significant aspect of the world’s modern economy, with countless industries and businesses expanding in various countries. This has led to the debate of developing a world currency with many people believing it could drastically help further develop economies and assist in the development of many countries.A worldwide currency could bring on effects similar to when Euro was developed for Europe. Trade could be significantly encouraged, as there would be no exchange rate fluctuation risks between different currencies. Moreover, tourists would not need to exchange money when travelling.However, there are certain risks to a global currency, which definitely do not make it an “unquestioned benefit”. Countries in debt would not be able to lower their currency value to make consumer goods more desirable, which could develop into a severe economic issue. For example, the US regulated its interest rates to increase the money resources in order to diminish the effect of a recent recession. Also economic problems, such as in Greece, have actually been made worse by the use of the common Euro. If applied worldwide, many countries’ economies could be very similarly negatively impacted. Finally, many countries around the world do not have a stable enough economy to be able to enter a common currency. If weaker countries were to adopt a world currency, this could be disastrous to their economy and to the economies of other countries using the same currency.In conclusion, the extent to which a global currency would be beneficial is quite low. It seems to me that the risks outweigh the benefits, as if a country were to lose economic stability, the world would be impacted as well. For that reason, I feel that in present circumstances, it is best to have separate currencies to protect countries from economic recession.;The notion of a single world currency has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly with the increasing scale of globalization. The idea is that a worldwide currency would facilitate international trade, investment, and economic cooperation, thereby promoting global economic growth and stability. However, I disagree that having a single world currency would be of unquestioned benefit.Globalisation has indeed led to the debate of developing a world currency, with proponents arguing that it would simplify international transactions, reduce exchange rate risks, and increase economic efficiency. A worldwide currency could bring on effects similar to when the Euro was developed, which has facilitated trade and investment within the European Union. The Euro has eliminated the need for currency exchange among member states, reduced transaction costs, and increased price transparency.However, there are certain risks to a global currency, which definitely do not make it an “unquestioned benefit”. One of the primary concerns is that countries in debt would not be able to lower their currency value to make their consumer goods more desirable, thereby losing a crucial tool for managing their trade balance. This could lead to a decline in their competitiveness, making it even harder for them to pay off their debts. Additionally, a single world currency would also mean that countries would have to surrender their monetary policy independence, making it difficult for them to respond to domestic economic conditions.In conclusion, while a single world currency may have some benefits, such as simplifying international transactions and increasing economic efficiency, it also poses significant risks, particularly for countries with high debt levels. Therefore, I strongly disagree that having a single world currency would be of unquestioned benefit, and more careful consideration of the potential consequences is needed before pursuing such a policy.
1295;With the vast increase in online resources today, libraries with print books are not a necessity for today’s society.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is indeed true that digital resources today far outstrip what can be put and stored in print books. Almost any kind of book can now be accessed digitally and those that can’t be will soon be changed to a digital format. Some people, therefore, believe that libraries with print books are no longer needed.If one looks at this issue dispassionately, it seems far more logical that people now should only read books digitally. It only requires a single computer or electronic reader and an individual can have access to the history of literature and works on all other fields. The costs involved with setting, typing, printing and distributing print books would practically disappear and this would make things more convenient and much cheaper. An actual library building would be totally unnecessary, as all one would need would be a ‘virtual library’ as a website and all works could be accessed through this portal. There would not even be any need to leave the house to gain access to anything one needed. This would seem to be the most logical way of proceeding.Logic, however, is not always the best approach to everything. Print books have a long history with humanity and our relationship with real books is not something that can be changed overnight. Many people, including younger readers, feel that there is something special about having a book with real paper and needing to turn pages. There will therefore for the time being be a future for print books and libraries.Libraries will continue to be especially important, as not all older people use computers and e-readers as much as the younger generation. They will still want to read print books and the library is a cheap and convenient place to find them. In addition, if only a few books in print are available in the future, libraries might be one of the few places where they might be accessed. Another purpose that libraries serve is acting as community centres that organise events, education and childcare. Ironically, libraries also provide computers and Internet access for people who cannot afford their own.In spite of the seeming dominance to come of digital books, I feel that there is and will be a place for libraries with print books. This state of affairs might change in the future, but at present, they are important community resources.;"The statement that libraries with print books are not a necessity for today's society has sparked a heated debate. While it is true that digital resources today far outstrip what can be put and stored in print books, I only partially agree with this statement. On one hand, it is undeniable that almost any kind of book can now be accessed digitally, and those that can't will soon be changed to a digital format. This ease of access and convenience has led some people to believe that libraries with print books are no longer needed. With the rise of e-books, online journals, and digital archives, it seems that physical libraries may become a relic of the past.However, I disagree with the idea that libraries with print books are completely unnecessary. Despite the advancement of digital technology, print books still hold a unique value. For instance, many people still prefer to read physical books, citing the tactile experience and the ability to disconnect from screens. Moreover, libraries offer more than just access to books; they provide a quiet and peaceful space for studying, research, and community activities. Many libraries have also adapted to the digital age by incorporating digital resources and services, making them a hub for both physical and digital learning.Furthermore, not all communities have equal access to digital resources, and libraries with print books serve as a vital resource for those who may not have access to digital technology. Therefore, while digital resources have undoubtedly changed the way we access information, I believe that libraries with print books still have a significant role to play in today's society. They provide a unique experience, a sense of community, and a vital resource for those who need it, making them still a necessity in our increasingly digital world."
1392;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Capital punishment is always associated with ignorance and intolerance. In fact, we must acknowledge that some people disagree with this kind of penalty, but others vote in its favor. Portugal was the first European country to end this kind of penalty. Since the 19th century, tolerance and respect for life important values. Moreover, we can affirm that remains under the same codes. Maybe because of a religious view point, the respect for life is a typical value in the Old Catholic world.Those who are in favor of capital punishment mostly live in developing countries. However, this is not just an image of the Third World countries. Actually, the USA is one country where this kind of punishment has its rates of application. The state of Texas, in particular, is at the top, supporting this measure against crime, especially those involving serial killers and crimes against children. In a society dominated by fear and government control, it is foreseen that this penalty will continue .Maybe this is not a simple question. As we can see there are several values here and of course cultural behavior. The roots of the question are religious, cultural, ethical and even geographical. The world is divided and the law systems show this division. The solutions, however can lead us to other questions concerning revenge and justice. better to kill a person because of his crimes? Can we admit that a life sentence could be a much better sentence? In fact, rehabilitation is the right way especially with an accurate psychological evaluation first. Some people are lost forever, and in my opinion some murderers and other criminals will suffer more in jail. In this sense, capital punishment is an easy way out.;The notion that capital punishment is essential to control violence in society is a debatable topic. While some argue that it deters crime and makes our lives more secure, the counterargument is that it is a regressive and inhumane practice. In my opinion, I disagree with the statement that our lives are less secure without capital punishment and that it is necessary to control violence.Capital punishment is always associated with ignorance and intolerance, as it reflects a society's willingness to take a life in the name of justice. This practice is often championed by those who lack empathy and understanding of the complexities of human behavior. Interestingly, those who are in favor of capital punishment mostly live in developing countries, where access to education, economic opportunities, and social services are limited. This correlation suggests that the support for capital punishment is often rooted in a lack of exposure to more enlightened and humane approaches to justice.The United States, particularly the state of Texas, is a notable example of a region that strongly supports capital punishment as a measure against crime. Texas has the highest number of executions in the country, which raises questions about the effectiveness and morality of this practice. Rather than serving as a deterrent, capital punishment may actually perpetuate a cycle of violence and retribution, undermining efforts to build a more just and compassionate society.In conclusion, the relationship between capital punishment and crime rates is complex, and there is no conclusive evidence to support the claim that capital punishment is essential to control violence. Instead, it is a practice that reflects societal ignorance and intolerance, and its continued use undermines human dignity and the pursuit of more humane and effective approaches to justice.

Laws should be implemented and executed in the most proper way that not allow the offender to commit violent acts or to break the law in any way and to any extent. To sum up, it is the responsibility of the state to stop people involved in crime. It may be done through solving the problems of the people that led them to commit that act or by the punishment accordingly.Where are the paragraphs? This is a good essay; however there are many small mistakes that might cost you dearly. There are also several unclear expressions and grammatical errors.";The statement that without capital punishment our lives are less secure and crimes or violence increase is a topic of debate. I partially agree with this opinion. In my view, a person who is involved in a crime and shows no intention of stopping their law-breaking acts should be punished in an extremely serious way. Capital punishment can be an effective deterrent for such individuals, who pose a significant threat to society. For instance, certain heinous crimes, such as murder or terrorism, may warrant capital punishment as a means of upholding justice and maintaining social order.However, not all crimes are equal, and some may require a smaller penalty. For example, a minor offense, such as theft or vandalism, may not necessitate capital punishment. In such cases, alternative forms of punishment, such as imprisonment or community service, may be more appropriate. The key is to ensure that the punishment fits the crime and serves as a deterrent, while also providing an opportunity for rehabilitation.Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the government to provide a secure and better state to live in. The government should be the authority that decides which crimes warrant capital punishment and which do not. By doing so, the government can ensure that justice is served, while also protecting the rights and safety of its citizens. In conclusion, while I agree that capital punishment can be necessary in certain cases, I also believe that it should be used judiciously and in conjunction with other forms of punishment to create a fair and just society. The government must strike a balance between punishment and rehabilitation to create a secure and better state to live in.
163;Write about the following topic.Although there are a lot of translation software available, learning a language could still be advantageous. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people claim that language knowledge has still benefited inspite of appearance of applications and websites providing translation in real time. Modern special software is able to give quite quality translation into different languages, and it seems that it will soon replace the translators and will get rid of necessity to learn new languages. However, in my opinion, there are still some essential advantages to know foreign languages.First of all, any language is so complicated and constantly changing system that it is impossible to automized translation process to keep all senses. For instance, if you interlocutor creates a joke based on words game, it will unlikely recognise by AI. Thus, it is too hard to teach a computer to uderstand all meanings that you want to provide.Another important aspect of learning languages is knowing new cultures. Language is the great source for understanding other nations and countries. If you use online translator, you will never know the origine of some idioms or phrases that contain culture code.Moreover, learning new language is a tool of training your brain. It helps to develop memory and imagination. For instance, people didn't refuse studying maths after calculation device had been invented, because it is still important to understand how it works and it is necessary for developing other sciences.Finally, there is a lot of places and occasions when you do not have internet access. Then online translators are not available. But if you need help or ask a path being abroad, it is better to know at least some phrases. Otherwise, you can occur in unpleasant situation.To sum up, I definitely agree the statement that learning languages is essential in spite of techology progress. Although artificial intelligence is able to translate everything you want, it is crucial to continue learning languages in order to understand all sense and meanings in conversation with foreigners, to know new cultures and understand their peculiarities and, of course, to make your brain work.;"The advent of translation software has led some to believe that learning a language is no longer necessary. However, I strongly agree that knowing a foreign language still has numerous advantages. Despite the emergence of applications and websites that provide real-time translations, language knowledge has continued to benefit individuals in various ways.First and foremost, languages are complex and constantly evolving systems, making it challenging to automate the translation process. Idioms,ioms, colloquialisms, and nuances of language cannot be fully captured by translation software, which can lead to misinterpretations and misunderstandings. For instance, the English phrase ""break a leg"" cannot be literally translated, as its meaning is opposite of what the words suggest. In such cases, having knowledge of the language enables individuals to comprehend the intended meaning, rather than relying on potentially inaccurate translations.Another significant aspect of learning languages is the opportunity to discover new cultures. Language is intricately linked with culture, and understanding the language provides a window into the customs, values, and beliefs of a society. By learning a foreign language, individuals can gain a deeper appreciation for the associated culture, fostering greater empathy, tolerance, and global understanding. For example, learning Spanish not only allows individuals to communicate with native speakers but also provides insight into the rich cultural heritage of Spain and Latin America, including its literature, art, and history.In conclusion, while translation software has certainly made communication across languages more accessible, it is still essential to learn foreign languages. The complexities of language and the cultural insights that come with learning a new language make it an invaluable skill, one that cannot be fully replaced by technology. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the ability to communicate across languages and cultures will only continue to grow in importance, making language knowledge a valuable asset in both personal and professional contexts."

Why are more people choosing to have operation to change the way they look? Do you think this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;A greater number of individuals opted for plastic surgery to enhance the physical outlook. What could be the reason behind the increasing number of people opting for cosmetic surgery to deter their appearance.In my opinion the main reason why cosmetic surgery is in demand nowadays is because society has set a certain standard that physical appearance will be the fastest ticket to stand out in the crowd. Second is it boosts confidence to people with low self esteem.The favorable outcome is not as much the adverse effect to the individuals. Example, the fastest way to reduce wrinkles on the face is to get Botox treatment. It lasts 3-4 months, after that it needs continuous medication to maintain what has been changed. It takes a lot of money to satisfy the demands of the society. On top of that repetition of pain and recovery during and after the surgery.There are numerous natural ways to enhance beauty and confidence. Contentment, exercise and a healthy lifestyle are effective methods to maintain the genuine beauty of the people. Simple walking in the morning, keeping the distance from negativity and eating vegetables and fruits are the simplest methods that boost the natural glow of the body and prevent us from being sick.To conclude the essay, I think plastic surgery is not necessary to enhance physical outlook as it uses synthetic components that have harmful effects within the body.;The demand for cosmetic surgery has skyrocketed in recent years, with an increasing number of people opting to go under the knife to enhance their physical appearance. This trend can be attributed to the societal pressure to conform to a certain standard of beauty, where physical appearance is often perceived as the key to standing out in the crowd. As a result, people feel compelled to undergo plastic surgery to improve their self-esteem and gain a competitive edge in their personal and professional lives.However, I believe that this development is more negative than positive. While cosmetic surgery may yield favorable outcomes for some, the adverse effects on individuals far outweigh the benefits. The risks associated with surgery, such as scarring, complications, and emotional trauma, can have long-lasting and devastating consequences. Furthermore, the emphasis on physical appearance can perpetuate unrealistic beauty standards and low self-esteem, particularly among young people.Rather than resorting to surgery, there are numerous natural ways to enhance beauty and confidence. A healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and adequate sleep, can work wonders for one's physical and mental well-being. Additionally, practicing self-care, such as meditation and mindfulness, can help individuals develop a positive self-image and boost their confidence. These natural methods not only promote overall wellness but also foster a more positive and inclusive definition of beauty, one that values individuality and uniqueness over unrealistic and unattainable standards. In conclusion, while cosmetic surgery may seem like a quick fix, its risks and negative consequences far outweigh its benefits, and individuals should explore natural and holistic approaches to enhancing their beauty and confidence.

What solutions can you suggest?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Most children are facing one form of bullying or the other in our schools on daily basis world wide. It is becoming a serious problem and there is a need to solve this. In this essay, we would be considering two causes and possible ways to solve these.First of all, the rate at which children bullying each other in the school environment is rising. One major cause is that bullying breeds bullying, children who are faced with physical, mental and emotional abuse from homes tend to transfer their fustrations on their peers. They think that is how one is supposed to live, exacting authority to gain superiority on weaker peers in school. Another is children who has low self esteem, such students feels threatened over their classmates they taught to be more intelligent or having better physical appearance than them.Although, there are several causes of bullying, teachers should be taught how to identify children who are from abusive homes and inform the appropriate authority. These students would taken away from such toxic environment early and they would be sent for some pschological therapy. Meanwhile, education is also a key factor especially for children who have low self esteem. This should be done by forms such as role plays, presentation and drama, where these students are taught how to have self love and accepting what they can not change on their self.In conclusion, children from abusive homes and those who have low self esteem are some of the reasons for bullying. I recommend that early identification of abusive children and education is some of the ways we can solve these problems.;"Bullying is a pervasive and disturbing issue that plagues many schools worldwide. It is alarming to note that most children are facing one form of bullying or the other on a daily basis. This is becoming a serious problem that requires immediate attention and solution. In this essay, we will delve into two significant causes of bullying and explore possible ways to address them.Firstly, one of the primary causes of bullying is the lack of empathy and understanding among students. Many children are not taught to appreciate and respect individual differences, leading to the targeting of vulnerable students who may be perceived as ""different"". For instance, a child who wears glasses or has a disability may be ridiculed and ostracized by their peers. Another cause of bullying is the desire for power and control. Some students may engage in bullying behavior as a means to assert their dominance and establish a hierarchy within the school.To combat bullying, schools can implement programs that promote empathy and inclusivity. For example, introducing diversity and sensitivity training can help students understand and appreciate the experiences of their peers. Additionally, schools can establish clear consequences for bullying behavior, while also providing support and protection for victims. This can include counseling services, peer mentoring, and anonymous reporting systems. By addressing the root causes of bullying and providing a safe and supportive environment, we can work towards creating a bully-free school culture. It is imperative that we take collective action to solve this problem, as the well-being and education of our children depend on it. By doing so, we can ensure that every child feels safe, valued, and supported in their educational journey."

With just a few clicks, people can buy books, air tickets, groceries, and many other items from the comfort of their own homes. This trend is becoming increasingly popular, and for good reason. Many individuals shop online to have fun and enjoy the convenience it offers, while others do so due to lack of time to visit department stores. In my opinion, the advantages of online shopping outweigh the disadvantages, although there are some notable drawbacks.On the one hand, online shopping provides unparalleled convenience, allowing people to browse and purchase items at any time and from any location. This is particularly beneficial for those with busy schedules or living in remote areas with limited access to physical stores. Additionally, online shopping often offers a wider selection of products, competitive prices, and the ability to read reviews from other customers, making informed purchasing decisions easier.On the other hand, online shopping also has its disadvantages. One of the most significant downsides is the risk of order delays, which can be frustrating, especially when the item is needed urgently. Sometimes, orders may arrive at the wrong time, such as when the recipient is not at home, leading to further inconvenience. Moreover, the lack of physical interaction with products before purchase can lead to issues with sizing, quality, or color, which may not be entirely accurate as depicted online.Despite these disadvantages, the benefits of online shopping, such as convenience, flexibility, and access to a global market, make it an attractive option for many. To mitigate the disadvantages, online retailers are continually improving their services, offering more precise delivery timing estimates, and easier return or exchange policies. In conclusion, while online shopping comes with its set of challenges, the advantages it offers make it a preferred method of shopping for a growing number of people, including myself.
515;Write about the following topic.Cohabitation is believed to bring huge advantages for young people since it enables them to fully understand each other before deciding to get married.Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many people believe it may be advisable for couples to live together before getting married, as it may lead to a smoother relationship after they have married.I tend to agree with such opinions, as I find the arguments that usually support them to be quite reasonable. For example, it is commonly said that people act differently when they are at home and when they are outside. People instinctively tend to be more relaxed and off-guard when at home, whereas in social situations they usually make an effort, even if unconsciously, to be more likable and to conceal the less agreeable aspects of their personality from others, even their partners. Because of this, it is usual to hear that one does not truly know someone until one has lived with that person.In extreme cases, cohabitation before marriage could even prevent couples from entering into a marriage that is bound to fail and will lead to unhappiness. Considering this possibility seems reasonable, as marriage is not only an emotional bond, but also a legal one, and undoing it is usually upsetting, time-consuming and costly.Another reason I find cohabitation before marriage to be a sensible choice is that, as minor disagreements and conflicts are usually inevitable during the first months of cohabitation, it is preferable to pass through that stage before getting married than to add such problems to a period which in itself can already be stressful, such as the few weeks before the ceremony and the weeks following.What I have said up to this point reflects my opinion, but it must be noted I did not put any of it into practice when I got married. Indeed, my wife and I decided to move in together only a few weeks before the ceremony. This decision was due to the fact that her family is quite old-fashioned, and moving in together before would undoubtedly have caused them pain, even if we had our reasons for doing so and they would have understood them. No degree of persuasion would have avoided or removed such pain. We found the long-term benefits of a stable and close relationship with her family to be more important than the discomfort of not moving in together, and we ultimately decided to do it only once the ceremony was planned.;The idea that cohabitation brings significant advantages for young people before marriage is a topic of ongoing debate. In my opinion, I strongly agree with this viewpoint. Cohabitation before marriage enables couples to fully understand each other, which can be crucial in determining the success of their relationship.One of the primary advantages of cohabitation is that it allows couples to experience the realities of living together, which can be vastly different from the romanticized notion of marriage. During this period, minor disagreements and conflicts are usually inevitable, especially during the first months of cohabitation. However, these disagreements can serve as a test of the relationship's strength and resilience. By navigating through these challenges before getting married, couples can assess their compatibility and make informed decisions about their future together.Moreover, cohabitation before marriage could even prevent couples from entering into a marriage that is bound to fail. By living together, couples can identify potential issues and incompatibilities that may not have been apparent during the dating phase. This can save them from the emotional and financial stress of a divorce. It is preferable to pass through the stage of minor disagreements and conflicts before getting married than to add such problems to a period which in itself can be stressful, such as the initial years of marriage. In conclusion, cohabitation before marriage is a sensible step that allows young people to gauge their relationship's potential for success,Overall, cohabitation provides a unique opportunity for couples to evaluate their relationship, iron out differences, and develop a deeper understanding of each other. By doing so, they can build a stronger foundation for their future together, which can ultimately lead to a more successful and fulfilling marriage.

What measures can be taken to protect them?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;These days, consumers often suffer from the increase of numbers of advertisements conducted by competing companies. I believe that this fact has certain negative effects on consumers' working performance as well as their private space and time. In order to protect consumers, some proposals related to protecting their information and eliminating the number of advertisements are required.The increasing number of advertisements has a negative effect on the consumers. Firstly, their working perfomance can be reduced. Obivously, when a person is working, he cannot receive a large number of advertisements, process and response them. I know a researcher who receives a lot of advertising emails from certain banksand even some scientific journal while he require time to perform many research projects. This makes him feel uncomfortable when working, thereby reducing the research's quality. Secondly, the advertisements can affect on people private space and time. For examle, when they spend time on their family after a hard working day, or even when they are sleeping. This completyly affects on the consumers, in terms of both physical and mental health.For protecting consumers, certain methods need to be proposed. Firstly, it can be implied that the consumers' information is illegal used by many companies. Therefore, an imporvement of security method can allow us to protect consumers. Secondly, eliminating the number of advertisements performed by companies and eliminating the hours for companies send advertisements are required.In conclusion, the increasing numbers of advertisements leads to certain unwanted results for consumers, such as reducing their working performance as well as their private space and time. For protecting consumers, we need to protect their personal information and eliminate the number of advertisements.;"In today's world, consumers are constantly bombarded with a plethora of advertisements from competing companies, making it increasingly difficult for them to make informed decisions. These days, consumers often suffer from the increase of numbers of advertisements conducted by competing companies, which can lead to confusion, misinformation, and ultimately, poor purchasing decisions. The influence of advertisements on consumers cannot be overstated, as they play a significant role in shaping their preferences, attitudes, and behaviors.The extent to which consumers are influenced by advertisements is substantial, with many being swayed by catchy slogans, enticing visuals, and persuasive messaging. For instance, a consumer may be convinced to purchase a particular brand of clothing or electronics based on an advertisement's claim of superior quality or unique features, even if such claims are exaggerated or false. Furthermore, the sheer volume of advertisements can lead to a phenomenon known as ""advertising fatigue,"" where consumers become desensitized to the messages being conveyed, making it even more challenging for companies to effectively communicate with their target audience.In order to protect consumers, some proposals related to protecting their information and eliminating the number of advertisements are required. For protecting consumers, certain methods need to be proposed, such as implementing stricter regulations on advertising practices, promoting media literacy, and encouraging transparent labeling. Additionally, companies can adopt self-regulatory measures, such as adhering to truth-in-advertising standards and respecting consumers' privacy. By taking these measures, consumers can be better equipped to navigate the complex landscape of advertisements and make more informed decisions. Ultimately, it is essential to strike a balance between the need for companies to advertise their products and the need to protect consumers from the potential negative effects of advertising."

Some people think that the closure of local business will bring about the death of local communities.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;As the huge company extends their bussiness, the local markets is dimmished to local society. This essay explains why I disagree closure of local business will bring about the death of local communities with relevant examples.First, Big company drag the new residents. I believe major company make the local communities to flourish. My cusion lived in countryside for 30 years. Every time when I visited that place, that farm land still same during the a few decades. However, recently when I dropped by there I surprised with new tall building that newly built. My cusion told me once the big supermarkert open in this neighborhood, grasp many couples or familly to live here. Eventually, that rural place's population is surged.Someone thought giant grocery's product cheap price can not compete with local product, that make local place to close. I considered it is anachromism idea. Now the customer's purchasing value is totally diffrent with previous eras. Buyer start choose organic product and eco-friendlly or morality brand. If local stores have their own unique products, which are not replace with other, such as handmade cheese and unique taste of bread, local bussiness can compete with global chain markets.In conclusion, albeit famous company expands their sites every moments, the local community can be larger by new residents settled down near local region. Also, local bussiness have specialty, community can not dismissed;The rapid expansion of supermarkets in some countries has led to the decline of small, local businesses, which has sparked concerns about the potential demise of local communities. However, I disagree with the notion that the closure of local businesses will bring about the death of local communities. While it is true that the huge companies extending their business can diminish the local markets to local society, the impact is not entirely negative.In fact, local communities can still thrive despite the presence of supermarkets. For instance, many local businesses are adapting to the changing market conditions by offering unique products and services that cannot be found in supermarkets. Moreover, local communities are not solely defined by their businesses, but also by their cultural events, traditions, and social connections. The closure of local businesses may even create opportunities for new, innovative enterprises to emerge, which can revitalize the community.Furthermore, the loss of local businesses can also lead to a renewed sense of community spirit, as residents come together to support each other and find new ways to sustain their local economy. For example, in some towns, community-led initiatives have been established to promote local trade and support small businesses, which has helped to maintain the community's identity and cohesion. Therefore, while the expansion of supermarkets may pose challenges to local businesses, it is not a death sentence for local communities. Instead, it can be an opportunity for innovation, adaptation, and community-led revitalization.

Anyway, a lot of people think that this types of sports are very dangerous and should be banned. This essay will talk about extreme sports giving my own opinion about the idea of banning this activities because of their risks.Practicing a sport is very important for the general health of a person; a lot of people choose to practice dangerous sports, like skiing, because of the adrenaline and the sensation that it brings to you. Sports of this type can help you to go over your fear and they will help you to see life from a different perspective.Anyway, the risks that an athlete will go through are many; every year the amount of people that have injuries or, sometimes die, because of this types of activities are numerous.

Practicing sports is important but it is also fundamental to try your best to avoid injuries when practicing it. This essay talked about extreme sports and their risk, giving my own opinion at the end.";The notion that extreme sports, as sky diving and skiing, are perilous and should be prohibited has garnered significant attention in recent years. A lot of people think that these activities are very dangerous and should be banned due to the high risk of injury or even death associated with them. This essay will delve into the realm of extreme sports, presenting my perspective on the idea of banning these activities because of their risks.In my opinion, I partially disagree with the idea of banning extreme sports. While it is undeniable that these activities carry inherent risks, it is also important to acknowledge the numerous benefits they provide to participants. Extreme sports can foster a sense of adventure, build confidence, and enhance physical and mental well-being. For instance, sky diving and skiing require a high level of physical fitness, mental focus, and discipline, which can have a positive impact on an individual's overall health and lifestyle.Moreover, banning extreme sports would also have a detrimental impact on the economy and tourism. Many countries and regions rely heavily on extreme sports to attract tourists and generate revenue.

Furthermore, with proper training, equipment, and safety measures in place, the risks associated with extreme sports can be minimized.In conclusion, while extreme sports do pose risks, I believe that banning them is not the solution. Instead, emphasis should be placed on ensuring that participants are properly trained, equipped, and aware of the risks involved. By doing so, individuals can continue to enjoy the thrill and benefits of extreme sports while minimizing the dangers associated with them. Ultimately, it is crucial to strike a balance between safety and the freedom to pursue adventurous activities.

Personally, I think there are some good advantages team activities cause our life,and especially in business scenes more comfortable and productive.Initially, only one person's work is limited, compared with group activities. This means that working only one person will be able to cause some profits to some extent. On the other hand, group working will be more productive and efficient to make more sales figures. In addition, each person has a great ability. For example, some people have great communication skills and negotiations. Those people arethe most appropriate roles for sales. Furthermore, some people are good at analysing the group performance quality and making strategies. Those who are good at these activities are best for marketing team. As a result, they can focus on their strong points for work and they can divide and conquer the tasks with each other.Of course, some people are eager to work alone at their own relaxed pace and make a profit to some extent. This is less stressful they do not need to keep attention from other colleagues. But this means that they need to decide all tasks and take all responsibility. Sometimes it might be risky once they made a mistake and caused a huge deficit.Finally, there is no doubt that more than two heads are better than one. People can share their experiences and opinion to improve their group activities. If some people who are sensitive and feel pressure if some people meddle in too much. It is necessary to organize some rules that must be effective. For example, all people need to try to stay positive, avoid stating negative or swear words, and not deny one person's opinion straightforwardly and emotionally. Making a great atmosphere, saying positive words with each other, and including some humor, will lead to everyone's performance being more productive.;The notion that group or team activities can teach more important skills for life than those activities which are done alone is widely discussed across the globe. Personally, I think there are some good advantages team activities cause our life, and especially in business scenes, to be more comfortable and productive. Group work can be more beneficial for people's lives as it fosters essential skills such as communication, problem-solving, and time management.Team activities provide individuals with the opportunity to collaborate, share ideas, and learn from one another's strengths and weaknesses. For instance, in a business setting, group projects often require employees to work together towards a common goal, promoting teamwork, adaptability, and leadership. These skills are invaluable in the professional world, where effective collaboration and communication are crucial for success. Moreover, group work helps to build trust, resolve conflicts, and develop empathy among team members, all of which are vital for personal and professional growth.In contrast, solo activities, while beneficial for developing individual skills, can lack the dynamism and diversity that group work offers. Solo activities can also lead to a narrow perspective, whereas group work encourages the sharing of different viewpoints and ideas, leading to more innovative and well-rounded solutions. For example, in academic settings, group assignments often yield better results than individual ones, as they encourage students to engage in discussions, debates, and peer-to-peer learning, thereby enhancing their critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.In conclusion, I strongly agree that group or team activities can teach more important skills for life than solo activities. The benefits of teamwork, including improved communication, problem-solving, and time management, make it an indispensable aspect of personal and professional development. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the ability to work effectively in teams will become a vital skill, making group activities an essential component of our learning and growth.
317;Write about the following topic.In many countries large amounts of foods are wasted. Why do you think people waste food in this way? What can be done to reduce the amount of food thrown away?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, many countries are confronted with the increasing amount of waste and one of the major contributions is food wasted by people. This issue is mainly driven by an over-ordered food and misunderstanding about the method of food disposal. However, people could cease from creating food waste through the act of both restaurants and governments.To begin with, it is obvious that countries have wasted because the amount of food that people buy is more than the amount they need. The crucial factor of this behavior is that when people contemplate menus in a restaurant, they tend to order many items in order to satisfy their desire level. Eventually, a lot of food scraps are left when these people finish eating their meals. Another potential cause could be because people do not know how to deal with food scraps. As a result, they might understand that putting wasted food into a garbage is the only solution they could do. This is exemplified by statistics published by Thai waste association which demonstrate that more than a half of waste in Thailand come from household food.A possible solution for this matter could be for restaurants to fine their customers who leave some food. This policy possibly encourages customers to carefully think of the reasonable amount of food when they order. In addition, from the country’s level governments could also educate their citizens including companies in the food-service industry about how to do with food waste due to the fact that some edible items could be food for animals. For instance, authorities could give an instruction demonstrating that dogs can be fed with remaining food such as rice or bread while remaining vegetables can be food for rabbits.In conclusion, people waste food since they order food by what they want without considering the amount and most of them misunderstand about the way to dispose of food waste. Nevertheless, this concern can be coped with the penalty by restaurants as well as the guidance from governments regarding feeding animal with food scraps.;The issue of food waste has become a significant concern in many countries, with a substantial amount of edible food being discarded. One of the primary reasons for this phenomenon is the tendency of people to over-order food, often leading to a surplus that ultimately ends up in landfills. Furthermore, the misconception about the proper method of food disposal also contributes to this problem. For instance, many individuals are unaware of the importance of composting or recycling food waste, resulting in a substantial amount of waste that could be otherwise reused.To mitigate this issue, a possible solution could be implemented by restaurants, where customers who leave a significant amount of food on their plates are fined. This approach would not only encourage people to be more mindful of their food intake but also promote a culture of sustainability. Moreover, governments could play a vital role in educating their citizens about the proper disposal of food waste. By launching public awareness campaigns and providing guidelines on composting and recycling, governments can empower individuals to make informed decisions about their food consumption and disposal habits.For example, in some countries, governments have initiated programs to collect food waste and convert it into biogas or fertilizer, reducing the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. By adopting such measures, we can significantly reduce the amount of food thrown away and promote a more sustainable food culture. Ultimately, it is essential for individuals, restaurants, and governments to work together to address the issue of food waste and create a more environmentally conscious society. By taking these steps, we can minimize the amount of food waste and contribute to a more sustainable future.
1025;Write about the following topic.In many countries, a small number of people earn extremely high salaries. Some people believe that this is good for the country, but others think that governments should not allow salaries above a certain level.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In many parts of the world, few people get a lot of money thanks to their job. It is believed by some that this is an advantage for the country, while it is thought by others that governments should put a limit above which salaries cannot be.In my opinion, I believe that not only people have to be rewarded for their performance, but also their wage salary has to be proportional to the benefits that they are leading to the country.For instance, due to the Covid a lot of people suffered several injuries which were cured only thanks to the doctors and the nurses. For this reason, since they are saving lifes everyday,it seems unbelievable the fact that they are earning much less money than football players.Another example can be found in people involved in the national security: I believe that it would be fairer if these professionals were paid more than an influencer.However, in our society this figures (such as doctors) are paid by governments through taxes, while football players or influncers gain incomes by private companies.In order to not impose an heavier taxation, politics should categorise jobs basing on their importance in the society. Hence, we will have a specific amount that these employers can earn.Thus, if these no-fundamental workers (like actors or actress) are earning more money than the precise level chosen, these will be used as funds to increase life-saving jobs' salary.In conclusion, I believe that highest salaries should exist only if we are referring to a job that is needed by everyone.;In many parts of the world, few people get a lot of money thanks to their job, sparking a debate about whether extremely high salaries are beneficial to a country. On one hand, some argue that high salaries are necessary to attract and retain top talent, driving innovation and economic growth. They believe that exceptional individuals should be rewarded for their exceptional performance, as it benefits the country as a whole. On the other hand, others think that governments should implement a salary cap to prevent excessive income inequality and promote fairness.In my opinion, not only do people have to be rewarded for their performance, but also their wage salary has to be proportional to the benefits that they are leading to the country. For instance, medical professionals, scientists, and engineers make significant contributions to society, improving healthcare, technology, and infrastructure. I believe that it would be fairer if these professionals were paid more than, for example, an influencer, whose impact on the country's development is relatively minimal. It is essential to recognize and compensate individuals who create tangible value and benefits for the community, rather than just those who have a large following or fame.Moreover, excessive salaries can lead to a widening wealth gap, which can have negative social and economic consequences. By setting a reasonable salary range, governments can ensure that wealth is distributed more evenly, promoting social cohesion and stability. In conclusion, while high salaries can be motivating and beneficial, it is crucial to strike a balance between rewarding exceptional performance and promoting fairness and equality. By doing so, we can create a more just and equitable society, where individuals are compensated according to the value they create for the country.

Do you think it is a positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"At present, discovering one`s own family history is becoming more and more commom. In the following paragraphs, I will present the motives why people do that and the reason I strongly believe this is important and have positive effects on people.Probably the most crucial motive people search for their family`s past is to find out about any chronical diseases. One of society`s biggest concern nowadays is healthy leaving. Therefore, by knowing the family health history and genetic predisposition to a specific disease such as cancer or diabetes, one can prepare and take the appropriate mesures to prevent it or have an early treatment.Moreover, another reason people may seek for their ancestors`s history is to build a sense of belonging. Human beings need to feel welcomed and inserted into a culture; a community`s identity is as important as an individual one, as it provides people with the opportunity to grow and develop relantioships. When people know about their family history, their sense of belonging is promoted, and they can actively participate in their culture and contribute to their community.As mentioned in the previous paragraphs, people search about family history for health and cultural reasons. One and the other do impact positivily a person`s life, as being healthy and part of a community integrate people`s satisfaction about living.To summarize, one may try to find out about their family history for two main motives, one being about their health and the other one about feeling part of a community. Both reasons are important and have positive impacts on one`s life.";In recent years, discovering one's own family history has become an increasingly popular pursuit in various parts of the world. People are now more than ever interested in tracing back their roots and uncovering the secrets of their ancestors' past. But what drives individuals to embark on this journey of self-discovery? In my opinion, searching for one's family history is a positive trend, and there are several compelling reasons that support this viewpoint.One of the most crucial motives people search for their family's past is to find out about any chronic diseases that may have affected their ancestors. By doing so, they can gain valuable insights into their own health risks and take preventive measures to mitigate potential threats. For instance, a person who discovers that their grandparents suffered from heart disease may be more inclined to maintain a healthy lifestyle and undergo regular check-ups to reduce their own risk of developing the condition.Another reason people seek out their ancestors' history is to build a sense of belonging. By learning about their heritage and cultural roots, they can develop a deeper understanding of their identity and connect with their community on a more profound level. This sense of belonging can foster a stronger sense of self and provide individuals with a unique perspective on life. Furthermore, it allows people to appreciate the sacrifices and achievements of their forebears, which can be a powerful motivator and source of inspiration.In conclusion, uncovering one's family history is a worthwhile endeavor that offers numerous benefits, including health awareness and a sense of belonging. As this trend continues to grow, it is likely that more people will embark on this fascinating journey of discovery, leading to a greater appreciation for their heritage and a stronger connection to their roots.
987;Write about the following topic.Information technology is changing many aspects of our lives and now dominates our home, leisure and work activities.To what extent do the benefits of information technology outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;There is no doubt that these days information technology has invaded our space and dominated our home leisure and work. However, the question: is dominating our lives by this technology have a negative or positive impact on our lives? Is considered one of the most controversial issues today. In this essay, I am going to examine this phenomenon from both viewpoints.On one side of the argument, some people argue that the benefits considerably outweigh the disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is integrating technology in every aspect eases our lives and decreases hardworking. For example, advanced houses with integrated voice commands give the person the ability to achieve multiple tasks without any physical activity. Moreover, the technology allows people to connect multiple devices with an email address and control them remotely. One good illustration of that you can switch on and off your home AC while you are at work by the WIFI technology.On the other hand, it is also possible to consider it with the opposing case. It is often argued that in fact using advanced technology increase the number of unhealthy people. People often have this opinion because people become lazier, and their daily activity dramatically decreases making them prone to diseases.As we have seen, there are no easy answers to this question. On balance, however, I tend to believe that using advanced information technology should be limited to simple tasks, so at any point if a technical error happened you can resume your life without any obstacles.;The advent of information technology has undoubtedly transformed many facets of our lives, including our home, leisure, and work activities. The question of whether this dominance has a negative or positive impact on our lives is considered one of the most controversial issues today. Some people argue that the benefits of information technology considerably outweigh the disadvantages, while others claim the opposite. In my opinion, the advantages of information technology far surpass its drawbacks.Information technology has invaded our space and dominated our home, leisure, and work activities, to the point where it is now an indispensable part of our daily routines. On the one hand, the benefits of information technology are multifaceted. For instance, it has enabled rapid global communication, eased access to vast amounts of information, and enhanced productivity in the workplace. Additionally, it has opened up new avenues for entertainment, education, and social interaction. With the click of a button, we can now connect with people worldwide, access a plethora of educational resources, and enjoy a wide range of entertainment options from the comfort of our homes.On the other hand, some argue that this technology has several disadvantages, such as decreased face-to-face interaction, increased dependency on digital devices, and potential privacy and security risks. However, I believe that these drawbacks can be mitigated with responsible use and proper safeguards. For example, setting boundaries on screen time and being cautious with online personal data can minimize the negative impacts. Overall, the benefits of information technology, including enhanced connectivity, convenience, and knowledge, outweigh its disadvantages, making it a profoundly positive force in our lives. As technology continues to evolve, it is crucial that we harness its power while being mindful of its potential pitfalls, ensuring that its dominance in our lives remains a blessing rather than a curse.

Technology and traditional cultures are incompatible.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many people hold the view that traditional culture and technological development cannot coexist as the latter catch on, the former will be bound to disappear. I totally disagree with this because both can be implemented jointly by putting technology at the service of tradition and through pilot projects.To begin with, technological progress, which is making major strides in our daily lives, is the means by which local mores, custom and traditions could be brought back to life, proving they are compatible. In fact, by tapping technology to make tradition far more attractive, considerably more audience will be engaged into such activities. Bologna is a case in point, since, thanks to digital machines and drones which have supported housewives into the making of , the traditional celebration of “making pasta day ” has recently being turned into a successful events, which draws people from country as far afield as China.Another example of possible coexistence is the possibility to heighten awareness of people costumes through the creation of pilot projects which bring both habits and technology to a new whole level. This can be put into practice by setting a direct connection to cultural heritage of a specific area of the world to those who do not have access easily. To this end, many primary schools in New York have developed a project in which, owing to the ultimate high speed connection, pupils who come from abroad can learn ancient craft directly from a master located in their country of origin.To conclude, I firmly believe that traditional culture and technology development are widely compatible as the technology can positively beef up the presence of cultural traditions nowadays, so as to keep its memory Alive. In addition, pioneering projects can be implemented to underpin cultural awareness amongst youngsters.;The notion that traditional cultures will inevitably be lost as technology advances is a widely held belief. Many people hold the view that traditional culture and technological development cannot coexist, as the latter catches on, the former will be bound to disappear. However, I totally disagree with this perspective. In my opinion, traditional cultures and technological development are not mutually exclusive, and it is possible for them to coexist and even complement each other.By putting technology at the service of tradition, it is possible to preserve and promote traditional cultures. For instance, technology can be used to document and digitize traditional practices, customs, and artifacts, making them more accessible to a wider audience. Moreover, pilot projects can be implemented to demonstrate the compatibility of traditional cultures and technological development. For example, in some countries, technology is being used to create digital platforms for traditional artisans to showcase and sell their products, thereby preserving traditional crafts and providing economic benefits to the artisans.Furthermore, technology can also be used to enhance traditional cultural events and practices, making them more engaging and appealing to younger generations. For example, virtual reality technology can be used to recreate traditional festivals and ceremonies, allowing people to experience and participate in them remotely. This not only helps to preserve traditional cultures but also makes them more inclusive and accessible to people with disabilities or those living in remote areas.In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the view that traditional cultures will be lost as technology develops. Instead, I believe that technology can be a powerful tool for preserving and promoting traditional cultures, and that both can coexist and benefit from each other. By leveraging technology to support traditional cultures, we can ensure their continuation and transmission to future generations.

Never has this area been exploded before so researchers could discover crucial information for thesis and tourists could appreciate a fabulous landscape. However, discovering those faraway environments could increase environment-related issues such as climatic change.South Pole is a place which has ever seen human activities before, and it seems to have numerous discoveries to make. Indeed, scientists which fauna and flora are the current studies, could find new mode of the marine life and discover new species. Moreover, people who are interested in travelling to South Pole might now do it, children who dreamed about polar animals could see them. Thus, the tourism should create new jobs and develop economic growth.Nevertheless, as each breakthrough that the society does, there are repercussions. In this case, the harmful effect of this discovery is global warming because when humans go somewhere, they let a carbon footprint which directly changes the environment. For instance, if individuals had to travel to South Pole, they would only use air or marine transport such as cruise ship which pollute the area with greenhouse gases. As a result, those greenhouse gases can warm nature which, unfortunately, would melt the ice and have a detrimental impact on the landscapes. As a consequence, in the forthcoming decades, this panorama may disappear. Thereby, if scientists want to study this natural area, they could not or in a limited way.To conclude, the advantages could be to discover new landscapes and how species can live in this hostile area. However, just going into this remote natural environment could destroy it before discovering something.;The advent of travel to remote natural environments, such as the South Pole, has sparked a heated debate about the advantages and disadvantages of this development. On the one hand, the South Pole, a place which has never seen human activities before, offers a pristine and untouched environment that is ripe for scientific discovery. Scientists could find new modes of marine life and discover new species, which would be a significant breakthrough in the field of biology and ecology. For instance, the discovery of new species in the Antarctic region has already led to a greater understanding of the evolution of life on Earth.On the other hand, as with each breakthrough that society makes, there are repercussions. The influx of tourists and scientists to the South Pole poses a significant threat to the delicate ecosystem of the region. The presence of humans can lead to pollution, habitat destruction, and disruption of the natural balance of the environment. Moreover, the South Pole is a fragile and sensitive environment that is already under threat from climate change. The increased human activity in the region could exacerbate the problem, leading to irreparable damage to the environment.Furthermore, the development of tourism and scientific research in the South Pole also raises concerns about the impact on the indigenous wildlife. The introduction of non-native species, either intentionally or unintentionally, could have devastating consequences for the native species that are adapted to the extreme conditions of the South Pole. Therefore, while the development of travel to the South Pole offers many advantages, including scientific discovery and economic benefits, it is crucial that these activities are carefully managed and regulated to mitigate the potential disadvantages and ensure the long-term conservation of this unique and fragile environment.
141;Write about the following topic.Many governments think that economic progress is their most important goal. Some people,however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;This is a world that fast developing and full of pollution.there is a worldwide problem whether economic progress is the most important goal when the other types problem are increasing. In my word is economic progress is important than other problems.Firstly,this is an economic world. human life condition is base on their income. For example,there have a village with poor people. They might working hard for live but they must have no time to think about other goal. This is reason why the governments to develop social economic . it is not uncommon that government have no money to solve the problem that environment pollution and others.Second, although economic progress is necessary for people but it also lead to other problems. With the increasing income it might need more resources to build the country. If it not solved correctly that give rise to more problems. The other types of progress will have a good developing when the economic progress finished and the government get enough money.Overall , i prefer economic progress to other types of progress. The better life come from money and the solution of the other types problem are come from the good economy.;The notion that economic progress is the most important goal for governments has sparked a heated debate. On one hand, many governments prioritize economic growth, believing it to be the key to a country's success. On the other hand, some individuals argue that other types of progress, such as environmental and social progress, are equally important. In my opinion, economic progress takes precedence over other types of progress, especially in today's fast-developing and pollution-plagued world.In a world where development is rapid and environmental degradation is rampant, it is imperative for governments to focus on economic growth. This is because economic progress has a direct impact on the standard of living of citizens. The better life, as I would put it, comes from money. With a strong economy, individuals have access to better education, health care, and infrastructure, ultimately leading to improved living standards. For instance, countries like Singapore and South Korea have prioritized economic growth and have seen significant improvements in the quality of life for their citizens.While environmental and social progress are crucial, I believe that economic progress is the foundation upon which these other types of progress can be built. Without a strong economy, governments lack the resources to invest in environmental protection and social welfare programs. Furthermore, economic progress can also drive innovation, creating new technologies and solutions to combat pollution and other environmental issues. In conclusion, while other types of progress are important, I firmly believe that economic progress is the most important goal for governments, as it provides the foundation for a better life and has a direct impact on the well-being of citizens.
555;Write about the following topic.Many parents today organise extra classes for their children after school and at the weekends.Do you feel that this is a worthwhile thing to do or do you feel children have enough education at school?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays educational institutions are equipped with devices that were unimaginable only a few years ago, which offer many opportunities to children to study every kind of subject. In other words, the technology introduced in schools helps many children to learn various subjects with different gadgets, such geography, art, maths by computers or history by means of audio-visual-techniques. However, I believe that children thanks to these appealing methods of learning have enough education and they need some time to unwind and experience their life with other activites.To begin with, apply children to extra classes at the weekends has become an issue of debate by many people. I hold firmly to the belief that children after schools need to dedicate their free time on sports. However, sports and other physical activities help young people to enhance their concentration, self-esteem and cognitive skills, social skills with their peer group. For example the most popular and suitable to children are sports with teams, such as football, basketball etc... where children could learn how to collaborate with other mates and the leadership skills gained in sports can help kids to excel in school, life and in the workplace, such as organising a good teamwork.On the other hand, there are few parents who argue that children need to attend extra classes at schools during the weekends. For instance, the world is still facing a global pandemic of covid-19, which caused many problems of attendency of students in many educational institutions due to various measures introduced. However this led many students to lazyness and reduction of methods of gaining knowledge, because it is widely believed that online lessons are not interactive as the lessons in presence. Moreover using continously a technological gadget for hours may cause distraction and negative mental effects. So the better solution for some people is to let their children do extra classes in presence in order to make up for the hours lost during the online lessons.To sum up, children need to experience different activities afterschool in order to have a good educational career. However some parents consider the extra classes an acceptable opportunity to not lose the methods of studying.;The trend of parents organizing extra classes for their children outside of regular school hours has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that these additional classes provide a competitive edge, I firmly believe that children have enough education at school and need time to unwind and explore other aspects of life. Applying children to extra classes at the weekends has become a contentious issue,In my opinion, children thanks to these appealing methods of learning have enough education and they need some time to unwind and experience their life with other activities. By attending school, they are already exposed to a wide range of subjects and learning techniques,I hold firmly to the belief that children after school need to dedicate their free time to sports, hobbies, or other extracurricular activities that promote physical and mental well-being. This allows them to develop essential life skills, such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving, while also fostering creativity and self-expression. For instance, participating in sports can help children build confidence, In conclusion, while extra classes may seem like a good idea, I believe that children have enough education at school and should be given the opportunity to explore other interests and activities outside of the classroom. By doing so, we can help them become well-rounded, happy, and healthy individuals who are equipped to succeed in all aspects of life.
305;Write about the following topic.Many people use written language in a less formal and more relaxed way. Why? Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, written language is used in comparatively more informal and relaxed way. I assume that it happens because of the need of making communication easier and faster. Without features of formal written language it is simplier to share your idea in a shorter period of time. This option is essential in a modern temp of life. This essay will cover both advantages and disadvantages of this development.The less formal and tense written language provides some pros. First of all, without formalization the process of communication requires less amount of time. Then letters consists of less number of symbols and can help to solve the discussed problem much faster. Moreover, this way of communication does not support formal borders between members of a dialogue. Then it is easier to come closer with the interlocutor and feel no pressure during the using of written language.On the other hand, development of making written language more informal and relaxed has some cons. Firstly, communication goes less respectful. Then interlocutors have almost no opportunity to pay a respect to each other. Formalized written language is significant in issue of social borders that can hihlight a paid respect. Secondly, sometimes the main gist of the letter goes unclear, because informal language is more relaxed. In these conditions, the quidity of the letter can be hidden with less formal features. If participants of the communication are not close, they will not understand each other correctly.In conclusion I would like to say that the process of using written language in a more informal way has both advantages and disadvantages. It can be revealed in different situations. That is why everyone should have their own opinion based on the information discussed in this essay.;The use of written language has undergone a significant transformation in recent years. Many people now employ written language in a less formal and more relaxed way, without adhering to the traditional features of formal written language. This shift towards informality can be attributed to the increasing need for rapid communication and the desire to convey ideas in a straightforward manner. Without the constraints of formal written language, individuals can express their thoughts and opinions more freely,The less formal and tense written language provides some notable advantages. For instance, it allows for easier and more efficient communication, as people can share their ideas and thoughts without the burden of adhering to strict grammatical rules or complex vocabulary. This informality also facilitates a sense of approachability and camaraderie, making written communication feel more like a conversation with a friend. Furthermore, the simplicity of informal written language enables people to focus on the content of their message rather than its presentation, allowing for more effective expression of ideas.On the other hand, the development of making written language more informal has some cons. The lack of formality can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations, as the tone and intent behind the message may be lost in translation. Additionally, the informality of written language can also lead to a lack of professionalism and respect, particularly in formal or professional settings. For example, using overly casual language in a work email or academic paper can come across as unprofessional and may undermine the credibility of the writer. Nevertheless, the trend towards more informal written language is likely to continue, and it is essential to strike a balance between clarity and formality to ensure effective communication.
1051;"Write about the following topic.Most people have forgotten the meaning behind traditional or religious festivals; during festival periods, people nowadays only want to enjoy themselves.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.";"In recent years, it is argued that many people have lost track of the meaning behind traditional and religious celebrations; Now, people seem to treat these celebrations as another holiday break. The following essay will fully endorse the statement and examine the reasons behind it.Firstly, there are several reasons why people forgot about the message behind celebrations. One of the most significant one is globalisation. As people start connecting with each other through social media worldwide, many people are too distracted with the latest trends and updates. A study from Yales University mentioned that 60% of the population on earth do not persuit the stories about their traditional roots and background. Hence, they do not celebrate festive or cultural events meaningfully. Another important reason is broken families. People who experienced a tough childhood without a male or female parent are not capable of understanding their own traditions and values. Therefore, they do not grasp the concept of cultural celebrations.Moreover, there are also cons to this arguments as people just want to take a holiday break. Although people may argue that it is important to remember the intention behind diverse celebrations, others just want to use the day for self-fulfillment purposes. For example, people would organise a party and invite friends over to their house so they can have a good time. Another argument that people only want enjoyment during festive periods is work-stress related illnesses. The majority of middle class workers are hardworking and dedicated to their job. However, the period of time for holiday breaks are significantly short and they just want to use the celebration events to rest at home. Despite the fact that they are neglecting their duties to demonstrate the meaning behind these celebrations to the younger generations, they also have a right to take care of themselves mentally and physically before others.In conclusion, there are both sides of the argument on why people think others have forgotten the meaning behind event celebrations and why this is not neccesarily true all the time. Personally, I agree that people should always find the meaning behind these celebrations in order to understand themselves better.";The notion that most people have forgotten the meaning behind traditional or religious festivals has garnered significant attention in recent years. It is argued that many people have lost track of the meaning behind traditional and religious celebrations, as they are now more focused on the festivities and merriment that come with these occasions. The following essay will fully endorse the statement and examine the reasons behind it.A study from Yale University mentioned that 60% of the population on earth do not pursue the stories about their traditional roots, highlighting the disconnect between people and the origins of their cultural and religious celebrations. This staggering statistic suggests that the majority of people are no longer interested in understanding the significance and history behind these festivals. Instead, they are more concerned with the entertainment, as well as the food and gifts that accompany these celebrations.For instance, Christmas, which is a significant religious holiday for Christians, has become more of a commercialized event, with people focusing on exchanging gifts and indulging in festive foods, rather than reflecting on the birth of Jesus Christ. Similarly, traditional festivals such as Diwali and Chinese New Year have also become more about the fireworks, decorations, and family gatherings, rather than the cultural and historical significance they hold. In conclusion, it is evident that many people have indeed forgotten the meaning behind traditional and religious festivals, and are now more focused on the enjoyment and celebrations that come with these occasions. As a result, the true significance and importance of these festivals are being lost, and it is essential that we make an effort to revive and preserve the cultural and religious heritage that these festivals represent.

Others, however, think that music can have a negative influence on both.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Music is the moonlight in the gloomy night of life.It is the universal language of mankind.There are mixed opinions about music on whether it is advantageous or not to individuals and society.This essay will discuss about pros and cons of music being part of our life.Some people have a perception that playing or listening to music is not beneficial in any manner. They feel music separates a person from socializing and that it is a form of addiction and distraction.Especially, parents feel that their child's concentration is impacted while multitasking with music and studies.For extroverts its a sort of discomfort or hindrance.Few extroverts feel better to share their feelings and difficulties with others than staying alone and listening to a song. Few recorded instances has suggested that sad music inculcates negative thoughts and aggression while in depression.On the other hand, there are people who think that music having a negative effect on individual and society is completely preposterous.They feel that tunes produces a kind of pleasure which human nature cannot do without.Music is a form of expression of feelings rather than being a hindrance.It greatly helps people to overcome their hurdles.Soothing and melodious music gives a refreshing effect.Jazz and Pop music facilitates society to come together and dance.Concerrts helps certain groups to spend time for relaxation from their busy schedule.Not only that, singing or playing instruments is a form of expression of their feelings.The essay argued that though music is considered to be a distraction , it is a form of rejuvenation to both society and individuals of all age groups.;The universal language of music is played and enjoyed in every society and culture around the world. While some people believe that music only brings benefits to individuals and societies, others argue that it can have a negative influence. In this essay, I will discuss both views and provide my opinion on the matter.On one hand, some people have a perception that playing or listening to music is not beneficial in any manner. They feel that music separates a person from socializing and that it is a form of addiction and distraction. For instance, they might argue that spending too much time listening to music can lead to social isolation, or that certain types of music can promote aggressive behavior. Additionally, they may believe that excessive music consumption can be a hindrance to productivity and academic performance.On the other hand, there are people who think that music having a negative effect on individuals and society is completely preposterous. They argue that music has numerous benefits, including stress relief, improved cognitive function, and enhanced creativity. Music also has the power to bring people together, foster social connections, and promote cultural understanding. For example, music festivals and concerts often attract diverse crowds, promoting unity and a sense of community among attendees. Moreover, music has been used as a therapeutic tool to help individuals cope with mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression.In my opinion, music is a largely beneficial aspect of human culture. While it is possible to overindulge in music, the benefits of moderate music consumption far outweigh the potential drawbacks. Music has the ability to inspire, educate, and unite people across cultures and societies. Therefore, I firmly believe that music is a valuable and essential part of human life, and its positive effects on individuals and societies should be recognized and celebrated.
587;Write about the following topic.Nowadays, sports is a big business with high earnings for professional sports people and companies involved both financially and other ways. Is this a positive or negative development for sports?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is argued that using mobile devices is as antisocial as smoking and that in certain areas smoking has been forbidden so mobile devices should be prohibited as well. I strongly disagree with this statement because this would not solve the initial problem and could turn out expensive as well.Firstly, banning mobile devices from certain places would be exagerated. This is because smoking actually damages your body, while the use of mobile phones is comparatively harmless. For example, a recent research found out that the risk of lung cancer grows by 0,02% with every cigarette, while high screen time has less damaging side effects like the loss of concentration. Altough the use of mobile phones is sometimes antisocial, I think that we should concentrate on the origins of this problem than simply prohibit it in certain areas.Secondly, banning mobile devices would have a regulatory side effect which could be expensive. The government would have to decide on new laws as well as implement them. Furthermore, it would be no easy task for the police to control these rules in an efficient way. As a result, police would struggle with a high workload. Admittely, I have enough faith in our legal system and I am sure that they could manage it but I think that we have more prescious und urgent tasks to concentrate on.In conclusion, I strongly disagree with banning mobile devices in certain areas. However, I admit that we use our phones too much which sometimes leads to antisocial behaviour. Nevertheless, prohibiting the phones in certain areas would not solve this problem and could as well be expensive for the government.;I must point out that the provided information does not relate to the topic of sports as a big business. Nevertheless, I will address the topic as requested and provide a coherent essay.The notion that sports has become a big business with substantial financial gains for professional athletes and companies is a multifaceted issue. In my opinion, this development has both positive and negative consequences for sports. On the positive side, the increased financial influx has improved the overall quality of sports, with better facilities, equipment, and training methods. For instance, top-tier football clubs can now attract and retain the best players, resulting in more competitive and exciting matches. Additionally, the financial rewards have motivated athletes to push their limits, leading to record-breaking performances and inspiring a new generation of sports enthusiasts.On the negative side, the commercialization of sports has led to an overemphasis on financial success, potentially compromising the integrity and fairness of the game. The influence of money can lead to corruption, doping, and other unethical practices. Furthermore, the high earnings of professional athletes and companies may create an unequal playing field, making it difficult for smaller teams or individual athletes to compete.In conclusion, while the financial growth of sports has its advantages, such as improved quality and increased motivation, it also has drawbacks, including the risk of corruption and unequal competition. To maintain the true spirit of sports, it is essential to strike a balance between financial interests and the core values of fair play and sportsmanship.
1133;Write about the following topic.People in all modern societies use drugs, but today's youth are experimenting with both legal and illegal drugs, and at an increasingly early age. Some sociologists claim that parents and other members of society often set a bad example.Discuss the causes and some effects of widespread drug use by young people in modern day society. Make any recommendations you feel are necessary to help fight youth drug abuse.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The use of drugs has been a warning habit in modern day society. In some research, it shows that households are losing their financing easily due to the fact that one of the parents has been addicted to drugs. Although there are some drugs which were approved by the government to be used moderately, yet some people are using these drugs heavily.This has drawn the attention of the youth either by a drug addict parent or a friend. Moreover, the number of youngsters taking drugs has increased dramatically throughout the years as there are people who provide these drugs in the black market. This critical issue has caused serious issues both socially and mentally.The social and mental impact of using drugs by the youngsters have damaged the educational progress, the social participation such as family and friends gatherings. Additionally, lack of stamina, weight loss, and loss of appetite are key factors of excessive use of drugs.There is a number of contributing elements to the phenomena. One of these elements is the sense of belonging to a group. Since humans are social animals, young people want to have the feeling of being accepted and loved, and this can be sensible when it comes to a group of friends. Therefore, once someone introduces a drug, the rest of the group will try, and if one says no, then they will be rejected. However, this rejection can be helping to solve this alarming issue.The solution is to find a way to distinguish the types of drugs and legalize the ones that do not harm greatly and prepare in parallel the better ways to control the consumption of drugs.;The use of drugs has been a warning habit in modern day society, with widespread consequences for young people. This critical issue has caused serious problems both socially and mentally, affecting not only the individuals but also their families and communities. The social and mental impact of using drugs by youngsters has damaged their educational progress, as they become disengaged from school and their studies, leading to poor academic performance. Furthermore, drug use has also hindered social participation, as young people become isolated and withdrawn, making it difficult for them to form and maintain healthy relationships.Sociologists argue that parents and other members of society often set a bad example, contributing to the early experimentation with both legal and illegal drugs among youth. The causes of this issue are complex and multifaceted, involving factors such as peer pressure, media influence, and ease of access to drugs. Additionally, some young people may turn to drugs as a coping mechanism for stress, anxiety, or other emotional issues. To combat this issue, it is essential to implement effective prevention and intervention strategies. Recommendations include educating young people about the risks and consequences of drug use, providing accessible counseling and support services, and promoting healthy lifestyle choices and activities. Moreover, parents, educators, and community leaders must take responsibility for setting a good example and promoting positive values and behaviors. By working together, we can help to reduce the incidence of drug use among young people and mitigate its harmful effects, ultimately creating a healthier and more supportive society for all. It is crucial that we address this issue promptly, as the consequences of inaction will be severe and long-lasting, damaging the potential and well-being of future generations.

This researches get the attention of the organizations and help them to shape their designs of their offices or buildings. In this essay, I will talk about the affects of colour and its influence on some parts of human's life.It is true that certain colours are affecting our mental state and feelings at some level. Because of our visual plays an important role in our pyschology, colours are becoming important issue that needs to be point out. For example, the alertness effect of red colour on human's feeling is well known by the goverments. In order to alert people, stop signs or traffic lights are always include some level of red colour. This way, humans can be warned and accidents numbers can be decreased.Also, this affect of colours can play a big role in our health and work place.

It is true that certain colours can affect our mental state and feelings, and this concept is being increasingly applied in various settings,The statement that attention should be given to colour schemes when decorating places such as offices and hospitals is indeed true. Colours can have a profound impact on people's health and capacity for work.

Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"In development countries they must allow works for people who have skills and experience employees from poor countries. I agree with this point of view because everyone they should have a chance. There were a opportunities and benefits.The first point, I would like to make is that there were a great opportunities for both rich countries and people who came from poor areas. When people thinking to transfer abroad there were many reason but the most important when they want a chance to show of there craft and ability. Such as, Indian people they travelled many areas and they give them a lot of discoveries and skills; moreover, the rich countries need some people to help to make their country better place for living. For example, I have read an article in the newspaper they talked about development countries like UK, US and Arabic countries they need those people to improve their economy and life.The second point, I will clarify is that there were many benefits when this countries allow jobs for those. They will be equality for all ;furthermore, there will be a improvement in living. For instance, I have saw a T.V decomontry they say "" In United States there are a equality and improvement in live between people they came from Africaand citizens they help them to have good education, skills and experience also they contribute the US economy to growth "".Finally, we can say that there were a opportunities and benefits for both sides. I am with this to have good life for all. I hope in the future poor countries they can take benefits from those people and developed their country to came better than now .";The notion that rich countries should allow jobs for skilled and knowledgeable employees from poor countries is a topic of significant debate. I wholeheartedly agree with this point of view, as it not only promotes global equality but also fosters economic growth and cultural diversity. In development countries, as well as developed ones, it is imperative that they allow work opportunities for people who have skills and experience, regardless of their country of origin. This stance is rooted in the belief that everyone should have an equal chance to succeed, based on their merits and capabilities. By doing so, rich countries can tap into a vast pool of talent and expertise that might not be available locally, while also providing individuals from poor countries with the opportunity to improve their socio-economic status.For instance, many skilled professionals from countries like India, Nigeria, or Brazil have made significant contributions to the economies of countries like the United States, Canada, or the UK. These individuals bring with them unique perspectives, skills, and experiences that can enrich the workplace and society at large. Moreover, by working in rich countries, these employees can send remittances back home, which can significantly contribute to the economic development of their home countries.Furthermore, in today's interconnected world, the free movement of skills and knowledge is as important as the free movement of goods and services. It promotes a global workforce that is based on competence rather than nationality. Therefore, I firmly believe that allowing skilled and knowledgeable employees from poor countries to work in rich countries is not only a moral imperative but also an economic necessity. It's a step towards a more equitable and interconnected world where opportunities are based on an individual's abilities, not their birthplace. By embracing diversity and talent from all corners of the globe, we can build a more prosperous and harmonious world for everyone.
973;Write about the following topic.Some organisations believe that their employees should dress smartly. Others value quality of work above appearance.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Manners in the workplace have always been a topic that is discussed by many people as it is essential to know how we should behave in such a formal environment. Some companies give the opinion that their workers should have a smart look while others consider the attitude toward the job more important.To my mind, appearance should not the only thing to be considered. We can dress smartly and impress others, but it is only the first impression. Therefore, productivity, quality of work, and the way we are responsible for our tasks are things that make us outstanding workers. Moreover, it is obvious that the success of one company does not depend on how its employees dress but on how it is organized.In spite of the fact that dressing does not play a key role in the value of a worker, a neat and intelligent appearance still gives us significant benefits. I always suggest that one should dress suitably in different situations. In fact, it is not crucial for an organization to ask their employees to dress formally, but a set of smart casual clothes is something that we should wear when it comes to the working environment. It is because that wearing politely shows how we respect our jobs, our employers, and even our workmates. In some cases, a company's professionalism can be seen through the way its workers wear.To sum up, dressing smartly is not the best and only thing that one worker can do to have better performance. However, having a good appearance is something that great employees would do since it can be considered as their respect for the jobs.;The debate about whether employees should prioritize dressing smartly or focusing on the quality of their work has been ongoing among organizations. On one hand, some companies emphasize the importance of their workers having a smart and professional appearance, believing that it reflects positively on the company's image and reputation. They argue that a well-dressed employee is more likely to make a good impression on clients and colleagues, which can lead to increased business opportunities and a more respectful work environment.On the other hand, some organizations take a more relaxed approach to dress code, valuing the quality of work above appearance. They believe that an employee's productivity, creativity, and work ethic are far more important than what they wear. To my mind, appearance should not be the only thing to be considered. What truly makes an employee outstanding is their ability to deliver high-quality work, their productivity, and their sense of responsibility towards their tasks. A smart dress code does not necessarily translate to a job well done.In fact, many successful companies, such as tech giants, have adopted casual dress codes, focusing on their employees' comfort and ability to think creatively rather than their attire. This approach has proven to boost employee morale, motivation, and overall job satisfaction, leading to better work outcomes. Therefore, while dressing smartly can be beneficial in certain contexts, it is the quality of work, productivity, and sense of responsibility that truly define an exceptional employee. Organizations should prioritize these aspects, allowing employees to focus on delivering outstanding results rather than just looking the part.

Others believe that some information is too important or too valuable to be shared freely.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In recent years, some people believe that it is good to share information about scientific research, business and the academic field to many people. Others reckon that such informations are too important or too valuable to be share for free. Here are discussions of the statements and my opinion.By development of the technology, people can more likely to access to valuable information such as experimental results and interviewing results of citizens than before. Some people use it for their academic interests or for the business strategies, so that people believe that such information contribute to companies profits or individuals' advantages in academic. For example, many of the medical students read dissertation of diseases, which were written in the past. By reading and using the scientific information students will become excellent professionals.On the other hand, people can access informations from any countries via internet. Recently, increasing the cyber crimes is the serious problem all over the world. Therefore some people reckon that it is too risky to share valuable informations. If information on valuable national research results is leaked, the country would had enormous loss for the economy.To sum up ,sharing as much informations as possible is useful for the everyone to improve their academic skills and contribute to their companies, while easier access to every aspects of informations might bring disadvantages such as information leakage or cybercrime. In my opinion, I mostly agree with it is good to share information, but I believe the source of information needs to be careful not to misuse the sources.;The debate about sharing information in scientific research, business, and the academic world has sparked intense discussion in recent years. On one hand, some people believe that it is beneficial to share as much information as possible in these fields, as it can lead to groundbreaking discoveries, innovative solutions, and accelerated progress. By making research findings, business strategies, and academic knowledge accessible to a wider audience, individuals can build upon existing ideas, collaborate, and drive advancements. For instance, the open-source movement in software development has led to the creation of highly successful and widely-used operating systems, demonstrating the power of shared information.On the other hand, others argue that some information is too important or too valuable to be shared freely. They contend that sensitive data, proprietary business strategies, and cutting-edge research findings can be exploited by competitors, compromised by unauthorized use, or even pose risks to national security if fallen into the wrong hands. For example, pharmaceutical companies invest heavily in research and development, and sharing their findings without patent protection could undermine their ability to recoup investments. Similarly, academic institutions may be hesitant to share sensitive research data, such as personal medical information, to protect participant confidentiality.In my opinion, a balanced approach is necessary. While sharing information can drive progress and collaboration, it is equally important to protect sensitive, valuable, or potentially hazardous information. Governments, businesses, and academic institutions should establish clear guidelines and regulations to ensure that information is shared responsibly, with appropriate safeguards and protections in place. By doing so, we can harness the benefits of shared knowledge while minimizing the risks, ultimately promoting a culture of collaboration, innovation, and responsible information sharing.
273;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Environmental problems are the biggest issue that people have to concern and by product form fossil fuels is one of causes. Someone think one way that can reduce result from fuels is sale car fuels in higher price. In my opinion, I disagree with this because highly price of oil leads to other problems such as financial problem and impact to food price, moreover, we can heal their environment by other ways.The negative effects of increasing the cost of vehciles fuels are improtant to human life. The significant points is price of basic requirements, for instance, foods and medicines which have to transportation by trucks that use oil fuels for movement. The expensive fuels increase business costs, so their products price are rising up. Futhermore, social problems follow by financial problems. When poor people do not have money but they still hunger, they will steal some food or water this situation roads to social problems.Other ways to reduce environment problems, the causes of this problem are not only fossil fuel but also agricultural or industial aspect which we have to focus on. Intustial areas are the top areas that make lot of pollutions such as air pollution, water pollution from thier procesing and chemical pollution which they use during process. Those of them lead to many problems and effect to qulity of human life. Moveover agricultural areas, there produce many of gas which result to global warming.In conclusion, the increasing car fuels might reduce some of environmental problems but also have drawback to population life. We should to chooce other ways to protect enviromant without effect to our life.;The notion that increasing the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles is an effective solution to environmental problems has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that this approach can reduce carbon emissions and promote eco-friendly alternatives, I strongly disagree with this stance. In my opinion, the negative effects of increasing the cost of vehicle fuels far outweigh the potential benefits, particularly with regards to their impact on human life.One significant point to consider is the price of basic requirements, such as food and medicine. When fuel costs rise, the transportation costs of these essential items also increase, leading to higher prices for consumers. This can have devastating effects on low-income households, who may struggle to afford basic necessities. For instance, a surge in fuel prices can lead to an increase in the cost of food, making it difficult for people to access nutritious meals. Similarly, the cost of medicine and healthcare services may also rise, putting a strain on already vulnerable individuals.Furthermore, expensive fuels can increase business costs, leading to higher prices for their products. This can have a ripple effect throughout the economy, making it difficult for businesses to remain competitive and for consumers to afford everyday items. The increased cost of fuel can also lead to higher costs for logistics and transportation, which can be particularly challenging for small businesses and startups. Ultimately, increasing the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles may not be an effective solution to environmental problems, as it can have far-reaching and detrimental effects on human life and the economy. Alternative solutions, such as investing in renewable energy sources and promoting sustainable transportation options, may be more effective in addressing environmental concerns while minimizing the negative impact on human life.
135;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that school children should not be given homework by their teachers, whereas others argue that homework plays an important role in the education of children.Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The issue that whether teachers should assign homework or not has attracted great attention recently.Some people believe that homework is a good way to consolidate students'learning effect.However,others argue that homework exerts huge pressure on students,which is bad for their long-term development.As for me,appropriate homework should be seen as the better choice.I will explain my idea from two aspects.Firstly,homework could examine student's learning results.After teaching the basic content,giving some homework is important to consolidate the knowledge.As an old saying goes,practice makes things perfect.Only doing many practices,can we master the knowledge proficiently.There is an example.In my teaching experiences,I found the students finishing their homework better would achieve higher scores in final examination,while those who couldn't finish their ordinary homework would gain lower grades in any examination.And my translation skills were also improved by practicing the homework from my guiders who gave the targeted examination to me.Secondly,too much homework will cause so many negative effects,such as making students tired very much,causing their depressed mood and their bored emotion.For example,my brother's daughter always suffered from the huge homework which was assigned by his Chinese teacher.She once complained with me that everyday she felt tired and bored after finishing Chinese teacher's assignments.So appropriate homework is reasonable for most students and those ideas that the more homework,the better students' scores ,are wrong to certain extent.Sometimes huge homework is the reason that why some students'scores are reduced.In sum,removing homework is not an ideal option for student's improvement in learning,and reasonable homework provides us a better way to deal with the problem.That is to say,we should strike a balance between assigning homework and removing homework.;The debate about whether school children should be given homework by their teachers has sparked intense discussion in recent years. On one hand, some people believe that homework is a good way to consolidate students' learning effect, as it reinforces the concepts and skills learned in the classroom, allowing students to better retain the information. For instance, a math problem set can help students practice and apply mathematical concepts, thereby solidifying their understanding. This, in turn, can lead to improved academic performance and a stronger foundation for future learning.On the other hand, others argue that homework exerts huge pressure on students, which is bad for their long-term development. Excessive homework can lead to stress, anxiety, and a negative attitude towards learning, ultimately affecting students' mental and physical well-being. Furthermore, it can also limit the time available for other essential activities such as sports, reading, and socializing, which are crucial for a child's overall development.As for me, appropriate homework should be seen as the better choice. Rather than abolishing homework entirely, teachers should aim to assign homework that is meaningful, relevant, and manageable. This approach can help maintain a balance between reinforcing learning and avoiding undue pressure. When homework is tailored to the individual needs and abilities of students, it can be a valuable tool for enhancing their educational experience. Therefore, a thoughtful and balanced approach to homework is essential, ensuring that students can reap its benefits while minimizing its drawbacks. By doing so, we can promote a healthy and effective learning environment that supports the overall growth and development of school children.
525;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child's development while others think that it is important for children to go to school.Discuss the advantages of both methods and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In regards to the notion 'it is important for children to go to school', there are two contrasting opinions of supporting it and also disagreeing with it. Schools are conceptually thought to be essential and compulsory for many parents while others may not despite of what the society says.There are people who suggest that going to school is indeed necessary for children and students as it enables them to develop social ability and make friends which will ultimately be useful in the future. Attending school, a microsom of society, itself already teaches young students how to interact with other people ouside of family tree. Those who did not attend school when they were young may have severly low EQ or lacking interaction ability. For instance, an adult who was studying at home might not know how to respect and share objects with others. By being enrolled in a school, children can make remarkable childhood memories that may help them in the future when they are in a slump or depression.On the other hand, some people may disagree to this notion as they think studying at home is far more effective. Their argument might be that going to school would be a waste of time as children usually play around at school. Teaching children can be much more efficient as transportation time and playing time can be eliminatied by not going to school. Furthermore, as children do not have to go out, there will not be any conflicts on bullying or fight with friends. They will not fall onto deviation such as smoking, drinking et cetera which are usually encountered at school due to bad friends. Also, money can be saved by teaching at home as uniforms, for example, do not have to purchased.All in all, although young students might have number of advantages by not going to school, it is nevertheless more important to attend school in a daily basis to improve their social ability and interaction with other people.;"The debate on whether children should be taught at home or in a school setting has sparked intense discussion among parents and educators. The notion that ""it is important for children to go to school"" is conceptually thought to be essential and compulsory for many parents, while others may not share the same view. Proponents of traditional schooling argue that it enables children to develop social skills and make friends, which are crucial for their emotional and psychological growth. Schools provide a platform for children to interact with peers from diverse backgrounds, On the other hand, some people may disagree with this notion as they think studying at home is far more effective. They argue that home schooling allows for personalized attention and a tailored learning experience, which can be particularly beneficial for children with special needs or those who require extra support. Moreover, home schooling can provide a safe and comfortable learning environment,In my opinion, I believe that attending school is essential for a child's development. Schools offer a structured and disciplined environment that fosters a sense of responsibility and accountability. Moreover, schools provide access to a wide range of resources, including libraries, laboratories, and sports facilities, which can enhance the learning experience. While home schooling has its advantages, I think that the benefits of traditional schooling outweigh them. For instance, schools provide opportunities for children to participate in extracurricular activities, such as sports, music, and art, which can help them develop new skills and interests. Additionally, schools provide a platform for children to learn from experienced teachers and interact with peers who can provide support and motivation. Overall, while both methods have their advantages, I firmly believe that attending school is the best option for a child's development."
323;Write about the following topic.Some people believe women are better leaders than men. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is argued by some individuals that men aren't skilled enough as women in regard to leadership. This essay disagrees with the given statement as leadership skills are not depending on gender but are strongly related to people's personality and work experience.The role of a leader should not be stereotyped according to gender, for example, women might be considered more powerful than men because they could normally appear more organised and perfectionist. Indeed, several studies concerning leadership and the role of the leader, have demonstrated that some people have innate attitudes of a leader regardless of their gender. Some of those attitudes are related to active listening, emotional intelligence skills and great communication abilities. Thus, if effectively developed and fostered, those skills can support individuals to achieve higher roles in leadership and management.In the same way, the working experience also plays a crucial role in determining and further developing leadership skills. For example, a large number of women are still renouncing to their career paths in order to care for their families. Indeed, most of the women, apply for part-time roles which do not offer the opportunity to achieve a leadership role despite their abilities. For this reason, is difficult to affirm if women are better than men in leadership.To conclude, the role of a leader is shaped by innate characteristics and people's personalities regardless of their gender. Moreover, the poor presence of women employed in leadership roles does not create pieces of evidence to support such a point of view.;The notion that women are better leaders than men is a topic of ongoing debate. While some people may agree with this statement, I tend to disagree,. In my opinion, leadership skills are not dependent on gender, but are strongly related to a person's personality and work experience. Effective leaders possess qualities such as strong communication skills, strategic thinking, and the ability to inspire and motivate others, regardless of their gender.Historically, men have dominated leadership positions, but this does not necessarily mean they are inherently better leaders. Many women have demonstrated exceptional leadership skills, such as Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany, and Jacinda Ardern, the Prime Minister of New Zealand. These women have proven themselves to be capable and effective leaders, but their success is not solely due to their gender. Rather, it is a result of their hard work, dedication, and strong leadership abilities.However, it is also important to acknowledge that a large number of women are still renouncing their career paths in order to care for their families. This can limit their opportunities for leadership development and advancement. Societal expectations and gender roles can also influence women's decisions to pursue leadership positions. To truly determine whether women are better leaders than men, we need to create a more level playing field, where both men and women have equal opportunities to develop their leadership skills and pursue leadership roles.In conclusion, while some women may exhibit exceptional leadership skills, it is unfair to generalize that women are better leaders than men. Leadership abilities are not inherent to gender, but rather a result of individual personality, work experience, and opportunities. By recognizing and addressing the societal and cultural barriers that prevent women from pursuing leadership roles, we can work towards creating a more equitable and merit-based leadership landscape.
247;Write about the following topic.Some people feel that manufacturers and supermarkets have the responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging of goods. Others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Packing of goods has become a noticeable issue nowadays, especially in terms of environmental concerns and sustainable development of society. In order to reduce the amount of packaging, some people believe that manufacturers and supermarkets are more responsible for taking measures, while others insist that customers play a more critical role in reality. In my view, the effort needs to be made by the supplier and the consumer both to guarantee the achievement of the goal.On the one hand, the problem of over-packaging is often caused by commercial strategy. The supplier attempts to use beautiful packaging to make their products more attractive to customers. It is fairly easy to imagine that people would be more likely to choose a product decorated gorgeously than the same one with a plain appearance provided that there is thus no significant increase in price. Following that, producers would try to make every effort to obtain more competitive packaging for their products, which probably leads to excessive use of the wrap. Therefore, it is undoubtedly the duty of the producer to partake in reducing the amount of over-packaging by finding another way to improve the competitiveness of their products instead of merely attaching more value to their appearance.On the other hand, the behaviors of customers give rise to over-packaging as well. The more attention that people will pay to the appearance of goods, the more encouraged producers will be to exert themselves on wrapping. Moreover, the public awareness about the harmful influence of over-packaging is also profound in decreasing the amount of packaging. As customers take the problems caused by over-packaging into account, they would be more willing to purchase the goods with less packaging, which is a highly practical way to prevent producers from wrapping unduly.In conclusion, it is clear that suppliers and customers both are responsible for the trend of over-packaging. Therefore, the success of altering the situation needs the participation of them both.;The packing of goods has become a noticeable issue nowadays, with excessive packaging contributing to environmental problems such as waste and pollution. The question of who should take responsibility for reducing packaging has sparked a debate, with some people believing that manufacturers and supermarkets are more responsible for taking measures, while others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with excessive packaging.On the one hand, some people believe that manufacturers and supermarkets have a significant role to play in reducing packaging. They argue that these businesses have the resources and expertise to develop and implement sustainable packaging solutions. For instance, supermarkets can switch to biodegradable packaging materials and manufacturers can design products with minimal packaging. By taking these steps, they can significantly reduce the amount of waste generated by packaging.On the other hand, others argue that customers should take the lead in reducing packaging by making conscious purchasing decisions. They believe that if customers refuse to buy goods with excessive packaging, the demand for such products will decrease, forcing manufacturers and supermarkets to adapt. However, in my view, the effort needs to be made by the supplier and the consumer both to guarantee the achievement of the goal. It is unrealistic to expect one party to solely bear the responsibility. A collaborative approach, where manufacturers and supermarkets reduce packaging and customers make informed choices, is more likely to lead to significant reductions in packaging waste.In conclusion, reducing packaging is a collective responsibility that requires the effort of both suppliers and consumers. By working together, we can reduce the environmental impact of packaging and promote sustainable consumption practices. Ultimately, a combined approach will be more effective in addressing the issue of excessive packaging and promoting a more sustainable future.
181;Write about the following topic.Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding change. Others, however, think that change is always a good thing.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people rather doing the same things over and over avoiding change, meanwhile others consider change as a positive thing. Some people are probably afraid of change and for this reason they prefer staying in the confort zone because it's something familiar. On the other hand, others believe that change is a good opportunity to grow and discover new things.Changing it's not for everybody, because there are people that doesn't like it, so they try to avoid it. Spending the whole life doing the same thing is not as bad as change for some people. This is probably linked to the fact that sometime change is something unknown. So, sometime people prefere to stay in their confort zone because even if it's not the best at least is something familiar. For example, people that hate their jobs but are stuck with it, is because they're too afraid to change it and land in a worse place or position. So they rather stay in that place because they're too afraid to lose it and end up worse. I believe that this is an understandable and common reason around people, however i believe that change can give more chances for improvement.Other people believes that change is always a positive thing. Changing is an opportunity to grow and discover new things, It's a chance to achieve something better and improve. There are people who doesn't like to be in the same place (phisically, economically or emotionally) and prefer changing. For instance, going to a new country because the idea of living in the same place forever is not charming enough, so find out new places to see, and places to feel confortable ,emotionally and economically for instance, is something that only people who are hungry enough of change would do it. I believe that sometime it's better risk it than live the same life everyday.In conclusion, the preference about change depends on people and wheter is beneficial or not depends on the different point of views and situations. I think, that change is important, everything change even if try to avoid it. So, it's better embrace it because no matter how things go it will leave you either with an experiece or with a lesson. So, in my opinion change is a good thing.;The debate about whether change is beneficial or detrimental has been ongoing for a long time. On one hand, some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding change. They find comfort in routine and predictability, and the thought of altering their daily lives is daunting. For instance, a person who has worked in the same company for years may feel uneasy about switching jobs or industries, even if it means a pay raise or better opportunities. This aversion to change can provide a sense of security and stability, allowing individuals to focus on their strengths and expertise.On the other hand, others consider change as a positive thing. They believe that change is essential for growth, personal development, and innovation. According to them, change can bring new experiences, skills, and perspectives, leading to a more fulfilling life. For example, a person who has always lived in the same city may decide to move abroad, which can broaden their cultural understanding, help them learn a new language, and make new friends. This openness to change can lead to increased adaptability, resilience, and a more dynamic lifestyle.In my opinion, change is not for everybody, and there are valid reasons why some people may try to avoid it. While change can be beneficial, it can also be overwhelming and stressful. Moreover, some individuals may have had negative experiences with change in the past, making them wary of it. However, I also believe that a balanced approach to change is necessary. Embracing some level of change can prevent stagnation and encourage personal growth, but it should be done at a pace that is comfortable and manageable for each individual. Ultimately, whether change is good or bad depends on the individual's personality, preferences, and circumstances.

While some people believe that the availability of resources and welfare in metropolises can outweigh the unhealthy environment, I strongly believe that the fancy infrastructures come in exchange for health sacrifice.To begin with, most megacities are overpopulated. With scarce resources and higher demands in every aspect, products and services received in these bustling locations usually come at a higher price, lower quality and longer waiting time. For example, it could take up to weeks or months to queue up for non-urgent medical services while it takes only a few days or even without booking in non-busy areas. Moreover, the nature of crowded areas accelerates the spreading of transmittable diseases during the pandemic.Another undeniable health factor for those residing in cities is pollution. Most cities come with traffic issues where there are exceeding amounts of cars which create air pollution. It is proved that, in long term, smog in the air could result in respiratory diseases such as lung cancer. Furthermore, the number of the city's population is equal to the extremely large amount of waste and without an appropriate waste management system, it could lead to several more problems. One of them is pests such as mice and bugs which are the perfect mediums for severe diseases such as rabies.All in all, urbanization has tremendous benefits to human society as a whole and is unavoidable in the present context. Thus, governments should focus on addressing these issues to ensure the sustainable progress of cities and the citizens' quality of life.;The notion that living in big cities is detrimental to people's health is a topic of ongoing debate. In my opinion, I agree to a large extent that urban dwelling can have adverse effects on one's well-being. Over the past decades, the rise of urbanization has brought about trends of moving into cities, which has led to a surge in demand for resources, products, and services. However, these necessities often come at a higher price, are of lower quality, and require longer waiting times, ultimately affecting the overall quality of life.Furthermore, the nature of crowded areas in cities accelerates the spreading of transmittable diseases, as witnessed during the pandemic. The high density of population in urban areas creates an ideal environment for diseases to spread rapidly, putting residents at a higher risk of infection. Another undeniable health factor for those residing in cities is pollution. The excessive emissions from vehicles, industrial activities, and construction work contribute to poor air quality, which can lead to respiratory problems and other health issues.The scarcity of green spaces and the lack of opportunities for physical activity in urban environments also contribute to a sedentary lifestyle, which is a significant risk factor for various chronic diseases. In conclusion, while cities offer numerous opportunities for social, economic, and cultural development, the health drawbacks of urban living cannot be overlooked. Therefore, it is essential for city planners and policymakers to prioritize the creation of sustainable, healthy, and livable urban environments to mitigate the negative impacts of city living on residents' health.

On one hand, some individuals think that art lessons in school are a luxury that the education system can ill afford. They argue that teachers should focus on science subjects, such as physics, chemistry, and biology, which are deemed more practical and useful in everyday life. According to this view, the time spent on art could be better utilized to improve students' academic performance in core subjects like mathematics, science, and language.On the other hand, others believe that art lessons are just as important in school as math, science, and language. They argue that art education helps children develop their creativity, imagination, and self-expression. Art lessons can also improve cognitive skills, such as critical thinking and problem-solving, which are valuable assets in all areas of life. Furthermore, art can provide an outlet for students to express their emotions and ideas, promoting mental health and well-being. For instance, art classes can help students with learning difficulties or disabilities to communicate and interact with their peers in a more engaging and effective way.In my opinion, art is an essential subject for children at school. It provides a unique platform for students to explore their creativity and imagination, which is vital for their overall development. By incorporating art into the school curriculum, educators can foster a more holistic learning experience, preparing students for a wide range of careers and opportunities. Rather than viewing art as a waste of time, it should be recognized as a valuable complement to science, math, and language education, helping to create well-rounded and innovative individuals.

I strongly disagree with this opinion. I think that state policy cannot lead to the people's obesity. Moreover, I am sure that only parents are responsible for their children diseases.First of all, it is important to say that government's actions can not be followed with the obesity. It is responsible only for control that all available products are not dangerous for people's health. Food that consist of a lot of fats do not put your health under the threat after the first consumption. Only overeating of this kind of food can be harmful for your health leading obesity. For instance, there is no government's responsibility if you go to the mall and buy 6 cans of beer providing health problem for yourself. I am sure that government is responsible only for making 1 can of beer acceptable for your health.Secondly, children's actions and potential consequences of these actions should be controlled by their parents. Obesity can be a result of a permanent overeating. Because of their age, chilldren cannot control themselves. That is why this responsibility goes on their parents. As it was mentioned before, there is no product that can be harmful for the healh after the first and the only consumption. There is no reason to condemn government because of the permanent consumption of any products. For example, child could eat 3 pieces of cake insted of 1 just because of his wish. In this case, his parents should stop him after the first one to avoid potential obesity.In conclusion, I would like to say that I do not see any reasons to say that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children. It has no responsibility for people's overeating and lack of parents' control over their children.;The notion that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children has gained significant attention in recent years. However, I strongly disagree with this opinion. While it is believed that responsibility for this trend lies with the government, I argue that their role is limited to ensuring that all available products are not dangerous for people's health.The primary responsibility for controlling children's actions and potential consequences should be shouldered by their parents. Parents have the duty to educate their children about the importance of a balanced diet and regular exercise. They should also set a good example by adopting healthy habits themselves, as children often mimic the behavior of their elders. Furthermore, parents have the authority to control the food their children consume and the amount of time they spend on sedentary activities such as watching TV or playing video games.Government can only do so much by regulating the food industry and promoting public health campaigns. However, it is ultimately up to the parents to make informed decisions about their children's lifestyle and diet. For instance, parents can encourage their children to engage in sports or other physical activities,In conclusion, the government's role is crucial but limited in controlling the rise in obesity in children. Parents should take an active role in monitoring and guiding their children's eating habits and lifestyle choices. By doing so, they can help prevent obesity and promote a healthy lifestyle for their children. Therefore, I firmly believe that parents, not the government, are responsible for the rise in obesity in children.

But others think taking part in individual sports is better, like swimming. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"There are lots of benifits in both party of sports which is group sports and individual sports. Many argue that one is better than another. By analyzing my personal experience, both side advantages and disadvanteges will be discussed.Health, the main factor that make people doing the sport in some extent. Many sports help body to increase the metabolism and keep our figure look slim. For example, like swiming, the sport is well-known for beauty body buidling, many reaserch show that water pressure form muscle into more dynamic beautiful shape than any other sport regardless of safty issues which part of events were practice in open water.Compare to swiming, a group sport like soccer game need 22 players participate into the field. Average soccer player have very powerful core strenth, in order to compete in this match, soccer player need to wear certain protection to prevent from injury such as foot pad to reduce the impact from side kick from other players and ankel protector. Undoubtly, soccer players have most strong body among many sports. However, they are the group of people most likely get injuryed more frequently.Sport also can build trust and friendship between people. In this aspect, both individual sports and group sports are proven that partipating in group games or competing with another player on a 1v1 match can increase the improvement of sportsmanship between people. Like olympic motto, ""stonger, faster and higher"", a good sport can bring people together and compete each other in a fair and friendly enviornment. However, individual sport may get boring faster than group sports due to lack of competition.In conclusion, neither group sports nor individual sports are perfect in every aspects. It is important to found a sport suit for each individual personal interest. All kinds of sports always carry benifits with dangerous if people do not do it well.";The debate about whether participating in team sports or individual sports is more beneficial has been ongoing for years. While some people believe that team sports like football offer more advantages, others argue that individual sports like swimming are better. In this essay, I will discuss both views, analyze my personal experience, and provide my opinion.On the one hand, team sports offer numerous benefits, such as promoting teamwork, communication, and social skills. Playing in a team environment teaches individuals how to work towards a common goal, build relationships, and develop camaraderie. For instance, football players learn to rely on each other's strengths and weaknesses to achieve victory. Additionally, team sports often provide a sense of belonging and accountability, as teammates motivate and support each other.On the other hand, individual sports like swimming, tennis, or gymnastics also have their advantages. These sports allow athletes to focus on their personal goals, set their own pace, and track their progress. Individual sports also promote self-discipline, time management, and self-motivation, as athletes are solely responsible for their performance. From my personal experience, I have found that individual sports help me develop a stronger sense of self-awareness, allowing me to identify my strengths and weaknesses, and work on improving myself.In conclusion, there are lots of benefits in both party of sports, which is group sports and individual sports. By analyzing my personal experience, I believe that both types of sports have their advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, the choice between team sports and individual sports depends on personal preferences, goals, and priorities. I think that participating in both team and individual sports can provide a well-rounded experience, allowing individuals to develop a range of skills, socially, physically, and mentally. Therefore, I recommend that people try out different types of sports to find what suits them best and enjoy the numerous benefits that sports have to offer.
189;Write about the following topic.Some people think that we should divide students based on their academic ability, while others think we should educate all students together. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people argue that students who have noticeable abilities and nice educational skills in academics should be separated during the learning process. The other says that it is no object who a better in education who not they should study together. I believe that it is terrible idea to include separation among students.On the one hand, when students with strong and weak academic abilities educate separately, teachers could control the learning process more thoroughly. In this way the teacher could give them more difficult tasks and focus on really relevant topics. A good example of this are private schools with fees and entering exams. It is the fact that there students in final classes have better knowledge than in common schools.On the other hand, when students with different skills educate together the strong students will help weak ones. In these classes there are standards and all students should follow them and there are opportunities to ask schoolmates how to solve some task correctly. The nice example of this is my school. If I did not know how to solve a task I would have a chance to wait for help from my more wise mate.In conclusion, although separate education will give a chance to learn a lot of difficult tasks and it helps teachers, the losing way of asking help if you do not know how to solve the task would be devastating for the educational process. In addition, it could be separated by abilities and wisdom, anyway it is an awful idea.;The debate on whether students should be divided based on their academic ability or educated together has been a longstanding one. Some people argue that students who have noticeable abilities and nice educational skills in academics should be separated during the learning process. They believe that this will enable these gifted students to reach their full potential and accelerate their learning. By separating them, they will be able to receive more challenging and specialized instruction that caters to their needs,On the other hand, when students with different skills educate together, the strong students will help weak ones. This approach promotes a collaborative learning environment where students can learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses. For instance, a student who excels in mathematics can assist a peer who is struggling with the subject,. Similarly, a student who is proficient in writing can help another student who needs guidance on essay composition. This not only fosters a sense of community and teamwork but also allows students to develop essential skills such as communication, empathy, and problem-solving.In my opinion, educating all students together is more beneficial. By doing so, students can learn from each other's diverse perspectives and experiences, which can enrich their understanding of the subject matter. Moreover, it prepares them for real-life situations where they will be working with people of varying abilities and backgrounds. For example, in a workplace setting, employees with different skill sets and strengths are often required to collaborate on projects, making it essential for students to develop these skills from an early age. Therefore, I believe that educating students together is more advantageous, as it promotes a well-rounded education and better prepares them for their future careers.
569;Write about the following topic.Some teachers think that international student exchange would be beneficial for all teenage school students.Do you think its advantages will outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The international student exchange is getting more popular in many high schools in big cities. This operation brings many advantages which would be beneficial for teenager students. Though, here some disadvantages still exist.Firstly, I think one of disadvantages is that lack of supervision on the international exchange teenagers as they are living in other countries. In general speaking, the youths felt strange and inadaptable at initial period. They can’t speak well foreign language, can’t communicate well with other classmates or teachers, so they might feel alone and isolate from a new circumstance. If they can’t adjust themselves well to fit in with groups as soon as possible, they will encounter more difficult things, such as studying, social and daily routine. The worse situation is that they might give up their studying, even they will mislead them into crime.On the contrary, the advantages are far more than disadvantages. For example, youths will extend their horizons. They will see and know many new things what they never seen in domestic. They would easily accept those new things than adults, because youths have curiosities all long. Furthermore, the teenagers easier to make new friends in other countries, because they are always passion and single-minded. In order to communicate with different background students from all over the world, they must cultivate their social capacities harder than before. It is the best way to elevate their skills of the foreign language is communication. Moreover, through the different viewpoint collisions the international exchange students have gained multiple and scientific logics, which will have a profound impact at the rest their lives. However, I think the simplest advantage is that most the international exchange students have possessed with an excellent foreign language ability after then come back.At the end of my essay, I think it is not suit for all teenagers to be the international exchange students. Here the teenagers must accept some selection processes under the fair and effective principles.;The concept of international student exchange has been gaining popularity in many high schools, especially in big cities. This operation brings numerous advantages that would be highly beneficial for teenage students. In my opinion, the advantages of international student exchange far outweigh the disadvantages, making it a valuable experience for students.One of the primary benefits of international student exchange is the opportunity for students to immerse themselves in a new culture, broadening their perspectives and understanding of the world. By living with a host family and attending a foreign school, students can gain a deeper appreciation for the customs, traditions, and ways of life in another country. This experience can also enhance their language skills, as they are surrounded by native speakers, allowing them to improve their proficiency in a foreign language.Additionally, international student exchange programs provide students with the chance to develop important life skills, such as independence, self-reliance, and adaptability. Living in a foreign country, away from family and friends, requires students to be resourceful and resilient, skills that are essential for success in an increasingly globalized world. Furthermore, international student exchange programs can foster lasting friendships and connections between students from different countries, promoting cross-cultural understanding and cooperation.In contrast, while some may argue that international student exchange programs can be daunting and overwhelming for some students, I believe that the benefits far exceed the drawbacks. With proper support and preparation, students can navigate any challenges that may arise, and the rewards of this experience will undoubtedly have a lasting impact on their personal and academic growth. Overall, I strongly support the idea of international student exchange, and I believe that it is an invaluable opportunity that can enrich the lives of teenage students, preparing them for an interconnected and interdependent world.

From my perspective, such a trend contains much benefits and it is undoubtedly a positive development.On the one hand, people can have more access to their interested expertise and delve into related fields with the help of online courses offered by universities. It is comparatively hard and inconvenient for people to attend courses in the university if they are not college students. Luckily, with myriads of online courses which are usually free and of high quality, learners merely need to register and sign in to find out some interesting courses ranging from academic knowledge to practical skills, which can afford a challenging but exciting experience for those attend the lessons.On the other hand, it is a good way for the universities to improve the quality of the courses as well as make some adaptation to the content of the courses. In order for people outside the universities to acquire knowldege effectively, online courses should cater to people's preference to some extent. It is expectable that some courses which is of great necessity and closely connected with people's daily life would be popular. Thus, universities would therefore release more high-quality courses by innovating teaching skills to meet people's needs.In conlusion, I think online courses provided by universities can surely make a positive impact on society because people who have the desire to acquire knowledge can enjoy sufficient resources without boundaries, which enhances individual's rights to grasp knowledge and facilitates the improvement of higher education in the long run.;The advent of online courses offered by universities has revolutionized the way people acquire knowledge.

531;Write about the following topic.The issue of gay marriage remains controversial. Some people think that this trend has adverse effects on the society while others believe that it is seen as a natural trend and right for people to choose this type of marriage. Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Recently, many countries have legalized gay marriage. However, there are many people who do not agree with that, and claim that it has a bad influence on the education of children, and the evolution of society. However, in my opinion, I think it is a good opportunity for homosexual people as they are now understood by others, and have the right to have children despite of their situation.To begin, there are many parents, for example, who tend to believe that because of the access to gay marriage, their children will find it normal to fall in love with a person from the same sex. As a result, more and more children will become homosexual, which is unconventional as far as the parents are concerned. However, I believe that it is not because children understand the fact that being gay is normal, that they will be influenced by this. In fact, they will be able to compassionate for people who struggle to express their homosexuality, so they will help them to feel more comfortable with that. Moreover, they will be more open-minded which is very important for children development.Secondly, many other people are convinced that gay marriage will inevitably tends towards a decrease of the young population as gay individuals can not have their own kids. As a consequence, This phenomenon represents a threat because young people will not be able to take over for the future. However, I am not of this opinion. I think that such a decrease in young people population will not occur as the vast majority of the world's population in not homosexual. Moreover, by allowing gay marriage, gay couples will be able to adopt children. Indeed, due to the fact that they are not able to give rise to new-born, they can adopt children who are abandonned, and give them the opportunity to live in a new family with good conditions.To conclude, I firmly believe that gay marriage is a good opportunity for the development of the society. Indeed, not only it makes children more open-minded, which is important for their own development, but also gives for those who are unfortunately abandonned, a safe environment to thrive in.;The issue of gay marriage remains a contentious topic in today's society, with some arguing that it has detrimental effects, while others see it as a natural progression of human rights. In my opinion, gay marriage should be legal, as it provides a good opportunity for homosexual individuals to be understood and accepted by others. With the legalization of gay marriage, homosexual couples are now able to adopt children and start families, just like their heterosexual counterparts. This not only promotes equality but also provides a stable and loving environment for children to grow up in.Some parents may worry that the accessibility of gay marriage will influence their children to fall in love with someone of the same sex. However, I believe that this is a misconception. Children's understanding and acceptance of gay relationships as normal does not necessarily mean that they will be influenced to become gay themselves. Rather, it promotes a culture of acceptance, tolerance, and empathy, which are essential values for any individual to possess. It is crucial for children to understand that being gay is a natural part of human diversity, and that everyone has the right to love and be loved, regardless of their sexual orientation.By legalizing gay marriage, we are taking a significant step towards creating a more inclusive and compassionate society. It is not about promoting a particular lifestyle, but about recognizing the fundamental human rights of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. As a society, we should strive to promote understanding, acceptance, and love, and gay marriage is an important step in this direction. Ultimately, the legalization of gay marriage is a matter of equality, justice, and human rights, and it is our responsibility to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, are treated with dignity and respect.
293;Write about the following topic.The most important function of music is that it helps people reduce stress. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many today have come to the conclusion that the most significant effect on people of music is to relieve stress. While I agree that music also has more important positive functions other than reducing stress.On the one hand, I have to admit that music is a good way to reduce stress and it do plays an important role in our daily life. A good example of this can be seen in Shanghai, where has a large number of single karaoke rooms in the office buildings. As we all know, compared to the others cities in China, the people living in Shanghai face more stress, like the surprisingly high price of house and the fierce competition of work. Those public karaoke rooms, which were provided by the government for the public, become a good place for people to enjoy the music and have fun.On the other hand, for many people, music is an ideal career to persue in their life, like the job as an accountant, which can bring them with incomes and improve their living standard. For example, the TV programs related to music attract more and more people to participate in, like The Voice. Most of the participants wish to show their excellent peformance in music through these stages with the purpose of having access to more business opportunities and making more money at the same time. It is undeniable that the following income would be exponential increased than before if they succeed finally.In conclusion, it is not doubt that music is very essential for us, not only for its spiritual meanings, but also for its more important role in our society which could allow the person to relise their dream while creating more economical benefits.;"The notion that the most important function of music is to help people reduce stress has gained significant traction in recent times. Many today have come to the conclusion that the most significant effect on people of music is to relieve stress. While I agree that music does have a profound impact on stress levels, the argument that this is its most important function is one I only partially agree with. In my view, music also has more important positive functions other than reducing stress.For instance, music has the power to bring people together, to inspire creativity, and to provide a platform for self-expression. The impact of music on social cohesion and community building is often overlooked but is undoubtedly significant. For example, the TV programs related to music, such as ""The Voice,"" attract more and more people to participate, not just as contestants but also as enthusiastic viewers. These shows create a shared experience, fostering a sense of community and shared passion among the audience. They also provide a stage for undiscovered talent to emerge, highlighting the role of music in empowering individuals and promoting diversity.Furthermore, music is a universal language that transcends cultural and linguistic barriers, allowing it to be a powerful tool for education, social change, and emotional healing beyond just stress relief. It can evoke emotions, create lasting memories, and influence societal attitudes and norms. The role of music in therapy for mental health conditions, besides stress, is another area where its benefits are being explored and utilized.In conclusion, while the stress-relieving properties of music are undeniable and highly beneficial, to categorize this as its most important function may underestimate the breadth of its impact. Music's ability to unite, to inspire, and to educate positions it as a multifaceted tool that contributes to human well-being and society in a myriad of ways beyond stress alleviation."

Finding solutions to reduce traffic is very crucial. I totally agree that if people travel less from home to work or to education or even for shopping can reduce the amount of traffic. With the covid 19 outbreak pandemic we saw how much the working from home and using the zoom application for studying reduced the traffic in cities. People now are using online for shopping too. We know that traffic can be reduced if less consumers are using the roads. However, I dont agree that this is the only way to reduce traffic. Other strategies to reduce traffic are :1. Planning the roads and building the road bridges in a smarter way with special lanes for public transportation.2. Encourging people to use light trails, public transportations and to use car pools.3. Building special lanes for motorcycles and electric bikes.4. The governoment can put more regulations regarding how many cars each family can have.5. Increasing the vehicles prices and reduce the public transportation tickets.6. Educate people on the consequences of traffic and how it can inadverntly affect their life.7. Encourge people to walk more and to choose a work that is close to your home.As I mentioned above there are many strategies that can help in reducing tranffic and only by reducing the need for people to travel from home. I think i people travel less it abviously can reduce the traffic but we need a multi strategy with the collaberations of many sectors to successfly reduce traffic in cities.;The issue of traffic congestion in cities has become a pressing concern, requiring immediate attention. Traffic in cities is now a major public health problem, contributing to air pollution, noise pollution, and increased risk of accidents. Finding solutions to reduce traffic is very crucial, as it not only affects the environment but also the quality of life of urban residents. In my opinion, I totally agree that reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education, or shopping is an effective way to decrease traffic congestion in cities.If people travel less from home to work or to education, it can significantly reduce the amount of traffic on the roads. For instance, companies can adopt flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or compressed workweeks, which allow employees to work from home and reduce their commute time. Similarly, online education platforms can provide students with the opportunity to access educational resources from the comfort of their own homes, minimizing the need to travel to schools or universities. Furthermore, online shopping has become increasingly popular, enabling people to purchase goods and services without having to physically visit stores.By reducing the need for people to travel, cities can experience a significant decrease in traffic congestion, resulting in lower emissions, reduced noise pollution, and improved air quality. This, in turn, can lead to a healthier and more sustainable urban environment. In conclusion, reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education, or shopping is a practical and effective solution to alleviate traffic congestion in cities. It is essential for governments, organizations, and individuals to work together to implement strategies that promote reduced travel and create a more sustainable and livable urban environment.
235;Write about the following topic.There are several factors that motivate people to stay in the workforce, and money is the most important reason/factor. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The topic of motivation for work has merely failed to be discussed. Someone elaborate that the most significant factor is money while others suppose it is not. As far as I am concerned, although money is of great importance, it cannot always be the most valuable one.Undoubtedly, money can be a crucial factor to diminish the financial burden of families, especially for those who were born in a poverty-stricken area. To be more specific, only by earning sufficient money can they raise their later generations and keep the elderly. Provided that they cannot find a decent job that allow them to own some disposable money, it would add insult to injury.However, there are a great number of factors that may be considered as worthwhile to be the motivation of stay in the staff by some people. First of all, being in the workforce can help to strengthen an individual’s interpersonal skills. It is widely acknowledged that there are a colossal number of activities as well as team programmes that require people to collaborate, compromise and compete with the others. Thus, individuals will tend to learn some social skills and become gregarious and sociable, which can help them better adapt themselves to the mainstream society. In addition, people may also get a chance to broaden their horizons and lay a firm basis for future development by staying in the workforce. For instance, under the circumstance that numerous companies may provide the staff with the opportunity to go abroad and get involved in some international programs, people are able to get access to different cultures. As a result, people can develop panning-for-gold thinking rather than sponge-feeding thinking in the process of understanding divergent cultures, which can be beneficial for their future careers.In conclusion, although money is valuable for individuals to be in the workforce, there are many other factors that cannot be overlooked. Only by treating all the factors rationally can we enjoy the pleasure rather than pressure.;The idea that money is the most important factor motivating people to stay in the workforce is a notion that has been widely debated. While I agree that financial compensation is a significant motivator, I also believe that it is not the only reason, and perhaps not even the most important one for many individuals. Money can indeed be a crucial factor in diminishing the financial burden of families, allowing them to afford basic necessities and enjoy a certain standard of living. However, it is not the sole driving force behind people's decision to remain in the workforce.There are a multitude of factors that can be considered equally, if not more, worthwhile motivations for staying in the staff. For instance, being in the workforce provides individuals with the opportunity to strengthen their interpersonal skills, such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. These skills are not only valuable in a professional setting but also in personal relationships and community engagements. Furthermore, being part of a workforce can offer people a chance to broaden their horizons, exposing them to new ideas, cultures, and experiences that enrich their personal and professional growth.Examples from my own knowledge and experience illustrate this point. Many professionals, especially in fields like education, healthcare, and social work, are motivated by a sense of purpose and the desire to make a positive impact on society, rather than just financial gain. Additionally, the opportunity for continuous learning and professional development can be a significant motivator, as it allows individuals to stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in their field, thereby enhancing their career satisfaction and growth. In conclusion, while money is an important factor, it is by no means the only, or for many, the most important reason for staying in the workforce. A variety of other factors, including personal growth, social interaction, and the pursuit of meaningful work, play significant roles in motivating individuals to remain engaged and active in their professions.
115;Write about the following topic.To meet the growing need for food to support an increasing population, a country should make use of edible insects as a food source. However, some people believe that insects are not only unhealthy but harvesting them will also negatively affect nature. What are the benefits and drawbacks of eating insects?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some countries and culture already utilize insects as part of food source. As such, it can be relatively inexpensive to consume insects - which are often freely found in certain environments and do not take much skill to be collected, killed and consumed - as compared to the cost and manual labor involved in raising animal livestock, butchering, as well as preparing the meat for consumption. Similarly agriculture also involves consistent manual labor, and has costs associated with it, including for machinery and materials needed. However, people may be against the idea of consuming insects due to the novelty of it, and they may also feel disgust around it. As the prompt states, some may find it unhealthy. Harvesting insects on purpose will also require some physical and psychological work - but the benefit here is that it may be easier than harvesting large animals or cultivating crops.I have never consumed an insect product - and my father has mentioned to me that had lived in such-and-such country, I would not be so scared of cockroaches - viewing them as a food source. He intended this to be an ironic comment, meant to comfor me somewhat due to my strong aversion to cockroaches. However, he may be correct! For individuals socialized in such a society, their aversion to roaches may be lower than mine. Hence, part of the issue here is socialization and accepting this new food norm, should it be novel to the individual and/or the country.I have tried an octopus for the first time when I was around 20 years old - as I was curious about this dish called Takoyaki, and had heard good reviews of it. It was not unpleasant to eat the ocotpus, per se, but I likely will not go back to it. All in all, new experiences, including consumption of new types of food, may create strong aversion at first, but once dip your toes into it, so to speak, it may be tamer than the experience you were expecting - even if you never go back to eating it again.;The notion of incorporating edible insects as a food source to meet the growing demand for sustenance has sparked a heated debate. On one hand, entomophagy, the practice of eating insects, offers numerous benefits, including high protein content, low environmental impact, and a potential solution to global food insecurity. However, many people are against this idea due to the novelty of it, which often evokes feelings of disgust and unease. The unfamiliarity of consuming insects can be attributed to socialization, as many individuals and countries are not accustomed to this practice.Some argue that insects are unhealthy to consume, which further perpetuates the negative perception. Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that many insects are rich in micronutrients and can be a valuable addition to a balanced diet. The key issue lies in accepting this new food norm, which requires a significant shift in societal attitudes. In countries where entomophagy is already prevalent, such as Thailand and Mexico, insects are considered a delicacy and are consumed without hesitation. This highlights the importance of socialization and cultural norms in shaping our perceptions of what is deemed acceptable to eat.Ultimately, the benefits of eating insects, including their potential to address food shortages and environmental concerns, outweigh the drawbacks. It is crucial to educate people about the nutritional value and safety of consuming insects, as well as to promote cultural exchange and understanding of entomophagy practices in other countries. By doing so, we can work towards breaking down the social and cultural barriers that currently hinder the adoption of insects as a viable food source, and pave the way for a more sustainable and food-secure future.

So they could contributed more for any pension plan or those kind of program. We need to guarantee that our next governants will be capable to redesign the retire's program in an way to guarantee those beneffits to whole population.Looking by a health care perspective, all the improvments and medicine advance, it brings the possibilite to have a good life even allthough the years.For instance, we can see many people that healed from a bad ill like cancer or other ones and have a good life nowadays.This is the reason that elderly people is not a problem to our society, but in fact their represents more knowledge and we have all tecnology to take care about theirselfs.In other way we can see that our society open more space and are more concern with elderly population. We can see some places speciallyzed to take care of their and also a kind of intertainement focused on them, like some hotels, restauurants, clinics.In whole way our society are looking for treaty our elderly society in a decent way, respect them, make a enviroment friendly for their deficient and any dificult of mobility and any other issue that we need to cope to guarantee their activities.;The advancements in today's healthcare have led to a significant increase in the elderly population. As medical technology and treatments continue to improve, it is inevitable that people are living longer. I believe that all improvements in healthcare increase the number of elderly people, but those improvements also bring benefits in a way to care for them. From a healthcare perspective, all the improvements and medical advances bring the possibility to have a good life, even in old age.The increase in the elderly population can be managed with proper planning and resource allocation. For instance, many countries are implementing aged-care programs, which provide support and services to the elderly, enabling them to live independently and maintain their quality of life. Additionally, the development of elderly-friendly infrastructure, such as retirement villages and nursing homes, can help to cater to the growing needs of the elderly population.Moreover, the improvements in healthcare also bring benefits in terms of the elderly population's ability to contribute to society. With many elderly individuals remaining healthy and active, they can continue to work, volunteer, and participate in their communities, bringing valuable experience and wisdom. This not only benefits the individual but also the society as a whole. For example, many retired professionals are now working as mentors, coaches, or consultants, sharing their knowledge and expertise with the younger generation.In conclusion, while the increase in the elderly population may pose challenges, I believe that society will be able to cope with the increase in numbers of elderly people today. The improvements in healthcare, which have led to the increase in the elderly population, also bring benefits in terms of the ability to care for them and the contributions they can make to society. With proper planning, resource allocation, and support, the elderly population can continue to live healthy, active, and fulfilling lives, and society can reap the benefits of their experience and wisdom.
933;Write about the following topic.Young people in the modern world seem to have more power and influence than any previous young generation.Why is this the case?What impact does this have on the relationship between old and young people?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"In modern times, the younger generation appear to be more powerful and influencial compared to the generations in times past. I believe this is as a result of younger people being more ascertive, stepping up to question and change existing societal norms and archaic cultures. At first, this may negatively affect their relationship with the older generation as a result of how unfamiliar they are to these changes but subsequently, the tension is bound to resolve, when the older generations come to accept these changes.To begin with, it is an open truth that young people these days tend to be very bold and outspoken and unlike their predecessors, are better at questioning norms that do not sit right with them and even going an extra mile to change these norms or cultures. A good example of this is seen in women empowerment and rights activism. In my part of the world, some years back, it was believed that a woman's place is in the kitchen and her sole job was to birth and rear children, therefore, women were not allowed to be educated or have paying jobs. Women in the older generation complied to this because it was the norm, but this is not the case in modern times, because many young women opposed to it and now, homes are even headed by women; the power of activism.Many people in the older generation are not familiar with young people being more outspoken and this is understandable because in their time, they were taught to only follow rules and not to question them. Therefore the fact that young people have become more outspoken and powerful is foreign to them and just like every human nature, whatever is foreign or different is automatically hated. As a result, there is likely going to be a tension between the 2 generations, however, with constant advocation and learning the tension is bound to resolve. For example, going back to women's rights activism, at the start, many older people were not on board as they did not think it was normal, however, there are now a lot of older people who have become activists.In conclusion, I believe that the power and influence the younger generation has is as a result of their ascertiveness and will to effect changes in their societies and even though it may cause a negative relationship with the older generation at first, subsequently, their differences is likely to be ironed out when the older generation learns to accept these changes.";The modern world has witnessed a significant shift in the dynamics of power and influence, with young people holding more sway than any previous generation. This phenomenon can be attributed to the growing assertiveness of younger individuals, who are increasingly stepping up to question and challenge existing societal norms and archaic cultures. In modern times, the younger generation appears to be more powerful and influential compared to the generations of times past.I believe this is a result of younger people being more assertive, stepping up to question and change existing societal norms and archaic cultures. This newfound confidence and willingness to challenge the status quo has enabled them to bring about significant changes in various aspects of society, from politics and social justice to technology and entertainment. For instance, the likes of Greta Thunberg and Malala Yousafzai have become global icons, inspiring millions of young people to take action on issues such as climate change and education.At first, this may negatively affect their relationship with the older generation, as they are unfamiliar with these changes. The older generation may view the younger generation's assertiveness as disrespect or a lack of tradition, leading to tension and conflict. However, with constant advocacy and learning, the tension is bound to resolve. As the older generation becomes more aware of the reasons behind the younger generation's actions, they begin to understand and appreciate their perspective. This, in turn, fosters a more harmonious and respectful relationship between the two generations, with each learning from and influencing the other. Ultimately, the increased power and influence of young people in the modern world have the potential to bring about positive change and create a more equitable and just society.
351;Write about the following topic:In many countries, not enough students study science subjects. What are the causes? What will be the effect on society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, there are many courses available to take, from arts that include theatre and music to scientific topics such as mathemathics, physics, chemistry, biology and medicine. There is an evidence that the amount of students willing to learn science subjects is not sufficient. In this essay I will discuss the causes of the issue and the possible effect on society.There are several casues for the fact that students tend to skip science subjects. First, studying science can be hard and exhausting. The complexity of some subjects such as math and physics requires from the student to study many hours at home. Secondly, there are students who do not only find those courses difficult, but also get low marks even after studying long hours. As for chemistry classes, some courses include labratory lessons which may not appeal to some students.The importance of people having knowledge in science is great. The society relies on science on a daily basis. For instance, doctors who study medicine, must know mathematics, biology and chemistry well, because biology is relevant to the patient's body. In addition, doctors prescribe medications so they must know chemistry well. Another example is architects whose job is to plan and design buildings. Without a proper knowledge in physics, they could not plan buildings.Discussing those facts, studying science can be challenging. However, it is vital for the society that students will study science. Without doctors, nurses, scientists and other professions that rely on science, the health of the society might be effected negatively.;The dearth of students pursuing science subjects has become a pressing concern in many countries. Evidence suggests that the number of students willing to learn science subjects is alarmingly low. This trend can be attributed to several underlying causes. Firstly, studying science can be a daunting and exhausting task, requiring a significant amount of time and effort to grasp complex concepts and theories. Many students find the rigors of science courses overwhelming, leading them to opt for less demanding subjects.Secondly, some students find science subjects particularly challenging, and despite dedicating long hours to studying, they still manage to secure low marks. This can be discouraging, as students may feel that their efforts are not yielding the desired results, causing them to lose motivation and interest in pursuing science-related fields. Furthermore, this perceived difficulty can lead to a vicious cycle, where students' lack of confidence in their ability to excel in science subjects deters them from enrolling in these courses.The effects of this phenomenon on society will be far-reaching and profound. A scarcity of skilled science professionals can hinder a country's progress in fields such as technology, medicine, and environmental conservation. This, in turn, can lead to a decline in innovation, economic growth, and overall quality of life. For instance, a shortage of medical professionals can lead to inadequate healthcare services, while a lack of skilled engineers can impede the development of critical infrastructure. It is imperative that educators and policymakers address these issues, making science subjects more accessible and appealing to a broader range of students. By doing so, we can ensure a steady supply of skilled science professionals, who will drive progress and improve the lives of future generations.
1185;Write about the following topic:Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Poverty has been always a major issue around the world. Due to viruses, natural disasters, and poor management in the country and overpopulation, each day the poverty increases. In addition, some developed countries ignore the help or just give a temporary solution. Poverty has a great effect on the income that can lead to serious problems.To begin with, developed countries shouldn't only support with financial aid, as that kind of solution will not help the people. In my opinion, rich countries can stop poverty in such way to look for the natural resources of the poor country and to help and develop its resources. For example, in Africa they are famous for their large area of land. A rich country can take this opportunity to implement a long-term plan to benefit and fight poverty, such as to start expanding the lands of agriculture to use their natural resources such as cocoa, rice, and coffee. Furthermore, this idea can also help the people of the country where they can work on the land and be employed.Also, developed countries can donate and build health care centers and schools to prevent the dangerous disease from spreading. Schools can empower children to grow up and help the country's economy to rise and to fight poverty.In conclusion, developed countries can unite and discuss this significant concern rather than helping with financial support as poverty is taking the lives of many children. Poor countries just need better solutions and understanding from the world to prevent such problems from continuing to happen.;Poverty has been a perpetual and pressing issue around the world, posing significant challenges to global development and stability. The prevalence of poverty is exacerbated by factors such as viruses, natural disasters, and poor management within countries, leading to a steady increase in poverty levels each day. The role of rich countries in alleviating poverty in poorer nations is a subject of ongoing debate, with some arguing that financial aid is insufficient to address the root causes of poverty.In my opinion, I agree that rich countries should reconsider their approach to helping poorer countries, shifting their focus from merely providing financial aid to offering other forms of assistance. One effective strategy could involve rich countries collaborating with poorer nations to identify, develop, and manage their natural resources. Many poor countries are rich in natural resources but lack the expertise, technology, or infrastructure to harness these resources effectively. By providing technical assistance, investing in infrastructure, and sharing knowledge on sustainable resource management, rich countries can help poor nations to unlock their economic potential.For instance, a country rich in mineral deposits or fertile land could be assisted by a developed country in setting up efficient mining or agricultural practices, respectively. This not only generates income and creates jobs but also ensures that the resources are managed sustainably for long-term benefits. Furthermore, such collaborations can lead to transfers of technology and skills, enhancing the poor country's capacity for self-sufficiency and growth.In conclusion, while financial aid may provide temporary relief, it is the empowerment of poor countries through resource development, technology transfer, and capacity building that holds the key to sustainable poverty reduction. Rich countries have the opportunity to make a lasting impact by adopting a more holistic and collaborative approach to assisting poorer nations, one that addresses the underlying causes of poverty and fosters self-sustaining economic growth.
343;Write about the following topic:Some people believe that it is important to spend a lot of money on family celebrations. While others think it is a waste of money. Discuss both views.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Spending money in family celebrations can be seen as a way of appreciating where one comes from. Although some people say it is a total waste of money, l assert that it is wiser.To begin with, many people feel that it is of no importance to consume money on family gatherings. This is because people usually have more pressing issues in life like urgent health cases that require money. Also, some struggle to provide basic needs for their families, for example, tuitions, decent meals and shelter. For these reasons, it seems using money on family gatherings is just a luxury.Despite the merits of the arguments above, although many say it is wasteful to financially cater for family parties, l assert that it is crucial. One reason is that, it unites families and a sweet spirit is maintained if family members are recognised for their special days such as wedding anniversaries, birthdays and graduations where money is spent. Further, appreciation to others within the family cannot be expressed in many ways without forking out some money.Furthermore, money has to be spent on family get togethers where everyone is in a joyous mood so that people can catch up and release stresses from their straining personal lives. What is more, culture, closeness and love is easily displayed when families come together for such celebrations and use money for their own satisfaction. For instance, when my childhood birthdays were celebrated, l felt so much loved and l still cherish the memories as l vividly can recall.To conclude, although others feel that it is money consuming to fund family gatherings, l advocate that it is a wiser option. Should this be the case, love within families would not wax cold and family members would feel more appreciated.;The debate about whether spending a significant amount of money on family celebrations is necessary has sparked intense discussion. While some individuals argue that it is a waste of resources, others believe that it is essential to appreciate one's heritage and strengthen family bonds. In my opinion, I assert that spending money on family celebrations is wiser, as it unites families and fosters a sense of appreciation among members.Spending money on family celebrations can be seen as a way of appreciating where one comes from, showcasing gratitude for the family's love and support. For instance, birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries are special occasions that bring family members together, creating lasting memories. By allocating a substantial budget to these events, it demonstrates the value placed on these moments and the people involved. Moreover, it allows family members to feel recognised and appreciated on their special days, which boosts their morale and strengthens the family's bond.On the other hand, some people claim that splurging on family celebrations is a total waste of money. They argue that the funds could be better utilised on essential needs such as education, health, or savings. However, while these concerns are valid, I believe that the benefits of spending on family celebrations far outweigh the costs. A sweet spirit is maintained when family members feel valued, and this, in turn, promotes a sense of unity and togetherness. In conclusion, although opinions may vary, I firmly believe that investing in family celebrations is a wise decision, as it cultivates a sense of belonging, appreciation, and unity among family members.
397;Write about the following topic:Some people think that hosting an international sports event is good for the country, while some people think it is bad. Discuss both views and state your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;International sports events are one of the most trendy interactions at any hosting country. Depending on the hoster, the events could represent a virtue or a slip. This dependence is associated with the costs, logisitcs, marketing, etc. I tend to be of the opinion, that the virtues outweigh the disadvantages and that they shall be considered as opportunities to exploit.Some people think of the international sport events as being disadvantageous, because for example of being a pressure on the countries' infrastructure as well as the provided services and facilities. Another reason might emerge as some countries also might not be well-suited for such events. For instance, despite spending a big budget on the organisation of the event, the lack of qualified personnel or needed objects and materials shall cause a massive distruction of the hostees' experiences.The other perpective of the usages and utilization of such events could be clear through the massive amount of virtues, which these events normally brings to the hosting countries. For example, these events are regularly sponsored from international organisation, which provide the financial means not for only the logisitcs of the events, but additionally fees for the hosters. Furthermore, the financial benefits shall not stop by the provided fees through the owning organisation, but also the global or regional branding of such country will affect the tourism and the local service providers absolutely positive.Concluding, international sport events could be absolutely virtous, if the hosting countries were to implement their strategies successfully. Should such countries be willing to give the event the raw focus on the organisation and the user-experience, that would absolutely lead to massive benefits financially, marketing-wise and from intercultural perspective.;The hosting of international sports events has sparked a heated debate among individuals, with some believing it to be beneficial for the country, while others perceive it as detrimental. In my opinion, the virtues of hosting such events outweigh the disadvantages. International sports events are one of the most trendy interactions in any hosting country, and their impact largely depends on the host. On the one hand, hosting international sports events can be a slip, particularly if the host country is not adequately prepared. The enormous costs associated with organizing and hosting these events can put a significant strain on the country's economy. Furthermore, the influx of tourists and athletes can lead to logistical challenges, such as overcrowding and strain on public services. For instance, the 2014 World Cup in Brazil was marred by protests and criticism over the exorbitant costs and poor infrastructure.On the other hand, I tend to be of the opinion that the virtues outweigh the disadvantages. Hosting international sports events can be a virtue, as it presents a unique opportunity for the host country to showcase its culture, promote tourism, and foster national pride. The events can also lead to significant investments in infrastructure, such as stadiums, transportation systems, and accommodation facilities, which can have a lasting impact on the country's development. For example, the 2012 London Olympics led to a significant regeneration of East London and boosted the UK's international reputation. Additionally, the events can promote social cohesion and unity among citizens, as people come together to support their national teams.In conclusion, while hosting international sports events can have its drawbacks, I firmly believe that the benefits far outweigh the costs. With careful planning and management, these events can be a catalyst for economic growth, cultural exchange, and national unity. As such, I think that hosting international sports events can be a valuable opportunity for any country, and the virtues associated with these events make them an attractive proposition.
1412;You can get up-to-date news from the radio, TV and the Internet. Which kind of media do you think is the best to get the news?;Nowadays, there are several channels to get news, such as the radio, TV, newspapers and the Internet. I think the Internet is the best among these. .Since its invention, the Internet has been booming as a prospective industry. Not only because it is a combination of text, audio and video, but also due to its . It has threatened the domination of spreading news of the traditional media, and, I would say, is about to take control.We can find everything we want on the Internet – the latest news, books, songs, movies, cartoons… . With the radio, we can merely hear. Compared to a newspaper, the radio and TV can provide the latest information. For instance the breaking news of the Americans’ attacking Iraq was immediately online, as well as that the Twin Towers of New York were destroyed on September 11, 2001. However, we just cannot .The Internet is a way of getting information, as long as your mobile phone is connected or you possess a laptop. When I am a vehicle, I usually have my cellphone connected to the Internet, then browse through what in the past few hours, or log in MSN to begin a conversation with my friends. Reading a newspaper is also a good way to kill time, but for me, a youngster, it is not so modern as “surfing online while commuting”.The traditional media will never disappear, though the Internet has taken a big advantage the competition. And definitely, there is still a long way for the Internet to go. , the Internet benefits me the most, and I highly appreciate it.;The way we consume news has undergone a significant transformation in recent years. With the advent of technology, we now have multiple sources to stay updated on current events, including the radio, TV, and the Internet. Among these options, I firmly believe that the Internet is the best medium to get the news.The Internet has threatened the domination of traditional media, such as radio and TV, in spreading news, and I would say, is about to take control.

This diversity enables users to form a more comprehensive understanding of current events, rather than relying on a single source.Furthermore, the Internet also facilitates real-time updates, allowing users to stay abreast of breaking news as it happens. With the rise of online news platforms and social media, news can now spread rapidly, often reaching a global audience in a matter of minutes. In conclusion, the Internet has revolutionized the way we consume news, offering unparalleled convenience, accessibility, and diversity. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that the Internet will become the primary source of news for an increasingly large proportion of the population.
1377;should children grow up in the city or countryside (advantages/disadvantages)?;Some people think it is better for children to grown up in the city, while others think that life in the countryside is more suitable for them. What are the advantages and disadvantages of both places?Living in the rural area is the best option for children by a group of people, while others believe that cities offer more opportunities. In my opinion, if the city offers security and green areas, I agree it is a better place to raise the next generation some advantages both sides.Firstly, the countryside in touch with nature, taking care of animals and helping with the gardening. Because of that, they learn how to protect the environment and to live without any technological equipment. Besides that, they have more freedom to play outside the house without any security worries, whereas in the city they are kept at home smartphones and computers for this reason. On the other hand, schools usually have lower quality and it is hard to find extracurricular classes. Therefore, children difficulties trying to develop their abilities besides the school curriculum.However, schools at metropolitan areas tend to have better quality and offer all kinds of activities. Even if there is a sport or an art course that the institution does not offer, it is possible to look for it in another place around the city. As a result, all children’s talents and passions can be easier to develop. On the other hand, security, pollution and contact with nature are issues that we have to worry about. The better option would be a city with an excellent quality of life where children could play in parks and gardens.To sum up, growing up in the countryside can be very positive for someone’s childhood, but the city will usually offer better opportunities for their talents’ development.This is a well written essay. It talks about all parts of the task and the arguments and ideas are extended and supported by some examples. The information is sequenced in a logical way and most of the ideas are linked using appropriate connective words. The choice of vocabulary is suitable to express the meaning of the writer, though in some instances word choice can be improved further (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows suggested corrections). Most sentences are error-free and demonstrate various levels of complexity. Overall this essay seems good enough to deserve IELTS Band 8.;The debate about whether children should grow up in the city or countryside has been ongoing for years. Some people think it is better for children to grow up in the city, while others believe that life in the countryside is more suitable for them. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages.On the one hand, growing up in the countryside has numerous benefits for children. They get to be in touch with nature, learn about taking care of animals, and help with gardening, which teaches them valuable life skills and responsibility. Moreover, they have more freedom to play outside the house without any security worries, allowing them to explore and develop their imagination. This kind of upbringing can foster a sense of independence and a deeper connection with the natural world.On the other hand, there are some significant drawbacks to consider. Schools in rural areas usually have lower quality facilities and resources, which can impact the quality of education. Additionally, it is hard to find extracurricular classes or activities, limiting children's opportunities to develop their interests and talents. This can put them at a disadvantage compared to their urban counterparts, who often have access to a wider range of educational and recreational resources.In contrast, city life offers a different set of experiences and opportunities. While it may lack the natural beauty and freedom of the countryside, urban areas provide access to better educational facilities, a variety of extracurricular activities, and exposure to diverse cultures and lifestyles. However, the fast-paced and often crowded environment of cities can also have its downsides, such as increased security concerns and less space for outdoor play.Ultimately, the decision of whether children should grow up in the city or countryside depends on what parents value most for their child's development and well-being. Both environments have their unique advantages and disadvantages, and what suits one family may not suit another.
917;‘Failure is proof that the desire wasn’t strong enough’To what extent do you agree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Failure is what nobody wish for, but it could occur secondarily to an unsuccessful attempt towards ones goal, for various reasons. I am in the view that, failure is not a proof of lack of desire, rather it is more to do with improper techniques, less allocation of time and lack of proper attitude.It is the general view that, ultimate success in any field is taught through the failures in life. One can be subjected to multiple failures due to lack of ability to develop essential skill set, also known as techniques, that would be essential to achieve a certain goal. One classic example is Thomas Alwa Eddison, the great inventor of all time, who went through nearly 100 unsucessfull experiments, before inventing the light bulb. He was brave enough to accept the failure experiments had taught him 100 different impossible ways not to discover the light bulb.On the other hand, time plays one of the most crucial factors in obtaining a goal/success. By this I meant, the time that is allocated towards full filling tasks that are directed towards preparing for the goal. The little time is spent during the preparation, the further away the goal felt like. For an instance, one cannot expected to win a marothon with just one day preparation.Similarly, attitude plays by far the most striking part of the success. This is simple as, one cannot dream of becoming a good physician, having shown no interest in paying attention to people and their health related complaints.In a nut shell, failure is not a proof for inadequate desire in fact, failure is due to improper practices of techniques,failure of managing time in preparing and attitudes that fires the drive.;"The statement ""Failure is proof that the desire wasn't strong enough"" is a debatable notion that has sparked intense discussion. While some may agree with this assertion, I strongly disagree. In my opinion, failure is not a definitive indicator of a lack of desire, but rather a reflection of other factors such as improper techniques, inadequate time allocation, and a lack of proper attitude.Desire is a crucial driving force behind achieving success, but it is not the sole determinant. Many individuals with strong desires may still experience failure due to other limitations. For instance, a person may have a strong desire to learn a new language, but lack the necessary techniques, such as effective learning strategies or sufficient practice, to achieve proficiency. Similarly, an individual may have a strong desire to succeed in a particular sport, but lack the necessary skills or physical ability to excel.Moreover, failure can often be attributed to a lack of essential skill sets. A person may have a strong desire to become a successful entrepreneur, but lack the necessary skills in areas such as marketing, finance, or leadership. In such cases, failure is not a reflection of the individual's desire, but rather their inability to develop the necessary skills to achieve success. Thomas Edison's famous quote ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work"" is a testament to the fact that failure is an essential part of the learning process, and that it is not necessarily a reflection of a lack of desire.In conclusion, while desire is an essential component of achieving success, it is not the only factor. Failure is more often a result of improper techniques, inadequate time allocation, lack of proper attitude, and a lack of essential skill sets. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the statement that ""Failure is proof that the desire wasn't strong enough"". Instead, failure should be viewed as an opportunity to learn and improve, and to develop the necessary skills and strategies to achieve success."
1419;“Some people say that the education system is the only critical factor to development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?”;Education plays a vital role in the development of a country. Therefore, some people think that the education system is the only important factor to the development of a country and they may be right.Education is the foundation of developed society. It is rightly said, ‘education is a ladder success’. If all the people of any country are educated then they becomes broadminded, civilized and progressive. An educated society improves the standard of life as well., education also creates a good employment opportunity and therefore country does not have to suffer from big problems like unemployment. Educated peoples are more aware of such as pollution and many more. A country becomes technologically advanced because of educated people.Not only this, but also by giving importance to education, the nations can get rid of problems like , poverty, unemployment and population growth that delay the progress of a nation. The crime rate can also be kept under . The standard of living of the people will go up. If the nations to be progressive it is very important that the people are more educated and progressive. Any country can become more technologically advanced and developed because of education.However, there are other factors that also play an important role in the development of a country. Such as governments have to encouraged people to do soIn conclusion, I would like to say that a good education system will lead to a developed country.;The statement that the education system is the only critical factor to the development of a country is a notion that has sparked intense debate. While I agree that education plays a vital role in the development of a country, I disagree that it is the only critical factor. Education is indeed a cornerstone of a nation's progress, and it is rightly said that 'education is a ladder to success'. It equips individuals with the knowledge, skills, and competencies necessary to contribute to the economic, social, and political development of their country.Education also creates a plethora of good employment opportunities, thereby mitigating the scourge of unemployment that plagues many developing nations. When a country has a well-educated workforce, it is better positioned to attract investment, innovate, and compete in the global economy. Furthermore, education fosters critical thinking,, analysis, and problem-solving skills, which are essential for tackling complex development challenges such as poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation.However, to suggest that education is the only critical factor is an oversimplification. Other factors such as economic policies, infrastructure development, healthcare, and governance also play crucial roles in a country's development. A country may have a highly educated population, but if it lacks adequate infrastructure, institutional frameworks, or economic opportunities, its development will be hindered. In conclusion, while education is a vital component of a country's development, it is not the only critical factor. A more nuanced approach that considers the interplay of multiple factors is necessary for holistic development. Therefore, I only partially agree with the statement, recognizing the significance of education while also acknowledging the importance of other development determinants.
