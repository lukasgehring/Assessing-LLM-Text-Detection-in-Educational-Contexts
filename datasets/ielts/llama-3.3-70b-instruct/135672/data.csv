1095;A country becomes more interesting and develops more quickly when its population includes a mixture of nationalities.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is belived that countries are developing faster and become more inspiring when their populations consist of variety of people with different nationalities. In my opinion, it is very controversial question, but I believe that nations who are tolerant to others and friendly are able to succeed in constracting better world not only for themselves and their surroundings but also for future generations. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view about attractiveness and development of countries based on national diversity.On the one hand, people of different nationalities are hardly able to understand each other and can be impatient for people who have another nationalities, that can create difficulties in communication, making agreements, sovling of problems. For example, people with different backgrounds can strat arguing about better governmental constitutions and politics, religions, educational system, traditional and another types of medicine, and so on. It worths to mention that none of those people will be completely right, if they deside to show off their experience instead of accepting ideas of others and just giving advice. Moreover, some disputes can even lead to quarrels, but not to finding the better dessisions, that can influence on safety of people with different nationalities. So, for living peacefully and sharing some ideas of better developmental practice, people should first of all respect each other independantly of their nantionalities.On the other hand, people of various nationalities are able to create not only interesting and diverse community, but also share knowlege and experience in order to achieve the best results in countries' development. For achieving this, people should follow several basic rules, which are usually unwritten, but those mental and behavioral lows should be understood by everyone. Firstly, they should be tolerant to each other and accepting some differences. Secondly, they should be polite when they want to share their knowlege and experiences, not showing off. Thirdly, it would be wonderful if they are able to create international community where people can communicate and make friends. Last but not least, they should remember that their attitudes for each other influence on the world as a whole where they and their children live, so they should be responsible for their words and behavior.In conclusion, countries which managed to connect people of different nationalities and create a friendly surroundings, in my opinion, are able to develope faster and look like fascinating diverse community which consist of people of various backgrounds.;The notion that a country becomes more interesting and develops more quickly with a mixture of nationalities is a widely debated topic. In my opinion, I agree to a large extent that a diverse population can contribute to a country's growth and fascination.On the one hand, a multicultural society brings together different perspectives, ideas, and experiences, which can lead to innovation and progress. For instance, the United States is a prime example of a country that has thrived on diversity. The influx of immigrants from various nationalities has contributed to the country's technological advancements, cultural richness, and economic prosperity. The diversity of its population has made the US a hub for international businesses, education, and tourism, thereby accelerating its development.On the other hand, a mixture of nationalities can also foster creativity, tolerance, and understanding among citizens. In countries like Canada and Australia, which have a high percentage of foreign-born residents, there is a strong sense of community and social cohesion. The diversity of their populations has enabled them to become more open-minded and receptive to new ideas, which in turn has contributed to their economic and social growth.However, it is also important to acknowledge that a diverse population can also pose challenges, such as integration and language barriers. Nevertheless, with effective management and policies, these challenges can be overcome, and the benefits of diversity can be fully realized.In conclusion, I firmly believe that a country with a mixture of nationalities is more likely to be interesting and develop quickly. The exchange of ideas, cultures, and experiences that occurs in a multicultural society can drive innovation, creativity, and progress, ultimately contributing to the country's growth and prosperity.
1374;Advertising affects what people think is important and has a negative effect on their lives (agree/disagree);Today people are surrounded by advertising. This affects what people think is important and has a negative impact on people’s lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?With the advent of the Internet, advertisements, originally displayed only on TV, billboards, posters and so on, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and commonplace for the general public. In my view, this kind of impact could be both crucial and, on a certain level, detrimental.On the one hand, this phenomenon could denote that although we have already had a diverse range of , people are still capable of inventing innovative approaches catering for all kinds of requirements of advertising. It is a symbol that demonstrates the creativity rooted in human beings. Apart from that, it also represents that the speed of spreading information is conspicuously escalating. More purposeful is, therefore, the fact that, besides booming of the advertising, it constitutes a major reason why people could be so prosperous in this digital age.On the other hand, there are various unpleasant consequences as well. Firstly, with the omnipresent , it could potentially cause people to do impulsive shopping. Secondly, the , if regulated in a mismanaged , could make people constantly feel uncomfortable or annoyed. In this sense, instead of being an instrumental tool to promote amenities, advertisements could be considered a hindrance when people are frequently blocked by them. Furthermore, it would cost one precious time to have to sift the helpful ad from a host of others.In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, advertising is a beneficial phenomenon for all with a number of insignificant drawbacks. I believe that in the future we can improve the way advertising is done at present, and embrace the positive influence of advertising even further in the long run.This essay is another example of what Band 8 writing may look like. It’s weak point is that the author goes slightly off-topic while trying to discuss whether advertising affects what people view as important and instead talks about the reason advertising is spreading and about human creativity. However, the other part of task type (negative effects of advertising) is covered well, the ideas are well-developed and supported. There is a clear logical flow of information and a range of transitional words is used appropriately to sequence ideas. The way author uses synonyms to rephrase the task topic in the intro paragraph demonstrates their lexical skill, which is also evident in other parts of this essay. There are many complex sentences and very few errors. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.0.;I agree that advertising affects what people think is important and has a negative effect on their lives. Advertising has become an integral part of our daily lives, influencing our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Through various media channels, including social media, television, and billboards, advertisements shape our perceptions of what is desirable, important, and necessary.One of the primary ways advertising impacts our lives is by creating unrealistic expectations and promoting materialism. Advertisements often portray idealized and unattainable lifestyles, fostering a sense of dissatisfaction and inadequacy among viewers. This can lead to a never-ending pursuit of consumer goods and services, which can result in financial stress, debt, and decreased overall well-being. Furthermore, the constant bombardment of advertisements can contribute to a sense of anxiety and decreased self-esteem, as individuals feel pressured to conform to societal norms and expectations.Moreover, advertising can also manipulate people's values and priorities, shifting their focus away from what is truly important in life. By emphasizing the importance of physical appearance, wealth, and status, advertisements can distract individuals from more meaningful and fulfilling aspects of life, such as relationships, personal growth, and contributions to society. This can lead to a sense of disconnection and disorientation, as individuals become more focused on external validation and material possessions rather than internal fulfillment and personal values.In conclusion, advertising has a profound impact on what people think is important and can have a negative effect on their lives. By promoting materialism, creating unrealistic expectations, and manipulating values, advertisements can contribute to decreased well-being, anxiety, and disorientation. It is essential for individuals to develop a critical awareness of advertising's influence and to cultivate a more balanced and authentic sense of what is truly important in life.
1395;Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone’s life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is a negative one. Discuss both views and include your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. You should write at least 250 words.;Many people wonder about . Some people think that it has negative impact in our life. However, positive effect on this world.? Of Course for several reasons: firstly, it motivates the psychological point in everyone, and women in particular. They will run to buy this advertised product especially if it’s from , just to show their beauty to men, which may lead to negative effects of too much sexual attention. Secondly, you can sit comfortably with your family and suddenly the telephone is ringing, but it’s nothing important, it’s just another company to convince you to buy one of their products. It is a real . Lastly, sometimes you do not have the financial ability to buy something, but with these new methods of advertisement, you run to buy it, which affect your budget.On the other hand, there are some good sides to advertising. For instance, it compares the prices of many companies which the consumer. Besides, it really see more products which we unless the TV or Radio advertised them. , it breaks our daily routine and allows us to see new faces and learn the language better with the help of the daily updates they deliver through .In conclusion, as we can see there are many aspects to this . I feel that we gain no benefits at all from advertisement, it plays buy more things that they do not need it at all.;Advertising is indeed an integral part of our daily lives, and its impact on us is a topic of ongoing debate. On the one hand, some people believe that advertising has a positive influence on our lives. They argue that it informs us about new products, services, and ideas, which can improve our living standards and provide us with more choices. For instance, advertisements for life-saving medicines or health awareness campaigns can educate people about diseases and their prevention. Moreover, advertising can also promote cultural and social values, such as equality and environmental protection, through powerful and thought-provoking messages.On the other hand, some individuals view advertising as a negative aspect of our lives. They claim that it manipulates people into buying unnecessary products, creates unrealistic expectations, and promotes materialism. Additionally, advertising can also be misleading or deceptive, leading consumers to make poor purchasing decisions. For example, some advertisements for food products or cosmetics often make exaggerated claims or use false images, which can be harmful to consumers. Furthermore, advertising can also be intrusive and annoying, such as spam emails, pop-up ads, or loud commercials, which can disrupt our daily activities and cause frustration.In my opinion, advertising can be both positive and negative, depending on how it is used. While it can provide useful information and promote important values, it can also be manipulative and misleading. To make advertising a positive part of our lives, companies and advertisers should prioritize honesty, transparency, and social responsibility. They should strive to create ads that are informative, entertaining, and respectful of consumers' time and intelligence. By doing so, advertising can become a valuable tool for educating and empowering people, rather than a source of annoyance and frustration. Ultimately, it is up to us as consumers to critically evaluate advertisements and make informed decisions about the products and services we choose to support.
845;Boxing is a blood sport which often results in physical injury. It is inappropriate for this sport to exist in the modern age.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;There is debatable issue as to whether boxing, a seemingly bloody sport, should be excluded from the modern society. As far as I am concerned, the attempt to remove boxing from the current age is utterly unjustified.Admittedly, boxing is often associated with various disturbing factors, such as foul language, disregard to rivals, violent punches and inelegant appearance as a result of intense physical contacts. However, such gory scenes may frequently take place in underground boxing games which are barely recognised by the professional community of boxing and by the legal system. Unlike underground boxing, professional boxing upholds moral principles and universal values, for examples, respect to opponents, obedience of rules, etc. Also, professional boxers are protected by safety equipment and judges who may stop the game when witnessing any player suffering serious injuries. Therefore, the health hazards involved in boxing games may not be as severe as the public assumes.Another reason reinforcing my position is that boxing already enjoys considerable popularity around the world and plays an important part in people's entertainment, as exemplified by the successful ticket sales of most boxing games and high audience rating of TV programmes broadcasting boxing matches. Given such popularity of boxing, the removal of this sport may cause widespread dissatisfaction and complaint.To draw a conclusion, the exclusion of boxing is completely groundless and irrational, given the safety protection, sportmanship and popularity as reflected in this sport. I expect in the future, more views could arise to furnish the understanding in this regard.;The existence of boxing as a sport in the modern age has been a topic of controversy, with some arguing that it is a blood sport that has no place in contemporary society. While it is true that boxing can result in physical injury, I disagree that it is inappropriate for the sport to exist. One of the primary reasons for this is that boxing, like any other contact sport, carries inherent risks that participants are aware of and willing to take. Boxers undergo rigorous training and preparation to minimize the risk of injury, and safety measures such as mandatory medical checks and protective gear are in place to ensure their well-being. Moreover, many boxers and boxing organizations prioritize the health and safety of participants, emphasizing the importance of responsible and safe conduct within the sport.Another argument against the abolition of boxing is its potential benefits. Boxing can be a powerful tool for social mobility and personal development, particularly for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds. It teaches discipline, hard work, and resilience, which are valuable life skills. For example, the famous boxer Manny Pacquiao, who rose from poverty to become a world champion, is a testament to the transformative power of boxing.It's also worth noting that boxing has evolved over the years, with advancements in medical care and safety protocols significantly reducing the risk of serious injury. Additionally, the sport has a rich cultural and historical significance, with many regarding it as an art form that requires skill, strategy, and athleticism.In conclusion, while boxing does carry risks of physical injury, I believe that with proper safety measures, regulations, and a culture of responsibility, it can continue to exist in the modern age. Its benefits, including its role in personal development and social mobility, along with its cultural significance, outweigh the arguments against it.
1429;Boys are most influenced by their fathers and girls are most influenced by their mothers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons to support your opinion.;It is true that nowadays have a great influence children. Some people hold the opinion that the same sex is the major determination of influencing parent, but others . As far as I am concerned, . My arguments for this point are listed below.First of all, a father is the person who have already passed ways his son is passing now, in other words, sons are following their father’s footsteps. , based on experience it is easy for a father to notice his sons’ drawbacks and to influence them.Secondly, it is true that a boy is , a girl is a subtle and fragile one. It is hard for mothers to influence their sons, because it is not likely that can affect a strong one.In conclusion, it seems to me unfair that boys are most influenced by their mothers. Based on at least two points above I strongly agree that children are influenced by a parent of the same gender.;The notion that boys are most influenced by their fathers and girls are most influenced by their mothers is a common stereotype. However, I disagree with this statement. While it is true that parents can have a significant impact on their children's development, the idea that the influence is strictly divided along gender lines is oversimplified.In reality, both mothers and fathers can have a profound impact on their children, regardless of gender. Children often look up to both parents as role models and learn from their experiences, values, and behaviors. For instance, a boy may learn about emotional intelligence and empathy from his mother, while a girl may learn about self-reliance and resilience from her father. Moreover, in many families, parents share childcare responsibilities and provide equal guidance and support to their children, making it difficult to pinpoint a single parent as the primary influence.Furthermore, research has shown that children's development is influenced by a complex array of factors, including family dynamics, social environment, and individual personality. A child's relationship with their parents is unique and can be shaped by various factors, such as parental involvement, communication style, and conflict resolution. Therefore, it is unrealistic to assume that boys are solely influenced by their fathers and girls by their mothers.In conclusion, while parents undoubtedly play a crucial role in shaping their children's development, the influence is not strictly divided along gender lines. Both mothers and fathers can have a profound impact on their children, and the nature of this influence is complex and multifaceted. It is essential to recognize and appreciate the diversity of family relationships and the various ways in which parents can influence their children's growth and development.
1364;Changing drivers age limits is the best way to reduce traffic accidents (from Target Band ;This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskThe best way to reduce traffic accidents is to raise the age limit for younger drivers and to lower the age limit for elderly ones. Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsIn today’s world the number of traffic accidents is constantly rising as well as the number of injuries and deaths they cause. A better regulative approach is required traffic accidents can be reduced. Some people say that changing the drivers’ age limits is the best solution to the problem. However, there are other, more practical ways to deal with this problem.One alternative is imposing heavier fines the drivers who exceed the permitted alcohol consumption. According to recent , a great proportion of traffic accidents has alcohol as its reason. Utilising technology and installing devices that detect drunk drivers and lock car ignition can be used to keep people with track record of drunk driving off the roads. On some occasions and for repeat offenders in particular, a prison sentence may also be considered.Furthermore, people should be better educated and more careful while behind the wheel. To be more specific, people should learn to obey road rules and respect the other drivers instead of causing tension or submitting to road rage. In addition, heavy fines should also be levied for exceeded speed limits. Last but not least, safer and wider roads should be constructed to make for easier and more comfortable driving.Tightening age limits for drivers can be a complementary approach. For example, the elderly with vision problems or other important health issues should be excluded from driving. Besides, young people under 18 years old are considered immature to drive. However, maturity does not necessarily always increases with one’s age, which is why other measures are needed dangerous driving.In conclusion, I believe that stronger measures should be implemented for the prevention of traffic accidents, and drivers should have a more responsible attitude. Setting age limits could be helpful but should not be considered the optimal and only solution to the problem.The writer’s position is clear throughout the essay. There is a logical organisation of information and effective use of paragraphing. The range of vocabulary is wide enough for the student to show flexibility and accuracy of expression. Overall, the control of grammar and punctuation is good, with only a few errors made. The essay is up to the mark and is likely to get Band 8 in IELTS.;The proposition of changing driver's age limits as a means to reduce traffic accidents has sparked intense debate. While some argue that altering the age limits is the most effective way to curb road accidents, the reality is more complex. On one hand, changing the driving age limit may prevent accidents caused by inexperienced young drivers. It is well documented that novice drivers, particularly those in their teens, are more prone to accidents due to their lack of driving experience and tendency to take risks. By increasing the driving age, the number of accidents attributed to this demographic could potentially decrease. However, this solution is overly simplistic and does not address the root causes of traffic accidents. Factors such as poor road conditions, vehicle maintenance, and reckless driving behaviors among all age groups contribute significantly to the incidence of accidents. Moreover, changing the driving age limit could have unintended consequences, as it may lead to a surge in unlicensed driving among youths, thereby increasing the risk of accidents. A more comprehensive approach would involve enhancing driver education programs, improving road infrastructure, and enforcing stricter traffic laws. This multifaceted strategy would not only reduce the number of accidents among young drivers but also address the broader issue of road safety. Furthermore, it would be more effective to implement a graduated licensing system that phases in driving privileges, allowing new drivers to gain experience under controlled conditions. In conclusion, while altering the driving age limit may have some benefits, it is not the most effective or practical solution to reducing traffic accidents. A more holistic approach that targets the underlying causes of accidents and promotes a culture of safe driving practices among all road users is needed. By adopting such a strategy, we can create safer roads for everyone, regardless of age.
1366;Childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents (agree/disagree);"Childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion and include relevant examples.It is true that parents need some knowledge and experience in order to raise their in an appropriate way. In this regard, many families attend different training courses. While I agree that these courses might be useful for some of them, I totally disagree with the recommended obligatory of such training.On the one hand, training courses usually offered by governments could be very useful for those guardians who have a with special needs. For example, if a child has a birth defect or has been diagnosed with any mental or musculoskeletal disorders, these kinds of training could be lifesaving. Additionally, as we know, the first few months after birth are really a crucial period of a child’s life; parents should obtain different information related to their child’s vaccinations, common health problems, different developmental issues and so on, which can be delivered through such training courses.On the other hand, I believe that making these programs a mandatory option would cause several problems for societies and individuals as well. To begin with, in order to achieve this goal, many professionals should be trained which may not be affordable for some governments. From an individual’s point of view, this kind of programs could be very time-consuming for some families who have other at home or who work long hours. The other important consideration is that parent training courses may not provide all the necessary information for each and every family. To be more specific, parents could get more beneficial information through different websites such as YouTube according to their own preferences.In conclusion, although I believe that many families can take advantage training courses, I do believe that making them a compulsory option for everyone is too time and money-consuming for individuals and governments.The introduction is very good and relevant. The writer’s position is balanced, relevantly and properly developed in two body paragraphs. The conclusion summarizes both sides of the argument and logically finished the essay. To maintain the necessary level of formality the word ‘kids’ should be replaced with ‘children’ everywhere in this essay. The use of prepositions needs more attention as some are inappropriate or incorrect. The length could be reduced – it’s not necessary to write a very long essay to get a higher score, and often it is better to write a shorter essay (no shorter than 250 words though!) but spend more time proofreading, correcting errors and improving the quality of writing. Overall this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.";I disagree that childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents. While it is undeniable that parenting is a significant responsibility and that equipping parents with the necessary skills can be beneficial, there are several reasons why making such courses compulsory may not be the most effective approach.Firstly, mandating childcare training courses could be perceived as an overreach of government authority into personal family matters. Parenting is a highly personal and individualized experience, and what works for one family may not work for another. Imposing a one-size-fits-all solution could lead to resentment and decreased participation.Secondly, not all parents may need or benefit from such training. Many parents already possess the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively care for their children, either through experience, education, or natural ability. Additionally, the quality and content of these courses could vary significantly, potentially leading to inconsistent outcomes.Moreover, the implementation of mandatory childcare training courses raises practical concerns, such as accessibility, affordability, and the potential for increased stress on already overwhelmed new parents. It could also inadvertently stigmatize parents who may struggle with the demands of childcare, potentially leading to decreased self-esteem and confidence in their parenting abilities.Instead of making these courses mandatory, it would be more beneficial to ensure that they are widely available, easily accessible, and optionally taken by those who feel they would benefit from them. This approach respects the autonomy of parents while still providing support and resources to those who need or want them. By promoting a culture of voluntary improvement and support, rather than enforcing a blanket requirement, we can better foster a community that values and empowers all parents in their unique parenting journeys.
1384;Children should be engaged in paid work, agree or disagree?;"In many countries children are engaged in different kinds of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?The issue of whether or not children should be engaged in some paid work has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that having some employment experience is conducive to a child’s learning and development, I contend that it would bring harm to the child’s and learning.First of all, a workplace designed for adults normally child-friendly facilities. Desks and chairs are too high for a child; the light switches are installed on the walls unreachable children; also emergency training and facilities such as phones are only provided to adults. Furthermore, various hazards such as polluted air and chemical fumes are still produced in factories and farms. Undoubtedly young people would suffer in such workplaces.Also, children would find it frustrating when they are not properly inducted before starting a job. A child working in a cement factory would feel a setback when he could not get immediate support while struggling with the procedures of recording different raw materials that required by the job. Further, without sufficient support, a child’s misunderstanding or inappropriately communicating with adults would only disappoint him and prevents him from active learning and interacting with other people.To conclude, a child’s paid employment experience would lead to a negative impact on their health and active learning. However, recognizing the importance of children’s learning and their awareness of responsibility, it is advisable to encourage them to be involved in some volunteering opportunities where they can meaningfully learn and interact with other people with sufficient care and support in place for such jobs.This is a good essay. There are only a few errors (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections), but otherwise this work seems worthy of Band 7.5 or 8. Remember to always proofread your essay before submitting it. Keep up the good work!";The notion that children should be engaged in paid work is a highly debated topic. While some argue that it can provide them with valuable skills and financial independence, I strongly disagree. Engaging children in paid work can have severe negative consequences on their physical, emotional, and educational well-being.Firstly, children's primary responsibility is to attend school and focus on their education. Paid work can distract them from their studies, leading to poor academic performance and a lack of foundational knowledge. Moreover, the physical and mental demands of paid work can be detrimental to their health and development. Children are still growing and need time to play, rest, and engage in activities that promote their physical and emotional growth.Furthermore, paid work can expose children to exploitation and abuse. Without proper regulations and protections, children may be forced to work in hazardous conditions, for long hours, and for minimal pay. This can lead to a lifetime of physical and emotional trauma, and undermine their ability to reach their full potential. Additionally, paid work can also deprive children of their childhood, a critical period of development that shapes their identity, social skills, and emotional intelligence.Instead of engaging children in paid work, I believe that we should focus on providing them with opportunities for skill development, volunteer work, and extracurricular activities that promote their physical, emotional, and educational growth. This can help them develop important life skills, build their confidence and self-esteem, and prepare them for adulthood without compromising their childhood. In conclusion, engaging children in paid work is not an appropriate or beneficial solution, and we should prioritize their education, health, and well-being above any potential financial gain.
1383;Children these days are suffering from obesity, why and how can it be solved?;Modern children are suffering from the diseases that were once considered to be meant for adults only. Obesity is a major disease prevalent among children. What are its causes and what solutions can be offered?Nowadays, the increasing rate of overweight children and adults is a worldwide health issue. Obesity is a major problem which is increasing day by day in children. There are various reasons behind it. This essay will discuss the causes of obesity and offer some solutions.The first cause of obesity is junk food. It is often seen that mostly children are fond of burgers, pizzas, noodles and . These types of foods are easily available to them in school canteens. Children love to purchase chips, , ice-cream for lunch. Moreover, in this modern era, parents are working and they do not have time to cook at home. Parents often buy dinner for their children instead of preparing food at home. This calorie-rich diet is making children obese. This problem can be solved by teaching children to cook healthy foods for themselves and banning junk foods and fizzy drinks in schools. This diet can be replaced by milk, juice and fruits for lunch.The second cause of obesity is . It is true that the use of computers and television is increasing children. They spend most of their time watching television or playing video games on a computer. This technological advancement has reduced the level of physical activity in this specific age group. This issue can be resolved by encouraging children to do physical exercises. Parents can take their children to park to encourage playing with friends. Furthermore, schools can add sports in their curriculum to maintain physical fitness in their students.To sum up, it is clear that main causes of obesity are unhealthy eating and not enough physical activities. This ailment can be prevented and treated by healthy eating and physical exercises.This is a good essay. There are only a few minor errors that could have been easily prevented by proofreading this essay one last time before submission (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). Overall, this work seems worthy of IELTS Band 8. Keep up the good work!;The rising prevalence of obesity among children has become a pressing concern globally. According to recent studies, the number of obese children has skyrocketed, with approximately one in five children being overweight or obese. This alarming trend can be attributed to a combination of factors, including sedentary lifestyles, unhealthy eating habits, and lack of physical activity.One of the primary reasons for childhood obesity is the increased consumption of junk food and sugary drinks. Many children are drawn to processed and high-calorie foods, which are readily available and often marketed towards them. Furthermore, the proliferation of screens, such as TVs, computers, and mobile devices, has led to a decline in physical activity, as children spend more time engaging in sedentary behaviors.To combat this issue, a multi-faceted approach is necessary. Firstly, parents and caregivers must take responsibility for promoting healthy eating habits and encouraging physical activity. This can be achieved by providing nutritious meals, limiting screen time, and engaging children in outdoor activities or sports. Additionally, schools can play a vital role by incorporating physical education and health classes into their curricula, as well as providing healthy meal options in cafeterias.Moreover, governments and policymakers must also take action by implementing policies that promote healthy lifestyles, such as increasing funding for physical education programs and restricting the marketing of unhealthy foods to children. Community-based initiatives, such as building parks and playgrounds, can also help to increase physical activity among children. By working together, we can help to reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity and ensure that future generations lead healthy, active, and fulfilling lives. Ultimately, it is our collective responsibility to address this pressing issue and provide children with the foundation for a healthy and happy life.
857;Competitiveness is a positive quality for people in most societies. How does competitiveness affect individuals? Is it a positive or negative trend?;Life is full of competition. Soon after the release from competitive university exams, the hard fighting for higher positions in a company will be waiting for you. While the competitiveness has been bringing us a convenient society, no small number of employments have been tired of never-ending competitions. No doubt about a positive effect on societies, but when we start to argue about the effect on individuals, it becomes more controversial. This essay will argue the drawbacks of competitiveness for individuals, especially from the perspective of Japanese modern society and typical Japanese office workers. I believe that cooperativeness and uniqueness are sometimes more important attitude than competitiveness.Firstly, competitiveness causes less diversity. If there is a competition, there must be the same evaluation metrics to differentiate winners and losers. The evaluation procedure needs to limit the metrics into specific aspects of the human being. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to prove that the metrics are proper for all of the possible cases and effective for the HR evaluation. For example, Japanese companies are likely to judge quantitatively based on the numbers related to performance. However, how can we evaluate the cooperativity or the non-quantitative performance like in creative jobs? Most Japanese companies adopted the HR evaluation methods based on average working hours per day and number of reports monthly. That’s why the Japanese tend to overwork to fulfill this requirement. In addition, as a result of placing more importance in quantity of reports, rather than quality, Japanese employees are prone to choose easy and short-term tasks or outsourcing instead of building by their own methods. This tendency causes fewer complicated and long-term tasks.Secondly, competitiveness causes less cooperativeness. Fewer people volunteer to play a disadvantageous role for smooth teamwork. Moreover, some people play an evil role by blaming or cheating the competitors in order to be superior to them. As a consequence, overall efficiency will decline and some people will be overestimated. Even if there are no problems temporarily, the long-lasting large companies will eventually become corrupt, and those who have the most political power, rather than real power, will remain at the top.Consequently, competitiveness is the basis of capitalism which brings us a brighter and more convenient society, however, biased evaluation and less cooperative working environment possibly drive people into nervous breakdowns. Karoshi, overwork death derived from too much stress and less sleeping, is one of the most serious social problems in Japan. We may need to rethink about the competitiveness.;In most societies, competitiveness is viewed as a valuable trait, driving individuals to strive for excellence and push beyond their limits. The impact of competitiveness on individuals is multifaceted, with both positive and negative consequences. On the one hand, competitiveness can foster a strong work ethic, motivate individuals to achieve their goals, and enhance their self-esteem. It encourages people to innovate, take risks, and develop resilience, which are essential skills for success in various aspects of life.Moreover, a competitive environment can promote healthy rivalries, where individuals learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses, and develop strategies to improve themselves. This, in turn, can lead to personal growth, improved performance, and a sense of accomplishment. Competitiveness also prepares individuals for the challenges of the real world, where they will inevitably face competition in their careers, education, and other areas of life.On the other hand, excessive competitiveness can have detrimental effects on individuals. It can lead to stress, anxiety, and an overemphasis on winning, rather than learning and self-improvement. When individuals become overly competitive, they may prioritize success over relationships, mental health, and overall well-being. Furthermore, an overly competitive environment can foster a cutthroat mentality, where people are willing to do whatever it takes to succeed, even if it means compromising their values and ethics.In conclusion, while competitiveness can be a positive quality, driving individuals to achieve their full potential, it is essential to strike a balance between competitiveness and other values such as cooperation, empathy, and self-awareness. When channeled constructively, competitiveness can be a powerful tool for personal growth and success, but when taken to an extreme, it can have negative consequences for individuals and society as a whole.
425;Computers are now the basis of the modern world. They should therefore be introduced into classrooms, and their programs used for direct teaching purposes. However, dependence on computers in teaching may carry a certain degree of risk to students.Discuss both sides and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Computers are presntly an integral part of the civilized world and are essential to daily living. Some individuals believe that they should be introduced into the classroom and used for teaching purposes while others are of the opinion that dependence on computers in teaching may pose a risk to students.Introducing computers and their programs in educational instuitions for learning purposes is a beneficial thing to students. The world is fast changing and students need to meet up and be at par with others in the world. The globe is becoming a more digital place and computers are the core of that, teaching using computers will open students' minds to new possibilitiies, faster approaches and more advanced ways of solving problems. A recent study showed that 75% of students who were taught using computers are currently more successful than others in their work places.It is understandable that people also think that dependence on computers in teaching may be detrimental to students. The students may become lazy and may not necessarily want to use their brains to calculate or understand things because the computer has already done that for them. Also using computers to learn in the school environment is also just adding to screen time for the learners; they are already being exposed to lots of wrong things at home adding school to it may not neceesarily the best option.Personally, students have a lot to learn using computers but truthfully speaking most of them already have the technological know how when it comes to using computers and if they actually want to learn more about how to use them, they can do so at home using the popular learning sites, it doesnt necessarily have to be introduced into the school learning system.In conclusion,computers are currently the foundation of the modern world and have their advantages and disadvantages, if they are put to the right use at the appropriate place and time, its benefits are beyond measure.";The integration of computers into classrooms has been a topic of debate in recent years. On one hand, introducing computers into classrooms can enhance the learning experience for students. Computers and their programs can provide interactive and engaging lessons, making complex concepts easier to understand. For instance, educational software can be used to create virtual labs, where students can conduct experiments and investigations in a safe and controlled environment. Additionally, computers can provide access to a vast amount of information, allowing students to research and learn at their own pace.On the other hand, dependence on computers in teaching can carry a certain degree of risk to students. Over-reliance on technology can lead to a lack of basic skills, such as handwriting and calculation. Moreover, computers can be a distraction, with students potentially using them for non-educational purposes, such as social media and games. For example, a study found that students who used computers in classrooms spent more time on non-educational activities than on learning. Furthermore, computers can also limit face-to-face interaction between students and teachers, which is essential for developing social and communication skills.In my opinion, computers should be introduced into classrooms, but in a balanced and controlled manner. Computers can be a valuable tool in enhancing the learning experience, but they should not replace traditional teaching methods. Teachers should ensure that students are using computers for educational purposes only and that they are developing basic skills, such as handwriting and calculation. For example, a teacher can assign a project that requires students to use computers for research, but also requires them to present their findings in a handwritten report. By finding a balance between technology and traditional teaching methods, students can benefit from the advantages of computers while minimizing the risks.
1329;Crime rates are likely to decline due to the advancements in technology, which will help prevent and solve crimes in an easier way. Do you agree or disagree?;"Nowadays technology is advancing faster than ever and many fields are benefitting from the opportunities this trend presents. Some think that crime prevention can be one possible application of new technologies, by allowing to deter offenders or solve crimes in a faster and easier way. In my opinion, innovation in crime prevention can be a game-changer that will reduce both the number of crimes committed and the time it takes to catch those responsible for them.Not everyone is optimistic about the prospects of the use of new technologies in crime prevention, and those who subscribe to the more pessimistic view say that advanced technologies can be accessed by criminals, therefore raising the crime rates. Such tools can, indeed, cause more damage if they fall in the wrong hands; however, it would require the offenders to be highly skilled to be able to use the modern technologies. Statistically, many of them tend to have a lower level of education, and for that reason they are likely to stick to the old ways of committing crimes, whereas the minority of highly skilled criminals are unlikely to make a big difference to the crime levels.Law enforcement workforce, on the other hand, has a much better grip on modern technology. Nowadays police officers and detectives undergo special training, take regular skill update courses, and use high-tech equipment. Facial recognition and thermal imaging are just two examples of the important tools that police are already using to find and catch offenders faster. Ordinary citizens can do their part in preventing burglaries by installing sophisticated systems with sensors, CCTV video feed and various alarms to detect and deter thieves. The combined effort will, no doubt, push the crime curve down.To sum up, even though the wonders of technology are available to everyone, it seems to me that they will better assist law enforcement in solving crimes, and law-abiding citizens in protecting themselves and their property, rather than felons. This will tip the balance in favour of reduction in crime rate and make the world a safer place.";The notion that crime rates will decline due to advancements in technology is a widely debated topic. In my opinion, I agree that technological advancements will lead to a reduction in crime rates. One of the primary reasons for this is the enhanced ability to prevent and solve crimes with greater ease. With the advent of technologies such as CCTV cameras, artificial intelligence, and data analytics, law enforcement agencies are better equipped to monitor and track criminal activity. For instance, the use of facial recognition software and license plate readers has made it possible to identify and apprehend criminals more efficiently. Moreover, the ability to analyze vast amounts of data has enabled authorities to identify patterns and predict potential crime hotspots, allowing for more targeted and effective policing.Additionally, technology has also empowered citizens to take a more active role in preventing and reporting crimes. Mobile applications and online platforms have made it easier for individuals to report suspicious activity and share information with the authorities. This increased civic engagement, coupled with the improved capabilities of law enforcement, is likely to deter potential criminals and reduce the overall crime rate.However, it is also important to acknowledge that technology can be a double-edged sword, as it also provides new opportunities for criminal activity, such as cybercrime and online fraud. Nonetheless, I firmly believe that the benefits of technological advancements in preventing and solving crimes far outweigh the potential drawbacks. As technology continues to evolve and improve, it is likely to play an increasingly significant role in reducing crime rates and creating safer communities. Ultimately, the effective utilization of technology by law enforcement agencies and citizens alike will be crucial in harnessing its potential to combat crime.

It is reasonable to suggest that dieting is effective for controlling our body weight within an ideal range in order to achieve the normal score of body mass index (BMI), which is essential for preventing us from overweight or obese. As a result, the risk of suffering an illness will be reduced. A recent research concluded that dieting is one of the most effective measures to cut down one’s body weight among the obese group, and it helps to improve their medical condition indirectly.Moreover, dieting is crucial for keeping ideal body features regardless of gender and age. A fit and presentable body outlook absolutely boosts up one’s level in his or her social life, not to mention professions that require keeping one’s body in an attractive physical shape. For example, dieting is adopted as a popular way for reducing weight among actors and actresses. A recent article reported that an actress who successfully regained her slim body after a period of dieting was offered an excellent job opportunity in the Hollywood film industry.In conclusion, in my opinion dieting has a positive influence on one’s life in terms of maintaining a profound level of health and keeping a more attractive body outlook.The writer’s opinion is very clear from the start and throughout the entire essay.

Dieting, in particular, can be a double-edged sword, capable of transforming a person's life for better or worse. On one hand, a well-planned diet can have a profoundly positive effect on an individual's life. By adopting a balanced and nutritious diet, people can experience significant weight loss, improved energy levels, and enhanced mental clarity. A healthy diet has also been shown to reduce the risk of chronic diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease, thereby increasing life expectancy and quality of life.On the other hand, dieting can also have detrimental consequences if not approached correctly. Severe calorie restriction or the adoption of fad diets can lead to malnutrition, fatigue, and a preoccupation with food. Moreover, eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia can develop as a result of an unhealthy obsession with dieting. Furthermore, the constant pressure to maintain an unrealistic body image can lead to low self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. It is essential, therefore, to approach dieting in a balanced and sustainable manner, focusing on gradual lifestyle changes rather than quick fixes or miracle solutions.In conclusion, dieting has the potential to either positively or negatively impact a person's life, depending on the approach taken. While a well-planned diet can lead to improved physical and mental health, a misguided or excessive approach to dieting can have severe and long-lasting consequences. Ultimately, it is crucial to prioritize a balanced and sustainable relationship with food, rather than striving for unrealistic beauty standards or quick weight loss solutions. By doing so, individuals can ensure that their dieting journey is a positive and transformative experience."
1417;Dieting can change a person’s life for the better or ruins one’s health completely. What is your opinion?;Almost of the women today want a beautiful figure. That is why we are able to find a diet programme almost everywhere in the country. Most of the women have and gone on a diet before either to or just health problem.A proper diet programme will help you not only to slim down but also to have a eating habits.

1409;Dieting can change a person’s life for the better or ruins one’s health completely. What’s your opinion?;Dieting seems to be of our life in this modern society, especially for those who are health conscious. Different people choose different type of dieting methods, trying to achieve what they believe to be good for either their health or physical appearance. In general, most of the people who diet are focusing on controlling their weight.In our urban society, most of the working class not have the opportunity to consume . Their daily meals consist of fast food which contains large amounts of fat and salt. The most significant of this unhealthy lifestyle is the weight gain especially among those middle age working professionals.Therefore, most of these young and energetic people have to control their diet in order to stay in shape either for their appearance or health. The most common and proper method of maintaining one’s weight is eating less oily food, preferably more green vegetables, fruits and alcohol.However, some have resorted to losing weight by taking their diet to the extreme, not eating at all for days. Others will make themselves vomit after each meal. Many others will go for dieting medication and beverages that help them to lose their appetite. These unhealthy will cause internal damage in the long run.In my opinion, dieting for better health is more important than solely for looking attractive. Individuals who wish to control their weight should seek professional if they are unable to reduce their weight after switching over to a healthy diet for a period of time. Losing weight and losing your health at the same time does not benefit any individual.This essay needs some work.

The second body paragraph explains how to diet, whereas it should present arguments for or against dieting. Therefore, the task is only partially covered here.;The concept of dieting has become a ubiquitous aspect of modern life, with many individuals adopting various diets in pursuit of a healthier and more desirable physique.

1323;Discipline is a growing problem in modern schools. Some people think that parents should discipline their own children, while others think it should be the responsibility of the government. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;While some people argue that parents should take sole responsibility for disciplining their children, others take the view that the government should be in charge of such matters. In my opinion, the young generation should be primarily guided by their parents where rules of behavior and moral principles are concerned. However, in some instances government intervention is necessary.On one side of the argument, there are people who hold the opinion that the responsibility of disciplining a child falls squarely on parents’ shoulders, since they are their first educators, and it is their duty to equip their children with good manners and morals even before their first day at school. In addition, every family has a unique understanding of what a suitable form of discipline entails. Therefore, some parents are concerned that any form of punishment meted out at school might be too harsh. To overcome this issue, they believe that parents should be informed by the school of their child’s wrongdoing so that they could decide an appropriate consequence for their behavior at home.Unfortunately, not all parents are objective enough to make the right decisions when it comes to the upbringing of their children. Some may lack information or sound moral background to discipline their children in a meaningful way. Therefore, the state should shoulder some of the responsibility by implementing a strict set of guidelines and policies on how to discipline children at school. I believe that such policies result in children who flourish and are more likely to become productive citizens that actively contribute to a prosperous nation. Also, this would help both parents and teachers understand which punishments are suitable for minor infractions like missing an assignment or major incidents like bullying or skipping school.In conclusion, while both views are commonly held in society, I believe that the government must be actively involved in the policies related to discipline at schools as this would ensure the well-being and successful development of the youth.;The issue of discipline in modern schools has sparked a heated debate about who should be responsible for disciplining children. While some argue that parents should take on this role, others believe that the government should be held accountable. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and provide my opinion.On the one hand, some people believe that parents should discipline their own children. This viewpoint is based on the idea that parents know their children best and are therefore better equipped to provide the necessary guidance and discipline. Additionally, parents are responsible for their child's upbringing and should be held accountable for their behavior. By disciplining their own children, parents can instill values and morals that are essential for their child's development.On the other hand, some people argue that the government should take on the responsibility of disciplining children in schools. This perspective is based on the idea that schools are a reflection of society and that the government has a role to play in ensuring that children behave and learn in a safe and respectful environment. Furthermore, the government has the resources and infrastructure to provide support and guidance to children who may be struggling with behavioral issues.In my opinion, I believe that discipline is a shared responsibility between parents and the government. While parents play a crucial role in shaping their child's behavior, the government also has a responsibility to provide a safe and supportive learning environment. By working together, parents,ed and the government can provide children with the guidance and discipline they need to succeed in life. Ultimately, a collaborative approach to discipline is essential for the well-being and development of children in modern schools.
1066;Eating sweet foods produces acid in the mouth, which can cause tooth decay. (High acid levels are measured by low pH values)Describe the information below and discuss the implications for dental health.;The given graph shows the level of acidity in the mouth from consuming food that contains fruit or cane sugar and honey.To start with, if we take a look at honey-consistent food, we will notice that the acid level increases within the first 5 minutes. After that, the level of acidity remains at the rate of less than 5 pH, and, then goes down to a normal level. So, it is unlikely tooth decay to occur within such a short period of time.Regarding fruit and cane sugar-consistent food, it is quite noticeable that the acidity level increases dramatically at a level of less than 5.5 pH and 4.5 pH, respectively. However, the main difference between fruit and cane sugar is that the acid level of fruit sugar decreases within a bit more than 15 minutes. In contrast to it, the acid level of cane sugar goes down to a normal level within more than 25 minutes, which is more likely to get tooth decay.;The consumption of sweet foods has been linked to the production of acid in the mouth, which can have detrimental effects on dental health. When sweet foods are ingested, the bacteria present in the mouth break them down into acids, resulting in a decrease in pH levels. This increase in acidity can lead to tooth decay, a condition characterized by the demineralization of tooth enamel and the formation of cavities.The pH levels in the mouth can drop significantly after consuming sweet foods, with some studies indicating a decrease to as low as 3.5. This acidic environment can persist for extended periods, depending on factors such as the type and amount of sweet food consumed, as well as the individual's oral hygiene habits. Prolonged exposure to low pH levels can compromise the tooth's natural defense mechanisms, allowing acid to penetrate deeper into the tooth structure and cause irreparable damage.The implications for dental health are significant, as frequent and prolonged exposure to acid can lead to the development of tooth decay and other oral health issues. Furthermore, regular consumption of sweet foods can also contribute to the progression of existing dental problems, such as sensitivity and gum disease. To mitigate these risks, it is essential to practice good oral hygiene, including regular brushing and flossing, and to limit the consumption of sweet foods and drinks. Additionally, visiting a dentist regularly for check-ups and cleanings can help identify and address any oral health issues before they become severe. By being mindful of the relationship between sweet food consumption and acid production, individuals can take proactive steps to protect their dental health and prevent the onset of tooth decay and other related problems.
1362;Education in financial management should be a mandatory component of the school program, agree/disagree (from Target Band ;This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskEducation in financial management should be a mandatory component of the school program. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsMore and more young adults in our country are heavily indebted. Thus, it is considered by some that it should be mandatory to educate school children the administration of money. In my opinion, people should not leave school without a sound knowledge of financial management.To begin with, a country’s development is strongly upon the purchasing capacity of its inhabitants. That is to say, people who are in debt or financially vulnerable, would not be able to spend freely or invest, for example, in a new house, thus hindering the economic growth of the country. As a consequence, the rate of inflation would rise and people would be able to afford even less, which could ultimately result in the collapse of the entire economy. A good example of this vicious circle can be seen in countries such as Argentina, where people have to buy household items in the black market, because they cannot afford to buy them in regular stores due to skyrocketing prices. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to teach children early money management.Another point to consider is the low standard of living that people have when they mismanage their finances. Individuals who are constantly short of money could eventually end up being socially isolated and unhappy, because they couldn’t afford to participate in leisure activities, such as going to the cinema with a friend, resulting in their from social life. However, this could be avoided with ease by offering courses in money management.In conclusion, I strongly believe that school children should be taught how to manage their finances to prevent social isolation later in their life as well as to maintain the economic force of their country.The writer’s position is clear throughout the essay. Paragraphing is used effectively to organise ideas and information, however the paragraphs could have been balanced better in terms of the amount of content. The advanced vocabulary the writer uses creates a good impression of mature and fluent writer. Overall, the control of grammar and punctuation is fine, and the number of errors is small. The essay could achieve Band 8 in IELTS.;I strongly agree that education in financial management should be a mandatory component of the school program. In today's complex and ever-changing financial landscape, it is essential for individuals to possess a solid understanding of personal finance and money management skills. By incorporating financial management into the school curriculum, students will be equipped with the knowledge and tools necessary to make informed decisions about their financial lives.Many young people leave school without a basic understanding of how to manage their finances, which can lead to poor financial decisions and a lifetime of debt. By teaching financial management in schools, students will learn vital skills such as budgeting, saving, and investing, which will benefit them throughout their lives. Moreover, financial literacy will also enable students to make smart choices about student loans, credit cards, and other financial products, thereby avoiding common pitfalls that can lead to financial difficulties.Furthermore, teaching financial management in schools can have a positive impact on society as a whole. By educating students about the importance of saving, spending, and investing, we can promote a culture of financial responsibility and stability. This, in turn, can lead to a reduction in debt, improved credit scores, and a more secure financial future for individuals and the economy as a whole.In conclusion, I firmly believe that education in financial management should be a mandatory component of the school program. By providing students with a solid foundation in financial literacy, we can empower them to make informed decisions about their financial lives and set them up for long-term financial success. This, in turn, can have a positive impact on individuals, communities, and the economy, leading to a more stable and prosperous future for all.
1421;Even though Globalization affects the world’s economics in a very positive way, its negative sides should not be forgotten. Discuss.;Everything has sides in the world, and so has the of globalization . The effects of globalization on the world economy are .We must acknowledge that the negative effects are from a different kind than the positive ones. the negative sides, like low in less developed countries are important to .If we take the Eurozone for example, the economic changes the process are huge. Many companies have transferred their factories into cheaper production to in the world . The results are rising unemployment rates in the “old industrial countries”.In regard to the other countries on the world market, such as China, this job transfer is a big opportunity. But no one can that the consequences for the less developed countries where economy flourished, based on availability of cheap employees are highly important: globalization based on this facts brings problems.Nevertheless, there are also . In general it is remarkable that there is a new tendency in “Thinking Global”. For instance, people are willing to more languages and get educated about cultures. Countries as undeveloped, such as India, are getting chances to be the in a certain field.All in all it can be said that the effects of globalization are enormous. The of economic processes has changed completely. It is important to think in bigger terms, not just about the country. The positive things that this globalization process have brought us for the negative sides. The should be a world in balance, but this has yet to come.;The advent of globalization has revolutionized the world's economics, fostering unprecedented growth and interconnectivity among nations. While its positive impacts are undeniable, the negative consequences of globalization should not be overlooked. On the one hand, globalization has opened up new markets, created jobs, and facilitated the exchange of goods, services, and ideas. This has led to increased economic growth, improved living standards, and poverty reduction in many countries.However, the darker side of globalization cannot be ignored. One of the significant drawbacks is the widening income gap between the rich and the poor. Multinational corporations, in pursuit of cheap labor and resources, often exploit workers in developing countries, perpetuating inequality and social injustice. Furthermore, globalization has also led to the decline of local industries, as small businesses struggle to compete with large multinational companies. This can result in cultural homogenization, where unique local customs and traditions are lost in the face of dominant global brands.Additionally, globalization has also been criticized for its environmental consequences. The increased transportation of goods and services has led to a significant rise in greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. The pursuit of economic growth has also led to the exploitation of natural resources, threatening biodiversity and ecosystem balance. It is essential to acknowledge and address these negative consequences to ensure that the benefits of globalization are shared equitably and sustainably. By doing so, we can work towards a more balanced and equitable form of globalization that promotes economic growth, social justice, and environmental sustainability. Ultimately, it is crucial to recognize both the positive and negative aspects of globalization to create a more just and prosperous world for all.
1319;Even though experts believe that walking is a great way to improve one’s health, very few people walk nowadays. Why aren’t people walking? What can be done to encourage them to walk more?;The benefits of walking are numerous, and experts recommend it as a good way to keep healthy and fit. Despite this, the number of people who walk on a daily basis is on the decline. The reasons for this are manifold, but there are also several solutions that may help people walk more.Lack of time is the most common reason people cite for not engaging in any form of physical activity. These days most people have hectic schedules that involve juggling their work and home responsibilities. As a result, they are often too exhausted or pressed for time and therefore opt for faster and more comfortable forms of transport, such as cars, bikes or public transport. Another major reason for the reduced number of pedestrians on the roads is a lack of safety. Most full-time workers are not free to walk during the day, and will skip it in the evenings or early morning hours, if they do not feel safe enough to do so.Fortunately, there are quite a few solutions to this issue. One is making walkers safe, which means the government should ensure that there are enough sidewalks and streetlights available in every suburb, so that pedestrians can walk or jog safely whenever time allows. Another useful option is to create special walking tracks and parks in neighbourhoods where people can get some much-needed exercise in the evenings. The added benefit of promoting the healthy lifestyle and walking in the community makes this solution even more attractive.To conclude, the pressures of daily life and lack of safely while walking reduce the popularity of this healthy practice. Governments can reverse this trend by creating more green spaces for people to walk in and addressing their safety concerns.;"Despite the numerous health benefits associated with walking, it is alarming to note that very few people incorporate walking into their daily routine. One of the primary reasons for this trend is the increasing reliance on technology and transportation. With the rise of cars, buses, and trains, people have become accustomed to convenient and quick modes of transportation, often neglecting the simplest and most effective way to stay healthy - walking. Furthermore, the sedentary nature of modern jobs, which often involve sitting for extended periods, also contributes to the decline in walking habits.Another significant factor is the lack of infrastructure that supports walking. In many cities, pedestrian paths and sidewalks are either non-existent or poorly maintained, making it difficult and unsafe for people to walk. Additionally, the allure of screen-based entertainment and social media has led to a more sedentary lifestyle, where people prefer to spend their free time indoors rather than engaging in physical activity like walking.To encourage people to walk more, governments and local authorities can play a crucial role. Investing in pedestrian-friendly infrastructure, such as well-maintained sidewalks, crosswalks, and bike lanes, can make walking a safer and more enjoyable experience. Moreover, introducing initiatives like ""walk to work"" or ""walk to school"" days can raise awareness about the benefits of walking and promote a culture of physical activity. Individuals can also make a conscious effort to incorporate walking into their daily routine, whether it's taking a short walk during lunch breaks or walking to a nearby store instead of driving. By making these small changes, we can significantly improve our health and well-being, and set a positive example for others to follow. Ultimately, it is essential that we recognize the value of walking and take collective action to promote a walking culture."
1410;Even though globalization affects the world’s economy in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. Discuss.;Everything has two sides and the globalization is not exception. Our first thoughts about this topic include the process of global “McDonaldisation” and, generally speaking, spreading across the whole Globe.Firstly, I would try to concentrate on the positive aspects of globalisation. As far as economy is concerned, like the Global Bank or IMF are always focused on developing the ‘Third World’ and helping poor people to combat their life obstacles (through loans and donations). Moreover, the world becomes an area of sharing thoughts (e.g. philosophical or economical doctrines), which become popular due to lack of barriers.However, disadvantages of globalization are also widely known. Some people insist that because of this process, the spirit of countries and nations rapidly disappears. The integrity, established years ago is on the verge of collapsing. Furthermore, there’s a strong lobby of communists who , that the globalization indicates an uncontrolled reign of capitalists and slave work of lower labour-class. We should never forget about the detrimental impact of global investments on the environment – the green house effect or soar rains are triggered by globalization.To sum up, globalization has both positive and negative influence on our everyday life. I can’t agree with the popular statement that we should try to avoid being affected by it. However, we must not forget about our surroundings and local communities. They have a great value which should last forever.;The advent of globalization has undoubtedly transformed the world's economy in numerous positive ways. It has facilitated the free flow of goods, services, and ideas across borders, leading to increased economic growth, job creation, and cultural exchange. Globalization has also enabled multinational corporations to expand their operations, creating new opportunities for investment and trade. As a result, many countries have experienced significant economic growth, lifted millions of people out of poverty, and improved their standard of living.However, despite these benefits, the negative consequences of globalization should not be overlooked. One of the major drawbacks is the widening income gap between the rich and the poor. As large corporations expand their operations, small-scale industries and local businesses often struggle to compete, leading to job losses and economic inequality. Additionally, globalization has also led to the exploitation of cheap labor in developing countries, where workers are often subjected to poor working conditions and low wages.Furthermore, globalization has also resulted in environmental degradation and cultural homogenization. The increased demand for natural resources and energy has led to pollution, deforestation, and climate change. Moreover, the dominance of Western culture and values has threatened the unique cultural identities of many societies, leading to a loss of traditional practices and customs.In conclusion, while globalization has undoubtedly brought numerous economic benefits, its negative consequences should not be forgotten. It is essential to acknowledge and address these issues to ensure that the benefits of globalization are shared equitably and sustainably. Governments, corporations, and individuals must work together to mitigate the negative effects of globalization and promote a more inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic model. By doing so, we can create a more just and equitable world where the benefits of globalization are enjoyed by all.
1306;Every household should have a government-imposed limit on the amount of rubbish it can throw away. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"The amount of waste people produce can be quite shocking, with every person generating kilograms of rubbish in a single day, and all this can be difficult to manage. This has given some people the idea that there should be a limitation on the amount of rubbish produced per household; however, opinions are divided as to whether this would be the the most effective option.Having a limitation on the amount of waste produced sounds like a fine solution to a significant problem, with over two hundred and fifty million tons being generated in 2016 by the U.S. alone. Taxing households that break limits would push people to produce less waste and make them more mindful of what can be recycled or composted. However, forcing people to produce less waste might not be attainable.Households produce as much waste as they need to live their lifestyles. The waste people generate is only a result of the products they purchase, and will most likely wish to continue to purchase. Taxing people may be a cause of resentment, with many of them already struggling to pay their usual bills. In addition, if people produce more than they are allowed, this will encourage littering and dumping, so that they are not caught with more waste than entitled, and this in turn will damage the environment.Though controlling the amount of waste produced is important, there could be other ways of encouraging lesser output. In my opinion, governments should encourage composting and recycling, which will also reduce wasted material. People should also be more aware of what waste they produce and how it can be reduced. An education drive on these issues would perhaps be more likely to succeed in reducing rubbish than imposing limitations.";The notion that every household should have a government-imposed limit on the amount of rubbish it can throw away has sparked intense debate in recent years. While some argue that such a measure is essential for mitigating environmental degradation, others contend that it infringes upon individual freedoms. In my opinion, I partially agree with the idea of imposing rubbish limits, as it can have numerous benefits for the environment and public health.On the one hand, imposing limits on rubbish can significantly reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills, which are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. For instance, countries like Japan and Sweden have successfully implemented waste management systems that emphasize recycling and composting, resulting in a substantial decrease in landfill waste. By setting limits, households would be encouraged to adopt more sustainable practices, such as reducing, reusing, and recycling, ultimately contributing to a cleaner and healthier environment.On the other hand, imposing strict limits on rubbish may not be a practical or effective solution for all households. Low-income families or those with large families may struggle with limited waste disposal options, and may even resort to illegal dumping. Moreover, implementing and enforcing such a system would require significant investment in waste management infrastructure and education, which could be costly and time-consuming.In conclusion, while I agree that imposing limits on rubbish can have environmental benefits, I believe that a more nuanced approach is necessary. Governments should focus on educating the public about sustainable waste management practices and providing accessible recycling facilities, rather than imposing strict limits. By promoting a culture of sustainability and providing support, households can be encouraged to reduce their waste without feeling unduly restricted. Ultimately, a balanced approach that takes into account the needs and capabilities of different households is essential for creating an effective and fair waste management system.
1406;Every year an increasing number of students choose to go to another country for their higher education. Do you think the benefits of this development outweigh the problems associated with it?;The past twenty years have seen a dramatic change the number of students who go abroad . In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of this trend.On the one hand, both students and their country can benefit from this trend. First, students can choose more suitable methods for themselves because there are more options. The and teaching methods are quite different . According to foreign experts, Secondly, people can improve their foreign language, they can contact with when they are in a foreign country, and they quickly master the foreign language. Thirdly, it helps to promote the mutual understanding between their mother land and their destination countries. These students exchange information with the locals. Students can get better understanding of the countries. People in their home country will get more vivid information about other countries . Similarly, the locals also can get more clear recognition about other countries.On the other hand, there are disadvantages too. Firstly, it costs people a lot of money to begin college in foreign countries. Many families have to take out all their savings to support their children abroad. Secondly, some students cannot stand the big difference the new environment, they quit their study and come back home.To conclude, given the fact that in foreign countries helps students with their studies and promotes the mutual understanding countries, even if there are some drawbacks, I think the benefits outweigh the problems.;The trend of students pursuing higher education in foreign countries has been on the rise in recent years. This phenomenon has sparked a debate about whether the advantages of studying abroad outweigh the drawbacks. In my opinion, the benefits of this development far surpass the problems associated with it.On the one hand, the benefits of studying abroad are numerous. For instance, it provides students with a unique opportunity to immerse themselves in a new culture, learn a new language, and gain a distinctive perspective on life. This, in turn, broadens their horizons, fosters independence, and enhances their career prospects. Moreover, many foreign universities offer world-class education, state-of-the-art facilities, and renowned faculty, which can be a major draw for students seeking high-quality education.On the other hand, there are some problems associated with studying abroad, such as homesickness, cultural shock, and financial burdens. However, these challenges can be mitigated with proper planning, preparation, and support from family and friends. Furthermore, many universities offer scholarships, grants, and other forms of financial aid to international students, which can help alleviate some of the financial pressures.In conclusion, while there are some problems associated with studying abroad, I firmly believe that the benefits of this development outweigh the drawbacks. The experience and knowledge gained from studying in a foreign country can be invaluable, and can open up a wide range of opportunities for students in their future careers. As such, I think that students should be encouraged to pursue higher education in foreign countries, as it can be a life-changing experience that can have a profound impact on their personal and professional growth.
1305;Everybody today should pay a small amount from their income in order to help people who are homeless and / or suffering great poverty. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Homelessness and poverty is a terrible but topical issue in both more economically advanced and less industrialised countries. To deal with this, many people feel that a small proportion of everyone’s income should be used to aid the homeless and poor. This could create more opportunities and change the lives of many disadvantaged people for the better.Though there are certain facilities such as shelters and soup kitchens to aid the poor and homeless, it is clear that this is not enough. In the U.S. alone, a very developed country in itself, nearly two million people are homeless. These facilities can lend a helpful hand; however, they do not help eradicate the problem. Those people who are homeless or poor can have trouble finding jobs, or, if they are lucky to gain employment, the pay may not be enough to support them and their families.If a small percentage of everyone’s income was used to help build more aid facilities and fund organisations to help the homeless and poor, the suffering of many people could be alleviated. However, this is not a perfect world, and taxes are high enough for many people. A similar argument could be that a portion of the taxes already paid to the government should then be set aside for this cause, but of course government funds are usually stretched to breaking point as it is, as governments have so many financial responsibilities already.Though the fundamental idea that people should pay a small percentage of their income to help the homeless and poor is admirable, it is unlikely that enough people would agree to it. People need all the money they earn after taxes anyway and, although governments already have too many calls on their available funds, in my view they should prioritise support payments for the homeless.";"The notion that everybody should contribute a small portion of their income to support individuals struggling with homelessness and extreme poverty has sparked a heated debate. In my opinion, I largely agree with this proposition. By implementing a small, yet mandatory contribution from each individual's income, the collective efforts could substantially alleviate the plight of those in dire need.Firstly, a small deduction from one's income is a negligible sacrifice compared to the significant positive impact it could have on the lives of homeless individuals and those living in extreme poverty. For instance, the funds collected could be utilized to establish and maintain shelters, provide food, clothing, and offer rehabilitation programs. These initiatives would not only provide immediate relief but also empower individuals to regain their dignity and become self-sufficient.Moreover, such a system would promote a sense of community and social responsibility among citizens. When everyone contributes, even if it's a small amount, it fosters a collective commitment to addressing societal issues. This shared responsibility could also encourage volunteerism and community engagement, as people become more aware and invested in the welfare of their fellow citizens. For example, the city of Helsinki in Finland has successfully implemented a ""Housing First"" approach, which prioritizes providing permanent housing to homeless individuals before addressing other issues. This model has shown remarkable success in reducing homelessness, demonstrating the potential of well-planned and adequately funded initiatives.However, it is crucial to ensure that the collected funds are managed efficiently and effectively. Transparency and accountability in the distribution and utilization of these contributions are essential to maintain public trust and maximize the impact of this initiative. Furthermore, addressing the root causes of homelessness and poverty, such as lack of affordable housing, unemployment, and mental health issues, should remain a priority alongside providing immediate support.In conclusion, while there are logistical and administrative challenges to consider, the benefits of a collective, small-scale financial contribution from the general public to support homeless and severely impoverished individuals far outweigh the drawbacks. It is not only a moral obligation but also a pragmatic approach to fostering a more equitable and compassionate society. By sharing the burden, we can ensure that no one is left behind in our pursuit of prosperity and well-being."
1407;Financial education should be a mandatory component of the school program. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;In many countries the discussion about financial education getting more serious due to financial problems of young generation. Some people that financial education should be considered a mandatory subject at school.The common problem for those young people is that they don’t know how to spend money in right way. As we can see many advertisements often carry out the message, “Only 10 dollars a week, no deposits” which is misleading think that living in debt is normal. Financial education is one of the solutions for . The basic idea of financial education as a core school subject is to teach those young ones to understand the concept of using money and to estimate a risk of borrowing money to buy something in the future.However, another factor we need . In my opinion, the role of financial education is getting more important and it should be a part of the school program but the parents are also important and have responsibility to how to manage the money. More than 70% of young people’s money is from their parents. In addition, it has to be considered that a student might become person, talking about money all the time in class or even in a public place. It can be harmful for some students and affect their normal social life.In conclusion, I that financial education will have a positive effect on all young ones and other such social commutations should be considered just as important as financial education.;I strongly agree that financial education should be a mandatory component of the school program. In today's complex and ever-changing financial landscape, it is essential that students are equipped with the knowledge and skills to manage their finances effectively. Financial literacy is a crucial life skill that can have a significant impact on an individual's economic stability and security.Without proper financial education, many young people are left to navigate the world of personal finance on their own, often with disastrous consequences. They may accumulate debt, make poor investment decisions, and struggle to achieve long-term financial goals. By incorporating financial education into the school curriculum, students can learn vital skills such as budgeting, saving, and investing, as well as how to avoid common financial pitfalls.Moreover, financial education can have a positive impact on societal well-being. Individuals who are financially literate are more likely to make informed decisions about their money, reducing the risk of financial crisis and dependence on government support. Furthermore, financial education can promote entrepreneurship, innovation, and economic growth, as students are empowered to make smart financial decisions and take calculated risks.While some may argue that financial education is not a traditional academic subject, I firmly believe that it is a vital component of a well-rounded education. By making financial education mandatory, schools can provide students with a comprehensive education that prepares them for success in all aspects of life. In conclusion, I strongly agree that financial education should be a mandatory component of the school program, as it is essential for promoting financial literacy, economic stability, and societal well-being. By teaching students the skills and knowledge they need to manage their finances effectively, we can empower them to make informed decisions and achieve long-term financial success.
1404;Full time university students spend most of the time studying. They should be doing other activities too. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Full time study in university is a great experience in life but in parallel to that students other activities such as working for their pocket money, sports, participating in debates and . People differ in their opinion if students must in other things or stay concentrated on their studies only. The discussion will be presented below, followed by my opinion.Some people say that mere studying does not youth for a country. This way, students only earn theoretical knowledge not practical. For instance, students can be their studies but at the same time when they , they fail and cannot develop their confidence and work as brilliantly as they were in university. Hence, the best approach for them to be engaged here and there for practical experience.On the other hand, others believe that building a better career is the foremost thing in today’s world. So, they are targeted to their studies and gain as much knowledge as they can. Furthermore, if they are diverted from their studies, they will not be able to their .In my point of view, there must be blending of full time education and extra activities. It refreshes students’ minds and provides more energy . Moreover, by this way, they will learn how to with other people in the society.To summarize, it can be said that it is important to concentrate on but on the other hand there must be something to keep active and relaxed being involved in games, music, work and other extra activities.;The notion that full-time university students should spend most of their time studying is a common belief, but I partially disagree with this statement. While it is true that academic pursuits are the primary focus of university life, I believe that students should also engage in other activities to maintain a healthy balance and foster overall development.On the one hand, studying is undoubtedly a crucial aspect of university life, and students should allocate sufficient time to attend classes, lectures, and work on assignments. Academic success is often a top priority, and dedicating a significant amount of time to studying is necessary to achieve good grades and meet the expectations of professors and parents. Moreover, the university years are a critical period for knowledge acquisition, skill development, and intellectual growth, making studying a vital component of the university experience.On the other hand, I firmly believe that engaging in other activities is essential for students' physical, emotional, and social well-being. Participating in extracurricular activities, such as sports, clubs, or volunteer work, can help students develop valuable life skills, like teamwork, communication, and time management. Additionally, these activities provide opportunities for socialization, networking, and stress relief, all of which are essential for maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Furthermore, exploring hobbies and interests outside of academia can foster creativity, innovation, and personal growth, ultimately enhancing students' overall university experience.In conclusion, while studying is a fundamental aspect of university life, I believe that students should also prioritize other activities to ensure a well-rounded and fulfilling experience. By striking a balance between academic pursuits and other interests, students can optimize their university years, achieve academic success, and develop into capable, confident, and well-adjusted individuals.
1293;Having a salaried job is better than being self-employed. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;If one wants to work for money, there are really only two options, working for someone else for a salary and being self-employed. Most people are involved with these two options and they both have advantages and disadvantages.Being self-employed means that the worker owns the business that is being done. This might be a small one-person business or a large company with hundreds of employees. The first advantage of this is the capacity to earn more money. If the business does very well, the income can be considerable and the owner of the company will receive the benefits. On the other hand, if business is not good, the owner’s income will be low. Self-employed people also have the benefit to some extent of choosing their working hours and holidays and they have the right to change anything within their business. With this autonomy, however, comes the pressure to succeed and the reliance on one’s employees, if there are any, to do their best to make the business thrive.Salaried workers do not experience the same stress as the self-employed owners of companies. They might have stress in their duties, but the pressure that comes with keeping one’s own business operating successfully in order to support oneself and one’s family is just not felt by an employee. The employee also has a certain knowledge of his or her income, as the salary is usually fixed every month. The self-employed owner’s income often depends on how successful the business is. The employee’s fixed income, however, does not give much scope for earning large amounts more. In addition, an employee does not have the freedoms of the owner or the autonomy, and for many people, having control over their lives is a significant factor to their well-being.It is certain that there are advantages and disadvantages for both being self-employed and salaried. I personally disagree that being salaried is better than being self-employed. I prefer the autonomy that being self-employed brings and, although there is more risk and pressure, this can lead to greater and more fulfilling rewards.;The notion that having a salaried job is better than being self-employed is a topic of ongoing debate. While some argue that the security and stability offered by a salaried position make it the more desirable option, others contend that the freedom and potential for unlimited earnings associated with self-employment far outweigh the benefits of a traditional job. In my opinion, I partially agree with the statement, as both salaried jobs and self-employment have their unique advantages and disadvantages.On the one hand, having a salaried job provides a sense of security and stability, which is often lacking in self-employment. A salaried job typically comes with a fixed income, benefits, and paid time off, which can be incredibly valuable for individuals who prioritize predictability and comfort. For example, a person with a family to support may prefer the stability of a salaried job to ensure they can consistently provide for their loved ones. Additionally, salaried jobs often offer opportunities for career advancement, training, and networking, which can be beneficial for long-term professional growth.On the other hand, being self-employed offers a level of autonomy and flexibility that is difficult to find in traditional employment. Self-employed individuals have the freedom to pursue their passions, set their own schedules, and potentially earn unlimited income. Many successful entrepreneurs, such as Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg, started their own businesses and achieved immense success. Moreover, self-employment can provide a sense of fulfillment and personal satisfaction that may not be attainable in a salaried job.In conclusion, whether having a salaried job is better than being self-employed depends on individual circumstances, priorities, and goals. While salaried jobs offer security and stability, self-employment provides autonomy and potential for unlimited earnings. Ultimately, the choice between these two options should be based on personal preferences and what aligns best with one's values and aspirations.
1339;High-rise vs. low-rise buildings, which solution is better for a growing population?;Some cities create new housing for their growing populations by constructing a smaller number of high-rise buildings. Other cities create more of low-rise buildings. Which solution is better, in your opinion?Sample EssayRising population in urban areas leaves governments with no choice but to build more houses to meet the demand. However, when it comes to construction, there is more than one way to build new homes. Some cities prefer to construct fewer residential towers, while others build a larger number of low-rises for their residents. In this essay both options will be discussed and a viable solution will be suggested.One advantage of tall buildings is that they can accommodate a large number of people while having a small footprint. This type of construction is popular in central city areas where land is scarce and expensive. For example, in New York City high-rise buildings have significantly reduced housing problems, by as much as 55% in the last few years. As a result of this strategy, rents tend to decrease which has a further positive impact on the economies of such cities. However, tall buildings offer little or no privacy, they force certain rules and regulations upon residents, and attract higher maintenance costs.Given a chance to voice their opinion, many individuals would prefer to live in low-rise buildings or even build their own houses. This option might be more attractive for big families and for older generation people who like to have their own personal space. Accessibility is also a concern for the elderly as taking the stairs when the lifts break down may not be an option for them. In addition, one or two-story houses are easier and cheaper to maintain compared to modern apartment towers. The downside of this type of dwellings is that they occupy much more land, and since land is cheaper on city fringes, new estates tend to be built away from city centres. This increases commute time to work for their residents and negatively affects their quality of life.In conclusion, high-rise and low-rise buildings have their unique advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, high rises are more suitable for younger residents and should be built in the areas where young population is prevalent, closer to the city centre and employment opportunities. Senior citizens should have a supply of lower dwellings available in quieter locations. Such flexible approach can be a good way to address the needs of growing city’s population.;As the global population continues to grow, the need for efficient and sustainable urban planning has become increasingly important. One of the key debates in this context is whether high-rise or low-rise buildings are the better solution for accommodating a growing population. While both options have their advantages and disadvantages, I believe that high-rise buildings are the more suitable solution.High-rise buildings offer a number of benefits, including increased density and reduced land usage. By building upwards, cities can accommodate more people without sacrificing green spaces or encroaching on surrounding ecosystems. Additionally, high-rise buildings can be designed to be more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly, with features such as green roofs, solar panels, and advanced insulation. This not only reduces the carbon footprint of the building but also helps to mitigate the urban heat island effect.In contrast, low-rise buildings often require more land to accommodate the same number of people, which can lead to urban sprawl and the destruction of natural habitats. Furthermore, low-rise buildings tend to be less energy-efficient, as they have a larger surface area exposed to the elements, resulting in higher heating and cooling costs.However, it is also important to consider the social and economic implications of high-rise buildings. For example, high-rise buildings can be designed to include community facilities, such as parks, schools, and healthcare centers, which can help to foster a sense of community and social cohesion. Moreover, high-rise buildings can provide a range of housing options, from affordable apartments to luxury penthouses, which can help to promote social mobility and economic diversity.In conclusion, while low-rise buildings have their advantages, I believe that high-rise buildings are the better solution for a growing population. By building upwards, cities can accommodate more people while minimizing the impact on the environment and promoting social and economic diversity.
1365;IELTS Essay, topic: Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between the rich and poor, while others disagree (discuss);Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between rich and poor people, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.There is no doubt that modern technology is reshaping our planet and affecting every aspect of human lives. From a social perspective, many people argue that the gap between the upper class and lower classes is widening as a result of technological advancements. Others, however, believe the opposite.There are several reasons why one could think that the wealth inequality is, indeed, increasing. The most common reason is automation. Driven by technology, automation reduces the need for manual labour. As a result, less work opportunities are available for unskilled people. With each iteration of the cycle the competition increases and wages decrease. , technology has increased the minimum level of needs that should be satisfied. Nowadays, everybody should have a mobile phone and an internet connection, including the poor. This increases the monetary burden on them as they must borrow to cover these new needs.However, I firmly believe that the aforementioned opinion is ludicrous. The most obvious reason is that modern technology has facilitated the road to riches in an unprecedented manner. For instance, many of the internet billionaires are from lower and middle classes. Moreover, the major leaps in agricultural technologies magnified food production. As a result, food has become more affordable and available. Finally, leveraging technology has dramatically increased workers’ productivity. Consequently, compensations and salaries have increased.In conclusion, I strongly believe that technology could possibly narrow the difference between social classes. Increased food production, opportunities and productivity are just few examples of technology’s contribution to bridging the wealth gap.This essay adequately covers all parts of the task. The ideas expressed in this written response are relevant, well-developed, ordered in a logical way and supported. The paragraphing is suitable and cohesion is maintained throughout the essay. A good range of vocabulary and the writer’s fluency are evident. There are no spelling errors and very few mistakes in word choice and grammar, most sentences are error-free. The essay is likely to get Band 8 in IELTS.;The advent of modern technology has sparked a heated debate about its impact on socioeconomic inequality. On the one hand, some argue that technology is exacerbating the gap between the rich and poor, while on the other hand, others disagree, citing the potential benefits of technology in bridging this divide.Those who believe that modern technology is widening the gap between the rich and poor point to the fact that access to cutting-edge technology is often limited to affluent individuals and companies. The high cost of innovative technologies, such as artificial intelligence and robotics, means that only large corporations and wealthy individuals can afford to invest in them. This creates a situation where the rich have access to powerful tools that enable them to accumulate even more wealth, while the poor are left behind, struggling to make ends meet. Furthermore, the automation of jobs through technology has led to significant job losses, particularly in industries where low-skilled workers are employed, thereby increasing poverty and inequality.On the other hand, others argue that modern technology has the potential to reduce the gap between the rich and poor. For instance, the widespread availability of smartphones and the internet has enabled people from all walks of life to access information, education, and job opportunities that were previously out of reach. Online platforms have also created new avenues for entrepreneurship and innovation, allowing individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds to start their own businesses and compete with larger companies. Additionally, digital payment systems and mobile banking have increased financial inclusion, enabling the poor to access financial services and manage their finances more effectively.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, it is clear that modern technology has the potential to both widen and bridge the gap between the rich and poor. Ultimately, the impact of technology on socioeconomic inequality will depend on how it is harnessed and distributed. Governments and corporations must work together to ensure that the benefits of technology are shared equitably and that measures are put in place to mitigate its negative consequences.
1388;In many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?;Nowadays, many children involved in different types of jobs to have some kind of financial assurance for themselves. However, whether this is good for their development and personality is a controversial issue. I personally believe that paid works is harmful for children for several reasons.It is said that children gain valuable experience in the work place. This may be true. However, I would argue that children are mainly employed in jobs that require manual work and are poorly paid. The recent statistics reveal the common tasks that children are assigned to are washing dishes, mopping floors or serving food in restaurants. Meanwhile, this kind of jobs actually provide children with necessary and useful skills to apply in their future .This brings me to the second point. Defenders of child labour that it is an effective method of learning. The point is children should be able to apply knowledge taught to them in a real life working environment. Although this is undoubtedly true, it also means that children may neglect the classroom study and even fail the class. The worst thing is yet to come. They may become so preoccupied with the benefits ahead of them such as small salary that they may leave school.Finally, supporters say that it helps them to build responsibility in the family. They will understand how it is difficult to earn money and therefore have compassion for their parents. This is true to a certain extent, but may have a totally adverse effect on children. As children can make money at an early age, they would feel that it is appropriate to spend it on luxury things.In conclusion, I think that parents should take measures to restrict their child from work, otherwise it would have negative consequences to their future.;The issue of children engaging in paid work is a contentious one, with some people vehemently opposing it and others viewing it as a valuable learning experience. In my opinion, the question of whether children should be allowed to participate in paid work is not a straightforward one. On the one hand, it is undeniable that many children are forced to work due to economic necessity, and in such cases, it is unfair to deny them the opportunity to earn a living. Moreover, some forms of paid work, such as internships or apprenticeships, can provide children with valuable skills and work experience that can benefit them in the long run.On the other hand, I also believe that children should not be allowed to work in jobs that are hazardous, exploitative, or interfere with their education. Children have the right to a childhood, and engaging in paid work should not come at the expense of their physical, emotional, or educational well-being. Furthermore, it is the responsibility of governments and societies to ensure that children are protected from exploitation and that their education and development are prioritized.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the potential benefits of paid work for children, I believe that it is crucial to strike a balance between allowing children to gain valuable work experience and protecting them from exploitation and harm. Children's education, health, and well-being should always be the top priority, and any form of paid work should be carefully regulated and monitored to ensure that it does not compromise these fundamental rights. Ultimately, it is our collective responsibility to ensure that children are able to thrive and reach their full potential, without being forced to sacrifice their childhood for the sake of paid work.
1411;In many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it to be a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion on this?;In the Third World, children are usually sent to factories for laborious work. Many people believe that it is merely exploitation, while others think it is a good opportunity for them to life experience. In any case, children have their right to live and study in peaceful conditions. Therefore, using them as workforce is considered an unacceptable action.First of all, children are not workers. They have just learned about the vast world and do not have any experience or concept of working. Since these innocent children are naive and , they can be easily cheated and exploited. There are many examples of this in poor nations. Because using children is cheap and to control, many enterprises hire them and don’t pay them much. Although the government in these countries has tried its best, this kind of taking advantage of children cannot be eliminated.Moreover, children do not need such thing as ‘valuable work experience’ that is supposedly ‘important for learning and taking responsibility’. The brief responsibility of children is learning. They are not old enough to understand what working experiences are. Nevertheless, they can help parents do chores or housework. This will be a much better way for them to become more responsible for . In addition, childhood is one of the most remarkable memories and must not be taken away by forcing them to work.In conclusion, since all children are the great concern of parent and society, they should be allowed to enjoy life and rather than to work. Hence, one must ponder what view is actually appropriate for the sake of the children.;The engagement of children in paid work is a contentious issue, with opinions divided on its merits. While some people view it as a form of exploitation, others see it as a valuable learning experience. In my opinion, the latter perspective holds more weight, provided that the work is suitable and does not interfere with their education.Engaging in paid work can be a valuable experience for children, teaching them important life skills such as responsibility, time management, and financial literacy. It can also foster a strong work ethic, which is essential for their future careers. Moreover, many children from low-income families rely on paid work to support their families, and prohibiting them from working could exacerbate poverty and inequality.However, it is crucial to ensure that the work is safe, suitable, and does not hinder their education. Children should not be engaged in hazardous or exploitative work, and their working hours should be limited to prevent fatigue and interference with their studies. Governments and regulatory bodies must establish and enforce strict guidelines to protect children from exploitation and ensure their well-being.In conclusion, paid work can be a valuable experience for children, provided that it is regulated and does not compromise their education or well-being. By striking a balance between work and study, children can acquire essential life skills, develop a strong work ethic, and contribute to their families' income, ultimately preparing them for a successful and responsible adulthood. Therefore, I believe that paid work for children can be beneficial, as long as it is properly regulated and prioritizes their education and well-being.
361;In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?;"Money can not buy happiness! Is one of the most famous sayings while talking about finances. It is argued that topics around money, wealth, and poverty are becoming dramatically more frequent between humans in different countries around the world. In my opinion, the extream part of it is a negative development; although, it has some positivities. I will address some of both sides in this essay.Talking about money during the major part of the day might make the person look stingy and this is an attitude that majority of the community would not like, thus, might effect on the person's social life. Moreover, having the same topic in mind all day might lead to an obsession, and as a result, this could lead to a depression because the person might not find the proper way to reach to the financial position that meets their satisfaction, which could lead to depression, or even worse such as going through illegal paths where it could destroy their lives entirely!Nevertheless, the person should be aware of his /her income and spendings and try to enhance their financial position to the best possible way. Also, the inflation that we are currently living and the noticable increase in prices could be a driver for people to talk about money more often.In conclusion, people should not be obssessed in money and to talk with everyone about it all the time. However, I believe that people should discuss this matter in order to benefit from each other, and to find more ways to enhance their quality of life.";The increasing tendency for people to discuss money in their daily conversations has become a prevalent phenomenon in many countries. One reason for this trend is the growing financial pressures and uncertainties that individuals face in their daily lives. With the rising cost of living, the need to make ends meet has become a common concern, prompting people to frequently talk about their earnings, expenses, and financial struggles.Another factor contributing to this trend is the erosion of social taboos surrounding discussions of personal finance. In the past, talking about one's salary or expenditure was considered impolite and intrusive. However, the growing culture of openness and transparency has made it more acceptable for people to share and compare their financial situations.While this development may seem harmless, it can have negative consequences. Excessive focus on money can lead to an unhealthy obsession with material wealth, fostering a sense of competition and envy among individuals. Moreover, it can also create unrealistic expectations and promote consumerism, as people feel pressured to keep up with the spending habits of those around them.In conclusion, the increasing tendency for people to talk about money in their daily conversations is a complex issue with both positive and negative aspects. On the one hand, it reflects the growing need for people to connect and share their financial experiences. On the other hand, it can lead to an unhealthy fixation on material wealth and promote consumerist values. Ultimately, it is essential to strike a balance between openness and discretion when discussing personal finance, to avoid perpetuating a culture of materialism and competition.
671;In many countries women and men are working full time. It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;I strongly agree with this statement. If women and men are both working full time, they should share household works.First of all, if women and men are working full time, and they are working in the same amount of time, logically, the amount of time they do household works should be the sam e. However, if one of them work for longer hours, the household works should still be shared but the other one should do more household works.Second of all, everyone have responsibility to do household works because everyone lives in the house, makes the house dirty, creates dirty clothes and dishes. If there is only either women or men doing household works, it is not fair at all, because they both work full time.But as I mentioned before, the amount of time doing household works can be arranged, it doesn't have to be evenly shared. For instance, if the woman in this family work for longer hours or got an extra call by work, the man should help and do her part of household works. And when the man are working more, the woman should do the same. This does not only solve the problem of who should do household works but can also show that women and men are supporting each other in various situations.In conclusion, when women and men are both doing full time jobs, they should share household works. But it doesn't have to to be split in two halves, it can have alternatives depending on the working hours or special situations. In this way, the house can be more peaceful and have more harmony without arguments about who should do the household works.;The notion that women and men should share household responsibilities has gained significant traction in recent years, particularly in societies where both partners work full-time. I strongly agree with this perspective, as it not only promotes equality but also acknowledges the changing dynamics of modern families.In contemporary society, where women and men often share equal financial responsibilities, it is only fair that they also divide domestic duties. This division of labor can help alleviate the burden on women, who have traditionally borne the brunt of household chores. By sharing these responsibilities, couples can create a more balanced and equitable relationship, where both partners have equal time for leisure, personal development, and career advancement.Moreover, sharing household work can also have a positive impact on family dynamics and relationships. When both partners contribute equally to household chores, it fosters a sense of teamwork, cooperation, and mutual respect. Children in such households are also more likely to grow up with a healthy understanding of gender roles and responsibilities, breaking the cycle of traditional stereotypes.However, it is also important to recognize that the division of household work may not always be straightforward or equal. Different individuals may have different capabilities, preferences, or work schedules that could affect their ability to contribute equally to household chores. Therefore, communication and flexibility are key to finding a balance that works for both partners.In conclusion, given the evolving nature of work and family structures, it is logical and fair for women and men to share household responsibilities. This sharing not only reflects the changing roles of men and women in society but also contributes to a more balanced, respectful, and equitable relationship between partners. Ultimately, a balanced distribution of household work can lead to stronger, more harmonious families and a more progressive society.
1343;In many countries young people start living on their own after high school, is this a positive or negative development?;In many countries around the world young people decide to leave their parents’ home once they finish school. They start living on their own or sharing a house with friends. Is this a positive or a negative development? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples.Sample EssayNowadays it is becoming increasingly common for youngsters to start their independent life by moving out of their parents’ home after graduation from school. This trend has positive effects on the society and the reasons behind it will be discussed next in this essay.There are various benefits for both young people and their parents when individuals start living independently after finishing school. Young adults, in this way, have to take care of their daily needs, from house chores, cooking or cleaning to financial independence. Thus, instead of wasting time on childish activities, they are motivated to learn skills and work part-time or full-time in order to cover their living expenses. Although it might seem challenging for them to live on their own at first, it would give them valuable experience, helping them to become mature, responsible adults. Parents would also be pleased with this practice since they can enjoy their own lives by having more time for themselves. Not only would they have more financial flexibility due to independence of their children, but they also don’t have to change their habits in order to adapt to the new generation’s lifestyle. For instance, it allows many people to travel around the world, which would be impossible if their children were to stay with them after finishing high school.Admittedly, there might be some challenges involved in this way of life. In some cases and especially under the influence of new friends or housemates, youngsters might choose to get involved in dangerous activities that involve drugs or petty crimes. However, instead of keeping their children close through adulthood, parents should prepare in advance and raise their children to distinguish between right and wrong and teach them to take responsibility for their actions.In conclusion, although there might be some adverse consequences to this relatively new practice, I believe that the advantages of young people leaving family home outweigh its drawbacks, for both children and parents.;The trend of young people moving out of their family homes after completing high school is a widespread phenomenon in many countries. This development has sparked intense debate, with some viewing it as a positive step towards independence and others seeing it as a negative move that can have adverse consequences.On the positive side, living on their own after high school can be a valuable learning experience for young people. It teaches them important life skills such as time management, financial planning, and self-reliance. By living independently, young people are forced to take responsibility for their own lives, making decisions about their daily routines, budgets, and goals. This autonomy can foster a sense of maturity and self-confidence, which are essential for success in their future careers and personal lives.However, there are also negative aspects to consider. Living on their own at a young age can be overwhelming for some, leading to stress and anxiety. Financially, it can be a significant burden, as young people may struggle to balance the costs of living, education, and other expenses on their own. Moreover, without the guidance and support of their families, young people may be more susceptible to negative influences and risky behaviors.In conclusion, whether young people living on their own after high school is a positive or negative development depends on individual circumstances and the level of support available to them. While it can be a valuable learning experience that promotes independence and responsibility, it also poses significant challenges. Ultimately, a balanced approach that combines autonomy with ongoing support and guidance from family and community is likely the most beneficial for young people transitioning into independent adulthood.
1320;In many countries, a lot of food is wasted. Why do people waste food? How can we reduce the amount of food waste?;"Despite the fact that millions of people in the world go hungry every day, a surprisingly large amount of food gets wasted daily in certain parts of the world. In my opinion, the main reason for this is that people in the first-world countries tend to only buy food that is aesthetically pleasing, and fortunately, there are some ways to tackle this issue.It is shockingly sad to know that large amounts of perfectly edible food in the form of fresh produce get sent to landfills, and the main reason for this is that these foods do not meet the standards of perfection set for fruits and vegetables by consumers and grocery stores. For example, veggies and fruit that are misshapen or have a few spots on them are still good enough to eat, yet they are often left on shelves to rot in favour of something that looks less damaged. In addition, a lot of customers confuse the ‘best by’ and ‘use by’ dates, thinking that foods that have passed their ‘best by’ dates are no longer fit to eat. Another major reason for food wastage is that people often overestimate the amount of produce they require on a weekly or monthly basis, and most of it ends up getting thrown out instead of being used.There are many ways to reduce the amount of food being wasted, and I think one of the best ideas is to increase people’s awareness of just how much good food is disposed of, only because of our superficial biases as to how food should look. Raising the awareness of the staggering number of people that go hungry in third-world countries would make it harder to throw away an apple just because it is a little bruised. Also, teaching people how to better plan their monthly food requirements would help them not to overspend on food that they do not need; it would be great for the environment and their budget. The role of the government in this endeavour is indispensable as such task would be too great for any smaller organisation.To conclude, the wasting food is a serious issue that merits increased awareness from both people and the leaders of the world. It is unacceptable to discard any food when there are so many people who are starving, and hopefully our joint effort can help improve the current situation.";The issue of food waste has become a significant concern in many countries around the world. It is estimated that a substantial amount of food is wasted every year, which is not only economically inefficient but also environmentally harmful. There are several reasons why people waste food. One of the main reasons is overbuying, where individuals purchase more food than they can consume before it spoils. Additionally, lack of planning and improper storage of food can also lead to waste. Furthermore, people often throw away food that is still edible, simply because it does not meet their cosmetic standards.To reduce the amount of food waste, several steps can be taken. Firstly, individuals can plan their meals and make a shopping list to avoid overbuying. Moreover, storing food properly and using up leftovers can also minimize waste. Governments and businesses can also play a crucial role in reducing food waste. For instance, they can launch public awareness campaigns to educate people about the importance of reducing food waste. Moreover, they can implement policies and practices that encourage the redistribution of surplus food to those in need. Another effective way to reduce food waste is through composting, where food waste is converted into nutrient-rich soil that can be used in agriculture.In conclusion, food waste is a significant problem that requires immediate attention. By understanding the reasons behind food waste and implementing effective strategies to reduce it, we can minimize the economic and environmental impacts of food waste. Individuals, governments, and businesses must work together to address this issue and create a more sustainable food system. By taking small steps, such as planning meals, storing food properly, and composting, we can make a significant difference and reduce the amount of food waste in our communities.
1331;In many countries, young people are finding it harder and harder to find permanent jobs. Why is this happening? What can be done to improve the situation?;In this fast-moving age, with the development of education and modern technologies, people strive to have a secure job after graduating from colleges and universities. Despite their efforts, so many young adults in different parts of the world have a negative experience of finding a long-term job.It so happens that most colleges and universities focus on students’ academic performance much more than their practical skills. Unfortunately, many companies reserve permanent job opportunities for experienced applicants because there is no need to invest much in their training. Lack of practical experience in new graduates puts them at a disadvantage as far as companies are concerned. The situation is made worse by the abundance of advanced technologies that can easily replace human labor. Robots and computers work more efficiently and with higher precision than humans. That shrinks the pool of available job placements even more, as companies only need to hire highly educated and experienced staff.Fortunately, there is a number of solutions that can help inexperienced workers gain permanent employment. An obvious one is that universities could offer internships to their students, or arrange workshops in addition to classwork. This would help students to get training and experience in their respective fields. Also, the government could examine the demands of changing labor market and steer young people towards professions that will be popular in the coming years. Together with colleges and universities the government could create special awareness programs for graduates, providing them with an overview of various job offers and their benefits. This way students would be able to choose the right jobs for themselves.To sum up, lack of demand in the labour market and insufficient experience are two major reasons why many young people have trouble finding a permanent position. Helping them gain hands-on experience as part of their studies and educating them about career options early on is key to improving the employment outcome for them.;The struggle of young people to find permanent jobs is a pressing issue in many countries. One of the primary reasons for this phenomenon is the shift in the global economy, which has led to an increase in temporary and contract work. Many companies are now opting for flexible employment arrangements, allowing them to adapt quickly to changing market conditions. As a result, young people are often forced to accept short-term or freelance work, which lacks the stability and security of permanent employment.Another factor contributing to this trend is the rise of automation and technological advancements. Machines and artificial intelligence are increasingly replacing human workers, particularly in sectors such as manufacturing and customer service. This has reduced the number of available permanent positions, particularly for young people who are just entering the workforce. Furthermore, the high cost of hiring and training new employees can also deter companies from offering permanent contracts.To improve the situation, governments, educational institutions, and businesses must work together to provide young people with the skills and opportunities they need to succeed. Vocational training programs and apprenticeships can help equip young people with the skills required by the modern job market. Additionally, companies can offer more permanent positions by investing in their employees and providing a stable work environment. Governments can also implement policies that incentivize businesses to hire young people on a permanent basis, such as tax breaks or subsidies. By addressing the root causes of this issue and working collaboratively, we can create a more supportive and stable job market for young people, allowing them to build secure and successful careers.
1318;In many workplaces online communication has overtaken face to face meetings. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?;In today’s ever-increasingly digital world, online communication has become the norm for many workplaces. While this development offers numerous advantages for companies such as greater flexibility and efficiency, it also brings with it certain disadvantages like miscommunication, which must be weighed against its benefits.One of the primary advantages of online communication is that it makes it easier for teams to stay in touch without having to physically convene. This is especially beneficial when individuals or groups are dispersed across vast distances. Reduced travel costs, as well as time saved from not having to travel to and from meetings, also represent meaningful savings for businesses. Additionally, online communication platforms often have a range of features designed to make collaboration more efficient, such as providing an easy way to share documents and other materials with remote team members. To illustrate, digital resources can be sent quickly and securely via email or other software services like Dropbox or Google Drive.There is a potential drawback associated with relying too heavily on online communication at work, as the lack of physical proximity between members of a team can often lead to misunderstandings due to a loss of context or nonverbal cues that would otherwise be present during face-to-face meetings. However, in my opinion, issues of this nature can be solved by using written language more carefully to avoid any confusion or miscommunication among colleagues.In conclusion, when online communication tools are used properly, they undoubtedly provide companies with greater flexibility in how their teams collaborate without sacrificing clarity of communication, quality or efficiency.;The rise of online communication in the workplace has led to a significant shift away from traditional face-to-face meetings. While this development has its advantages, it also has several disadvantages. In my opinion, the advantages of online communication outweigh the disadvantages, but only to a certain extent.On the one hand, online communication offers numerous benefits, including increased flexibility, reduced travel time, and enhanced global connectivity. With the advent of video conferencing tools, teams can collaborate effortlessly across different time zones and geographical locations. This has opened up new avenues for international business and remote work opportunities. Additionally, online communication enables swift and efficient information exchange, allowing for faster decision-making and improved productivity.On the other hand, the over-reliance on online communication can lead to a lack of personal interaction, which is essential for building trust, resolving conflicts, and fostering creative ideas. Face-to-face meetings facilitate non-verbal cues, such as body language and tone of voice, which are often lost in digital communication. Furthermore, online communication can also lead to distractions, technical issues, and miscommunications, which can hinder effective collaboration.However, the benefits of online communication, particularly in terms of flexibility and global connectivity, outweigh the drawbacks. With the increasing demand for remote work and digital collaboration, online communication has become an indispensable tool for modern workplaces. Nevertheless, it is crucial to strike a balance between online and face-to-face communication to maximize the advantages while minimizing the disadvantages. By doing so, businesses can harness the power of online communication while preserving the value of personal interaction. In conclusion, while online communication has its drawbacks, its benefits make it an essential component of modern workplace communication.
713;In many workplaces, online communication is getting more common than meeting face to face. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?;According to COVID-19 event forced many company to change their way of working. One of the most significant transformation is the communication. The online communication becomes a must or inevitable for the company to be implemented. In this topic, we're going to disscuss the advantages and disadvantages for both ways of communications. The online meeting can introduce a significant impact to the organization while face to face meeting can be outdated for this new era of 2021.First of all for the online communication's advantages is that in the pandemic period the actual physical contact is a significant way to transmit the disease. Video conference can help mitigate this problem by lower the physical contact for each conversation or meeting. Also communicates through online channel can help individual to organize or manage their time efficiently according to each person preference. For example, a single mom parent may be able to spend times for her sons/daughters at home, while be able to have a cross country meeting with another department in other region. Another reason is that some people are quite introvert and find it difficult for face to face human interactions or conversations, in which online chat or messages can help them to mitigate this problem and communicate efficiently. Lastly as mentioned about video conference across region, online meeting can help the multi-national corporates save the transporations cost and additional resources needed to spend for face to face meeting.For the disadvantages, all of the online communications required hardware, internet connection and technological knowledge on how to use them. This technological gap can be seen as one of the most significant obstracle or disadvantage for people to use online communications. For example, in one company, there obviously have a various age of people, in which some of them are not familiar with the technology. Since video call conference has been introduced and utilized widespread among corporates not so long time ago. This can be a big technological gap for some people to use the online communications and result in a lost in communications among the workplaces.As a result, online communication helps an organization to reduce the risk of transmitting the disease, improved the time mangement ability and productivity for each individuals, and lower the financial cost or resources required to spends for international business activities. With all these advantages of online communication stated, they can be seens as a significant reasons to outweight the disadvantages of technological gap on this current year of 2021.;The shift towards online communication in workplaces has become increasingly prevalent. While some argue that this trend has numerous benefits, others claim that it has several drawbacks. In this essay, I will examine both the advantages and disadvantages of online communication in the workplace and argue that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.On the one hand, online communication offers several advantages. Firstly, it enhances flexibility and convenience, as employees can communicate with each other and respond to messages at any time and from any location. This is particularly beneficial for teams with members in different time zones or those who work remotely. Additionally, online communication reduces the need for lengthy meetings, allowing employees to focus on their tasks and increasing productivity.On the other hand, there are some disadvantages to online communication. For instance, it can lead to miscommunication and misunderstandings, as non-verbal cues and tone of voice are often lost in digital messages. Furthermore, online communication can also lead to social isolation and decreased team cohesion, as employees miss out on face-to-face interactions and human connections.However, I believe that the advantages of online communication outweigh the disadvantages. With the advancement of technology, online communication tools have become more sophisticated, allowing for video conferencing and screen sharing, which can help to mitigate the issues of miscommunication and social isolation. Moreover, online communication has become an essential tool for businesses to stay competitive in a globalized market, where teams are often dispersed across different countries and time zones. In conclusion, the benefits of online communication, including increased flexibility and productivity, outweigh the drawbacks, making it an indispensable tool in modern workplaces.
1265;In recent years, the family structure has changed, as well as family roles. What are the changes occurring? Do you think these changes are positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In our modern days, families had witnessed a considerable change regarding their structure and the roles of individuals inside it. These changes are mainly the patriarchal structure that was dominating families in the past compared to a more balanced arrangement nowadays. In addition to that, there are more freedom and rights for women in recent years. And I believe its an advantageous development.Fathers used to be the only leaders of the families of past decades, however in recent days mothers had shared the leadership and started taking part in family decisions just like their partners. Also during recent decades women obtained greater deal of their civil rights which allowed them to take different roles from those that were common for females in the past decades. As an example, women can now own the family house, sign important documents, drive cars which were a breakthrough for women to be able to participate in family plannings and decisions.It appears to be an advantage to have women being able to be effective members of their families, that is because they can share responsibility, add their feminine qualities to the lives of their families as well as for them to be able to fulfill their own life by feeling the importance of their existence and their roles.As in a recent research that found families with women in them are happier, more content, and definitely healthier.In conclusion, the family system nowadays differs vastly from before, owing to the more roles that women are taking, and to the more rights and freedom they gained, and in my perspective it is a positive change.;The traditional family structure has undergone significant changes in recent years, leading to a shift in family roles. One of the most notable changes is the increase in single-parent households and blended families. With more women pursuing careers and becoming financially independent, the role of the male breadwinner has become less dominant. Additionally, the rise of same-sex marriages and families has further diversified the concept of a traditional family.In my opinion, these changes are largely positive. They reflect a more equal and flexible society, where individuals are free to make choices about their lives and relationships. For example, single mothers are no longer stigmatized and are able to raise successful and well-adjusted children. Moreover, the increase in dual-income households has enabled families to enjoy a higher standard of living and provide better opportunities for their children.Another positive aspect of these changes is the redefinition of traditional gender roles. Men are now more involved in childcare and household chores, while women are pursuing careers and taking on more leadership roles. This shift has led to a more balanced and equitable distribution of responsibilities within the family. However, some may argue that these changes have led to a breakdown in family values and stability. Nevertheless, I believe that the benefits of a more flexible and inclusive family structure outweigh the potential drawbacks.In conclusion, the changes in family structure and roles are a natural response to the evolving needs and values of society. While there may be some challenges associated with these changes, I believe that they are ultimately positive and reflect a more equal, flexible, and inclusive society. As families continue to evolve, it is essential to recognize and support the diversity of family structures and roles, and to provide resources and services that cater to the needs of all families, regardless of their composition or structure.
1399;In some countries children have very strict rules of behavior, in other countries they are allowed to do almost anything they like. To what extent should children have to follow rules?;Freedom plays a pivotal role in everybody’s life. We can see in today’s modernized era that nobody likes to be restricted, whether it is a child or an adult. Some people think that there should some strict rules of behavior for children, but I disagree with this statement.that sometimes more restrictions can cause more frustration in children, which leads to many other mental problems as well. they can . Sometimes they feel under pressure, which can be the main reason for their poor performance in their field. In some cases children may insist on doing .In other words we have to look other aspects as well, if we usually ignore our children’s bad habits, then they good human beings in their future life. Moreover if we never draw attention the children’s main activities then they might end up in a bad company. They the value of respect for their elders importance of relationships. They their cultural values as well.In a nutshell, I would like to say that children should be the value of their customs, rituals and respect towards their elders for their future life, but most of the additional restriction should . It would good human beings in their future.;The debate about the extent to which children should follow rules has sparked intense discussion globally. While some countries enforce strict rules of behavior on children, others adopt a more lenient approach, allowing them to do almost anything they like. In my opinion, children should follow rules to a certain extent, as it is essential for their development and well-being.On one hand, strict rules can provide children with a sense of discipline and responsibility. By following rules, children learn important life skills such as respect for authority, self-control, and time management. For instance, rules about bedtime, homework, and screen time can help children develop healthy habits and prioritize their education. Moreover, rules can also protect children from harm, ensuring their safety and security.On the other hand, giving children too much freedom can be beneficial for their emotional and psychological development. Allowing children to make choices and take risks can foster independence, creativity, and self-confidence. It can also help them develop problem-solving skills and learn from their mistakes. However, complete freedom can lead to chaos and a lack of boundaries, which can be detrimental to a child's development.In conclusion, I believe that children should follow rules to a certain extent. A balance between discipline and freedom is essential for their overall development. Parents, educators, and caregivers should establish clear rules and boundaries while also giving children the autonomy to make choices and learn from their experiences. By finding this balance, children can develop into responsible, independent, and well-rounded individuals who are equipped to succeed in life. Ultimately, the key is to find a middle ground that allows children to thrive while also teaching them valuable life skills.
681;In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development;Nowadays, many businesses have to compete each other in order to survive from the rapidly changing world, leading to the high amount of time that employees spend on working. There are also other reasons why the employees work for a long period which I will discuss in this essay. In terms of consequences, I personally believe that spending most of our time at work is the negative development.It is the fact that people have various rationales to work for long hours. A classic example is the dynamic working condition. There are many companies that provide services such as consultation to customers, meaning that if their service does not completely satisfy the clients’ need, such client may decide to use the service from other competitors. Hence, the employees are required to dedicate their time to deliver the best service to the clients. Another common criticism is a bright career path. When the employees work for a long period, they can carefully check their works and, as a result, delivery the works with less mistakes. Doing this way could impress their manager and they are likely to get promotion in return.With a careful consideration regarding the consequence of working for long hours, there are many vital drawbacks. An obvious effect is the increase in illness. People who work very hard have to spend a lot of their time at work. Therefore, they may not have enough time to do exercises, weakening the immune system of their body. Furthermore, with the rise in the amount of working hours, people tend to lack social skills. This is because they may not be able to manage time to join social events or meet their friends, resulting in the less ability to adapt to new environments.In conclusion, it is undeniable that people work for long hours because of the requirement in business and personal career goal which, in my opinion, leads to negative development for themselves. This is because this behavior negatively affects their health condition and social competency which are the two most important aspects in our life.;In many countries, it has become a norm for people to spend long hours at work, often exceeding the standard eight-hour day. This phenomenon can be attributed to several factors. One of the primary reasons is the competitive nature of the global economy, where businesses strive to stay ahead of their competitors by maximizing productivity and efficiency. As a result, employees are often required to put in extra hours to meet deadlines and achieve targets.Another factor contributing to long working hours is the cultural expectation of dedication and commitment to one's job. In some societies, working long hours is seen as a sign of hard work and loyalty, and employees who put in extra hours are often rewarded with promotions and bonuses. Additionally, the rise of technology has blurred the lines between work and personal life, making it easier for employees to be constantly connected to their work and expected to be available 24/7.However, this trend of long working hours is largely a negative development. Prolonged working hours can lead to physical and mental exhaustion, decreased productivity, and a poor work-life balance. It can also have negative impacts on employees' health, relationships, and overall well-being. Furthermore, it can lead to burnout, absenteeism, and turnover, ultimately affecting the organization's performance and success.In conclusion, while the reasons for long working hours may seem justified, the consequences far outweigh any potential benefits. It is essential for organizations and governments to recognize the importance of maintaining a healthy work-life balance and take measures to prevent employee burnout. By promoting flexible working hours, providing adequate breaks, and encouraging employees to prioritize their well-being, we can create a more sustainable and productive work environment that benefits both employees and employers.
101;In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .;Over decades, there has been a belief that adults should support adolescents to work in a company or travel to another country at least one year before going to university. Despite the fact that there are many positive aspects of having experiences in terms of working and travelling before studying at university, with a careful consideration, there are also negative points of this.It is true that working or travelling before starting a university program positively affects juveniles’ development. A classic example of this is an effective way to truly understand their academic preferences. When juveniles have work experiences, such as having a one-year internship in a company, they tend to learn a wide variety of work functions, helping them know the academic discipline they want to learn at university. Another benefit from taking a long journey to another place before studying at university is the opportunity to get exposed to new culture. This is because while adolescents are on an epic expedition to other parts of the world, they tend to meet new people with different nationality and belief, leading to valuable life experiences that they cannot receive from a professor at university.In spite of the aforementioned advantages of working or travelling before starting university courses, there are also drawbacks. A common example of this is graduating from a college late, compared to juveniles who immediately start a university program after they finish high school. This is exemplified by Thai culture which believes that young people who graduate from university later than their peer would not have a successful career path. In addition, opponents of this notion might argue that working before finishing university is not well worth doing. Since most works require a strong academic foundation in order for juveniles to deliver results with fewer mistakes, the juveniles should study at university instead.In conclusion, it is undeniable that having work experiences or taking a journey before starting a university life has many benefits for young people with respect to knowing the academic fields they want to study and learning new cultures outside a classroom. Nevertheless, doing this could also have drawbacks in terms of the delay in university graduation and an ineffective performance in working.;The gap year, a period of time between finishing high school and starting university studies, has become a popular trend among young people in some countries. During this year, many youngsters choose to work or travel,,assistant to gain life experience and broaden their horizons. In this essay, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of taking a gap year.On the one hand, there are several advantages to taking a gap year. Firstly, it provides young people with an opportunity to gain practical work experience, which can be beneficial in their future careers. Many students use this time to intern or volunteer, acquiring skills and building their professional network. Additionally, traveling during the gap year allows students to explore different cultures, meet new people, and develop independence. This break from academic studies can also help students to recharge and refocus, leading to better academic performance in university.On the other hand, there are also some disadvantages to consider. One of the main drawbacks is that taking a gap year can lead to a loss of momentum in academic pursuits. Some students may find it difficult to get back into the habit of studying after a year-long break, which can negatively impact their academic performance. Furthermore, taking a gap year can also lead to a delay in graduating, which may put students at a disadvantage in the competitive job market. Moreover, the financial burden of traveling or living independently during the gap year can be a significant challenge for many young people.In conclusion, taking a gap year can be a valuable experience for young people, providing them with opportunities to gain practical experience, explore different cultures, and develop independence. However, it also has its drawbacks, including the potential loss of academic momentum and financial burden. Ultimately, whether or not to take a gap year depends on individual circumstances and priorities. With careful planning and consideration, a gap year can be a rewarding and enriching experience that prepares young people for their future academic and professional pursuits.
1304;In some countries, boys and girls are educated separately after the age of about ten years old. Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;In many countries around the world, boys and girls are educated together. There is a group of countries, however, that educate boys and girls separately. This is frequently done on religious grounds, but not always. Having such a system can produce various advantages and disadvantages.One of the principal reasons for educating boys and girls separately is that, if they are together, they can distract each other. After puberty, boys can be strongly attracted to girls and vice versa, and this can result in disruptive conduct in the classroom as, for example, they show off to one another. Separating boys and girls can therefore have the distinct advantage of reducing this disturbing behaviour. However, some teachers have pointed out that this model does not always work, and that separated boys and girls are equally disruptive in class, and sometimes more so. These teachers say that having the opposite sex in the classroom can actually improve behaviour.Many educators also believe that boys and girls have different learning styles and needs. Separating boys and girls can allow teachers to address these needs more easily. There is also a belief that single sex schools allow gender stereotypes to be challenged and therefore education aspirations can be broadened.A major disadvantage of separating boys and girls in education is that the children miss important formative behavioural development when they do not have interaction with the other gender on a regular basis. This can lead to shyness and, more seriously, dysfunctional relationships later in life. Some people also feel that mixed sex schools can promote gender stereotypes rather than reducing them.In conclusion, I feel that children should be educated all together, although I would respect a system in which they are separated due to religious beliefs. My personal opinion is that different genders should learn to interact together from an early age, as this would allow them to develop healthy working relationships with each other.;The practice of separating boys and girls in educational institutions after the age of ten is a common phenomenon in some countries. This approach is based on the notion that single-sex education fosters better learning, improves discipline, and reduces distractions. Proponents of this system argue that boys and girls have different learning styles, and separating them allows for more tailored teaching methods.However, I strongly disagree with this view. I believe that co-education, where boys and girls learn together, is more beneficial for several reasons. Firstly, it promotes socialization and helps students develop essential life skills such as communication, teamwork, and conflict resolution. In a co-educational setting, boys and girls interact with each other, which prepares them for the real world where they will be working and interacting with people of both sexes. For instance, in many Western countries, co-education is the norm, and it has been observed that students from such systems are more confident, open-minded, and better equipped to handle relationships and challenges in their personal and professional lives.Furthermore, separating boys and girls can perpetuate stereotypes and reinforce gender biases. In a single-sex education system, students may miss out on the opportunity to learn from and appreciate the perspectives of the opposite sex, which can lead to a narrow and biased worldview. Additionally, it can create unrealistic expectations and reinforce outdated gender roles, which can be detrimental to both boys and girls.In conclusion, while the idea of separating boys and girls in education may seem appealing, I firmly believe that co-education is more beneficial. It prepares students for the real world, promotes socialization, and helps break down gender stereotypes. As such, I think that educational institutions should focus on providing a balanced and inclusive learning environment where boys and girls can learn together and from each other.
785;In some countries, only few young people go to classical music concerts or or play classical music. Why? Should young people be encouraged to attend and learn more?;Classical music is one of the oldest artistic samples of our history. However, the young people of the new generations do not appreciate this kind of music. I believe that governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and I will support my stand with valid arguments in the following paragraphs.First of all, the main reason behind the little interest of young people in classical music is the impact of globalization in music and arts. That is because people have the opportunity to know more about multiple things without leaving their homes. However, all this knowledge is only superficial and arts, more specifically classical music, is diminished by the big international industry of music. For instance, reggaeton music, despite the fact that its lyrics are often misogynous, is the most popular style of music these days.Another reason is that children and young people have less interest in cultural matters than in the past because governments do not invest in culture and arts. In most countries, investment in culture has been drastically reduced and young people have no access to classical music concerts and much less a musical instrument that has a huge cost. Consequently, governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and the arts.To summarise, this essay has examined the idea of classical music and why young people do not have an interest in this kind of music. As far as I am concerned governments should take responsibility in this matter and invest more money in culture and classical music encouraging young people to learn more about this kind of art.;The dwindling interest of young people in classical music is a phenomenon observed in several countries. There are several reasons that contribute to this trend. One primary reason is the lack of exposure to classical music from a young age. Unlike pop or rock music, which is ubiquitous and easily accessible, classical music is often reserved for specialized concerts or events, which may not be as appealing or relatable to the younger generation. Additionally, the complexity and sophistication of classical music may intimidate some young people, making it seem inaccessible or boring.Another factor is the prevalence of modern technology and social media, which has led to a shift in entertainment preferences. Young people are more inclined to listen to music that is catchy, upbeat, and easily shareable, rather than the more nuanced and intricate compositions of classical music. Furthermore, the cultural and social associations of classical music, often perceived as elitist or outdated, may also deter young people from exploring this genre.Despite these reasons, it is essential to encourage young people to attend and learn more about classical music. Classical music has numerous benefits, including improving cognitive skills, fostering creativity, and promoting cultural appreciation. Moreover, it provides a unique opportunity for young people to develop their critical thinking and emotional intelligence. By introducing classical music in schools, community centers, or online platforms, we can make it more accessible and appealing to the younger generation. Workshops, concerts, and interactive events can also help to break down the perceived barriers and showcase the diversity and richness of classical music. By doing so, we can ensure that classical music remains a vibrant and relevant part of our cultural heritage, and that young people can appreciate and enjoy its beauty and significance.
1334;In the modern world, it is possible to shop, work and communicate with people via the Internet and live without any face-to-face contact with others. Is it a positive or negative development?;The feasibility of shopping, working and communicating through the Internet is gradually eliminating the necessity of in-person encounters. I believe the merits of this opportunity outnumber its demerits and the lowered volume of traffic in addition to the possibility of long-range communication will be discussed as reasons for this claim in this essay.One chief benefit of using the Internet as a means of making purchases, working and communicating would be the lowered demand for transport, through eradicating the need for face-to-face contact. Such decreased volume of transportation would result in fewer harmful gas emissions which could significantly contribute to creating a cleaner environment. Furthermore, reduced commuting burden yields more free time for individuals. It could be spent in various ways such as working, studying and socialising with family and friends to name a few, which would be more productive and enjoyable.Another key merit of using the Internet would be the emergence of state-of-the-art telecommunication applications. These technologies have made it possible for those with access to the Internet to get in touch and send and receive audiovisual content by pushing just a few buttons. This presents a stark contrast to the situation only a few decades ago, when long-distance communication was possible solely through paper-based letters, which could possibly take months to reach the recipient.There are, however, some drawbacks to online communication, in particular the possibility that the lack of contact brought by technological advancements could potentially weaken human bonds. Taking into consideration that humans are sociable species, this could pose a dire threat to our mental health. This predicament, however, would be mitigated by the extra free time technological developments create for us. This free time could be spent with friends and family and in the long run would strengthen our relationships and improve our emotional wellbeing.To recapitulate, the Internet’s demolishing the need for person-to-person contact brings about numerous benefits. A more sustainable environment as well as more free time generated for individuals, a reduced need to commute in addition to the feasibility of conducting long-distance communication in the easiest way possible, are all instances of the above-mentioned merits.;The advent of the internet has revolutionized the way we live, work, and interact with one another. With the click of a button, we can now shop, work, and communicate with people from all corners of the globe without ever having to leave our homes or engage in face-to-face contact. While this development has brought about numerous benefits, such as increased convenience and accessibility, I firmly believe that it is a negative development.On the one hand, the lack of face-to-face contact can lead to social isolation and loneliness. Human beings are inherently social creatures, and we thrive on interactions with others. Prolonged periods of solitude can have detrimental effects on our mental and emotional well-being. Furthermore, the absence of nonverbal cues, such as body language and facial expressions, can lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, which can be detrimental in both personal and professional relationships.On the other hand, the internet has also eroded traditional social skills, such as communication, empathy, and conflict resolution. In the absence of face-to-face interactions, we may struggle to develop these essential skills, which are critical in building and maintaining meaningful relationships. Additionally, the over-reliance on digital communication can also lead to a decline in deep, meaningful conversations, and a lack of emotional intelligence.In conclusion, while the internet has undoubtedly made our lives more convenient, I believe that the lack of face-to-face contact is a negative development. It is essential that we strike a balance between our online and offline lives, and make a conscious effort to engage in regular face-to-face interactions to maintain our social, emotional, and mental well-being. By doing so, we can harness the benefits of the internet while also nurturing our fundamental human need for social connection.
1344;In the past people wore their traditional clothes, but these days most people wear similar clothes, is this a positive or negative development?;In the past, people wore their traditional clothes and followed their culture. These days, most people wear similar clothes and therefore look very similar to one another. Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?Sample EssayThese days, people’s perspectives on the value of clothing are changing, and individuals tend to wear similar clothing compared to people in the past who opted for their traditional clothing. I believe this tendency exerts a positive influence on the society.It is certainly true that there are some drawbacks to this tendency because it may lead to a loss of global diversity. It can be argued those who wear ordinary clothes such as T-shirts and jeans cannot feel a connection to their roots, and they are likely to neglect their culture and the contribution of their ancestors. Therefore, these people may not take pride in their region, and they might migrate to an urban location rather than contribute to the development of their community. Consequently, many ethnic minorities could suffer from depopulation and eventually disappear.However, I believe that there are more positives than negatives in people opting for similar clothes. The first explanation is that individuals can feel a sense of unity with people all over the world even though they have different religions and ways of life. This would motivate people in the world to support one another, instead of thinking that different parts of the world should deal with their own problems when natural disasters and other terrible problems occur in different nations. Furthermore, this tendency is economically profitable. Generally speaking, as ordinary clothes are automatically manufactured, they can be produced faster and more affordably than traditional clothing such as Japanese Kimono, which is hand-crafted.In conclusion, although people today tend to wear similar clothes instead of traditional ones and this trend cause several problems, I believe that the society as a whole can reap more benefits of this tendency.All parts of the task have been covered. The writer presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt with suitable, widely covered and sufficiently supported ideas. The paragraphing is handled appropriately. The range of vocabulary allows the writer to convey the intended meaning. The overall control of grammar and punctuation is fine, with only a few errors mostly related to word choice (hover/tap on corrections in blue for details). Well done! Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;The shift in clothing preferences from traditional attire to modern, similar clothing is a phenomenon that has been observed globally. In the past, people took great pride in wearing their traditional clothes, which often reflected their cultural heritage and identity. However, with the advent of globalization and modernization, the world has witnessed a significant change in the way people dress.On the one hand, this development can be seen as positive. The adoption of similar clothing styles has facilitated global communication and interaction, making it easier for people from different cultures to connect and understand each other. It has also promoted a sense of unity and equality, as people from all walks of life can be seen wearing similar attire. Moreover, modern clothing is often more practical and comfortable, making it suitable for daily wear.On the other hand, this shift can also be viewed as a negative development. The loss of traditional clothing has led to a loss of cultural diversity and uniqueness, as people are no longer identifiable by their attire. Traditional clothes often held significant cultural and historical value, and their disappearance has resulted in a loss of cultural heritage. Furthermore, the homogenization of clothing styles has also led to the dominance of fast fashion, which has negative environmental and social implications.In conclusion, while the shift towards similar clothing styles has its advantages, such as promoting unity and practicality, it also has its drawbacks, including the loss of cultural diversity and the negative environmental impacts of fast fashion. Ultimately, a balance between modernity and tradition is necessary, where people can appreciate and wear their traditional clothes on special occasions, while also adopting modern clothing styles that are comfortable and practical.
641;"Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference. To what extent do you agree or disagree?";There is no doubt these days that the action of the individual is not powerful enough to make the environment better. Unless through laws created by the government and activities have been taken by companies that have a high impact. I strongly disagree with this idea. because there are other ways to help the government as an individual.In essay will prove my point with reasons and examples.Nowadays, people can use social media as a platform that has the power to tell people around the world how to behave. Therefore, an individual has the power to convince others to give higher attention to our environment and create a community that has specific goals to improve. For example, social media influencers could educate the volunteer and work with the youth to make the environment better. For instance, show the young people how to sort the waste and how dangerous the impact is if they do not act in such as way.Moreover, as individuals, people can start doing many actions which benefit the environment by themselves without obstructions. On the other hand, the government and companies should be aware too. For example, while the companies use the factories the government must be monitoring the discharge of fule.In conclusion, after carefully explaining my points of view, in my opinion, it is not necessary to wait for the government and the big companies to act activity for the environment because we as individuals can create and provide educational activities for the public to preserve the environment for the next generation.;I strongly disagree with the statement that individuals can do nothing to improve the environment and that only governments and large companies can make a difference. While it is true that governments and large companies have a significant impact on the environment due to their scale and resources, the collective actions of individuals can also lead to substantial positive change.Individuals can make a significant difference by adopting environmentally friendly habits in their daily lives, such as reducing energy consumption, using public transport, recycling, and conserving water. Moreover, individuals can also make conscious choices about the products they buy, opting for sustainable and eco-friendly options. For instance, choosing products with minimal packaging or buying locally sourced produce can reduce carbon footprint and support the local economy.Furthermore, individuals can also influence others and create a ripple effect by sharing their knowledge and practices with friends, family, and community. This can lead to a grassroots movement, where collective action can pressure governments and companies to adopt more sustainable policies and practices. Additionally, individuals can also participate in local environmental initiatives, such as clean-up campaigns, tree planting, and conservation efforts, which can have a significant impact on the local environment.In conclusion, while governments and large companies have a critical role to play in protecting the environment, individuals should not underestimate the power of their own actions. By making small changes to their daily habits and choices, individuals can contribute to a larger movement towards sustainability and environmental protection. Therefore, it is essential to recognize the importance of individual actions and encourage everyone to take responsibility for their impact on the environment.
1237;"Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.";"Pollution free environment is important for our life's health and even enjoyement.Everyone whether an individual or large entitiy has an impact on the environment; regardless whether it was good or bad. Hence, I believe it is the responsibility of individulas as well as governments and large companies.Individuals can do a lot to improve the environemt around them starting with taking some actions to make a difference. For example, every memeber in the sociaty can support recycling efforts by sorting their garbages into different categoreis, instead of wasting the efforts of recycling companies to do so. Another exmaple would be to stop using plastic products and replace them with more environemt friendly products like pepar products.Moreover, teaching and spreading awarness about the importance of keeping our environemt clean are another way to make a difference. For instance, we can use social media to spread awarness and start campaigns about enviorment and pollution. Furthermore, we can teach some classes in schools and universities about this subject. As a result, this will help the upcoming generations to understand the problem and have them continue the efforts of improvement.While individuals efforts are essential, they must be supported by governments and large companies in order to complete the circle. A main example here would be establishing regulations and laws that would minimze the damage to the environment and maintain pollution at low levels, which is the role of the governments around the world. As for large companies, they can support by adopting the best practicies and take the proper actions to reduce pollution and improve the environment. As an example, they can start using clean and renewable energies to power their facilities and plants. In addition, those companies can develop technologies that contributes toward keeping the environment safe, and prompet the use of clean energy and vehicales.To sum up, the responsibility to improve the environemt must be divided between all three parties individuals, governments, and large companies. Each has his role to enhnace the environemnt and reduce the pollution. They complete each other and they should work together toward a better future for our world.";"I strongly disagree with the statement that individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference. While it is true that governments and large companies have a significant impact on the environment, I believe that individuals also play a crucial role in protecting and preserving the environment.There are many ways in which individuals can make a positive impact on the environment. For example, simple actions such as reducing energy consumption, recycling, and using public transport can collectively make a significant difference. Additionally, individuals can make conscious choices about the products they buy, choosing sustainable and eco-friendly options whenever possible. Furthermore, individuals can also participate in local environmental initiatives, such as clean-up campaigns and conservation projects, which can have a significant impact on the local environment.A notable example of individual action making a difference is the ""reduce-reuse-recycle"" movement, which was started by a group of individuals and has now become a global phenomenon. This movement encourages people to reduce their use of single-use plastics, reuse items whenever possible, and recycle as much as they can. This movement has led to a significant reduction in plastic waste and has raised awareness about the importance of sustainability.In conclusion, while governments and large companies do have a significant role to play in protecting the environment, I believe that individuals can also make a significant difference. Through simple actions and conscious choices, individuals can contribute to a more sustainable future. Therefore, I strongly disagree with the statement and believe that individual actions can collectively lead to significant positive change."
1301;It is a fact that the majority of people who are sent to prison commit further crime after their release.What is causing this? What can be done to change this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is a sad fact that criminals who leave prison go on to commit further crime. There are various reasons for this, but there are also some things that can be done to prevent it from happening.One reason for this recidivism is due to a lack of legitimate income. Many people turn to crime as they cannot find an alternative to earn money. When such person comes out of prison, it is very often the case that they have the same few opportunities for a legitimate income. In fact, these opportunities will even be reduced, as employers are often less willing to give an ex-prisoner a job. Some people also return to crime, as they spend all the time of their prison sentence with other criminals. This is not a great environment for rehabilitation, and sometimes even a network of contacts can be made to help develop criminal activities on release.One important way to help address this problem is education. Criminals who have turned to illegal activities because of no alternatives to earn a living need to learn a way to earn a wage, such as a trade or vocational skills. Computer skills, for example, are in high demand and someone trained in these could very possibly find work. In addition, governments can offer incentives to employers to attract them to give jobs to newly-released prisoners. This would help people who don’t really want to return to crime achieve a fresh start. As keeping people in prison is an expensive business, governments might find it cheaper to pay these incentives.To sum up, people returning to crime is a tragedy that should be avoided if at all possible in today’s society. Education and incentives can directly address the reasons for it and could make society a happier and safer place.;The high recidivism rate among ex-convicts is a pressing concern that plagues the criminal justice system. It is estimated that the majority of individuals released from prison go on to commit further crimes, perpetuating a cycle of incarceration and reoffending. This phenomenon is attributed to a complex array of factors, including inadequate rehabilitation programs, lack of social support, and limited job opportunities.One primary cause of recidivism is the inability of prisons to provide effective rehabilitation programs. Many prisons focus on punishment rather than rehabilitation, leaving inmates without the necessary skills and support to reintegrate into society. For instance, a study found that prisoners who participated in vocational training and counseling programs were significantly less likely to reoffend than those who did not. This highlights the importance of providing inmates with access to education, job training, and mental health services to equip them with the tools to lead law-abiding lives.Another significant factor contributing to recidivism is the lack of social support and community ties. Ex-convicts often face stigma and discrimination, making it challenging to secure employment, and rebuild relationships with family and friends. To address this, community-based initiatives, such as mentorship programs and support groups, can provide ex-convicts with a network of positive influences and help them reintegrate into society.To change the cycle of recidivism, governments and correctional facilities must prioritize rehabilitation and reintegration efforts. This can involve investing in evidence-based programs, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and job training, as well as providing support for ex-convicts to access education, employment, and social services upon release. By adopting a more holistic approach to corrections, we can work towards reducing recidivism rates and creating safer, more supportive communities for all.
1336;It is believed that people who read for pleasure develop their imagination more and acquire better language skills compared to people who prefer watching television. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Some people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. Personally, I support this opinion for several reasons, which will be laid out in this essay.As we all know, books use text to convey ideas and quite often there are no images or illustrations to picture the scenes described in the book; therefore, we have to use our own imagination while reading. For example, reading a fantasy novel that contains mythical creatures one would normally see the appearance of those characters in their mind while following the plot. In contrast, movie heroes on a TV screen are usually created for the viewer by directors and producers of the film. Watching TV substitutes the need to develop one’s own imagination because the characters and their surroundings are shown on the screen.Furthermore, it is argued that reading is the best way to expand one’s vocabulary. The reader learns the correct spelling of a word by seeing it printed in a book, and they grasp its meaning from the context, without having to look it up in a dictionary. Not only new words but also numerous sentence structures can be learnt from books. To take advantage of these benefits English teachers in many schools use English novels as teaching materials. Students are asked to read the story and capture the keywords to answer the questions in the exam. In comparison, learning new words while watching a TV show isn’t always easy because the viewer’s attention is drawn to the action on the screen and if there are no subtitles, the spelling of the words is not obvious. All this makes a book a more effective tool for a language learner compared to TV.In conclusion, I believe people who love to read tend to have a more active imagination and advanced linguistic comprehension than those who watch television, since readers are required to imagine the story in the book and learn the meaning of new words from the context.";The notion that individuals who read for pleasure enhance their imagination and language skills more effectively than those who prefer watching television is a widely debated topic. In my opinion, I agree to a large extent with this statement. Reading for pleasure has been shown to have a profound impact on cognitive development, particularly in the areas of imagination and language acquisition.On one hand, reading stimulates the mind, as it requires the reader to conjure up mental images of characters, settings, and events. This cognitive process enables readers to develop their imagination, fostering creativity and innovation. Furthermore, reading exposes individuals to a vast array of linguistic structures, vocabulary, and grammatical concepts, which can significantly enhance language skills. Through reading, people can acquaint themselves with different writing styles, genres, and dialects, broadening their linguistic repertoire.On the other hand, watching television can be a more passive activity, where the viewer is presented with a pre-constructed visual narrative, requiring less cognitive effort. Although watching television can provide some exposure to language, it is often limited to dialogue and may not offer the same depth and complexity as written texts. Moreover, television programs frequently rely on visual effects, which can stifle the viewer's imagination, as the narrative is already visually presented.However, it is essential to acknowledge that some television programs, such as documentaries and educational shows, can provide valuable knowledge and spark imagination. Nonetheless, I firmly believe that reading for pleasure remains a more effective means of developing imagination and language skills. Ultimately, the benefits of reading, including enhanced imagination and linguistic abilities, make it an invaluable activity for cognitive development and personal growth.
753;It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;"Nowadays a lot of primary schools are starting to introduce the teaching of animal care and general agriculture. Many people think that primary children should study and understand how to grow vegetables and keep animals; this essay will discuss why primary school should learn about this two arguments and how the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.It is very important study and understand how to grow vegetables and how to keep animals, especially in a younger age. Most of the kids, that frequent the primary school, have this desire of having a pet and, the opportunity of studying how to take care of it in the school, can make the child more aware of the responsibilities that he will have if, one day, he has to own one of them. At the same time, for a primary children it's also important to understand how vegetables grown and what's the process behind that , learning about this arguments will help the kids to appreciate more the food and, as a consequence, in the future there will be less waste of it .It's clear that the advantages will be more than the disadvantages, if there are any. If every kid will know more about the arguments, the world in the future will become a better place, with more respect for the animals and more appreciation for the vegetables that, will also help people to make a healthier life.In conclusion, this essay discussed on how the introduction of subjects like animal care and general understanding of how vegetables grow, will help the kids to become better adults in the future to make of this world a better place.";The suggestion that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals has sparked a debate about the potential benefits and drawbacks of such a proposal. In my opinion, the advantages of teaching primary children these skills far outweigh the disadvantages.On the one hand, the benefits of learning to grow vegetables and keep animals are numerous. For instance, it can help children develop important life skills such as responsibility, teamwork, and self-sufficiency. By participating in the process of planting, nurturing, and harvesting vegetables, children can gain a deeper understanding of where their food comes from and the importance of sustainable living. Additionally, learning to care for animals can foster empathy, compassion, and a sense of stewardship for the natural world.On the other hand, some may argue that incorporating these activities into the primary school curriculum could be time-consuming, costly, and potentially distracting from core academic subjects. However, I would counter that these activities can actually complement and enhance traditional learning. For example, measuring the growth of plants or calculating the feed required for animals can help reinforce mathematical concepts. Moreover, the hands-on, experiential nature of these activities can make learning more engaging and enjoyable, potentially leading to improved academic outcomes.In conclusion, teaching primary children to grow vegetables and keep animals offers a wide range of benefits, from developing life skills and promoting sustainability to enhancing academic learning. While there may be some logistical challenges to overcome, these are far outweighed by the advantages. By incorporating these activities into the curriculum, we can help shape a more responsible, compassionate, and environmentally conscious next generation.
1296;It is the responsibility of individuals to save and provide for their own retirement. Governments have no obligation to provide this benefit.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The responsibility for providing funds for retirement is incredibly important and something that is often overlooked by younger people. Some believe it is the responsibility of the individual to plan for this, but others feel it is the responsibility of the state.People who believe that the state should be responsible for funding retirees, base their argument on the fact that in most countries, people pay taxes and social charges to the government. This money, they argue, should also go towards the provision of a pension for the person paying the tax. In addition, those who have very small or no income, pay little or no tax and do not have the ability to provide for themselves. The government, therefore, in its role of caring for the population, has an obligation to pay a pension and provide other social benefits, such as medical treatment.Many others, however, feel that it is the responsibility of individuals to fund their own retirements. As adults, they argue, people should be able to set aside and invest money throughout their lifetime, so that they can retire with few financial worries. In many countries the government has legislated a framework allowing and encouraging citizens to save up and accumulate sufficient funds for the period after their working years have ended.I neither agree nor disagree with the statement, but rather my opinion takes in parts of both arguments. I feel that people should be responsible for saving money to fund their retirement, but I also feel that individuals who have not had the chance to do so should be supported by the government out of taxes. In my view, therefore, it is wrong to say that governments have no obligation to help people in this area. Governments are there to support the entire population of their countries, which includes the poorer elements of society.;I partially disagree with the statement that it is the responsibility of individuals to save and provide for their own retirement, and that governments have no obligation to provide this benefit. While individuals should take an active role in planning and saving for their retirement, as it allows them to have greater control over their financial security, there are valid reasons why governments should also contribute to retirement benefits.On one hand, individuals have the ability to make informed decisions about their own financial planning, which enables them to prepare for retirement according to their personal circumstances and goals. Moreover, when individuals are solely responsible for their retirement savings, they are more likely to be motivated to make prudent financial decisions, such as starting to save early and consistently, and making smart investment choices.On the other hand, there are instances where individuals may face challenges in saving for retirement due to unforeseen circumstances such as job loss, health issues, or low income levels. In such cases, government support can act as a safety net, ensuring that retirees have a minimum standard of living. For instance, countries with well-established pension systems, like Denmark or Sweden, demonstrate how government-provided retirement benefits can significantly reduce poverty among the elderly and contribute to social stability. Furthermore, a government-funded retirement system can also promote economic growth by providing retirees with a stable income, which they can then use to support local businesses and stimulate economic activity. It is also worth noting that many individuals may not have the necessary financial literacy or access to appropriate retirement savings vehicles, making it difficult for them to effectively plan for their retirement. In these scenarios, government intervention can provide the necessary guidance and support.In conclusion, while individuals should take responsibility for saving for their retirement, governments also have a role to play in ensuring that citizens have a secure and dignified retirement. A balanced approach where both individuals and governments contribute to retirement planning is likely to yield the best outcomes for retirees.
1287;It must be a woman who stays at home to care for children. Men are not suited to this kind of work. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Traditionally in many parts of the world, it has been women who have stayed at home to care for children. This has led to the ideology and expectation that women are more suited to this type of work than men.The overwhelming status quo where women stay at home to care for the children probably derives from the fact that women are the ones who have to actually give birth to children and, following that, they are the ones who for the early part of a child’s life have to feed the child until it is weaned. In times past, this state of affairs probably led to the women assuming the permanent role of carer for the home and children, whilst men went out to work, whether it was to gather food or work in fields or factories.In spite of the fact that this became what was expected in family dynamics, it does not mean that men are necessarily less suited to caring for a child than women. It is very possible for men to care for a child, even from birth onwards in today’s world. Babies’ milk formula can be mixed by anyone and fed to a child. The fact that many women today choose not to do this again does not mean that they are better suited by nature to care for the child.Suitability for childcare is a matter for individual temperament and aptitude. Not many people, whether they are men or women, feel totally confident and knowledgeable about how to care for a baby or young child at the start. They need advice from their own mothers and fathers, midwives or from books. It is only from experience that skill with childcare comes and this skill can be acquired regardless of gender.All in all, I do not agree with the statement that men are less suited to childcare than women. I believe that aptitude to look after children is a matter of individual temperament, not gender-specific inherited qualities.;I strongly disagree with the statement that it must be a woman who stays at home to care for children and that men are not suited to this kind of work. This notion is outdated and reinforces harmful gender stereotypes. In today's society, the idea that childcare is solely a woman's responsibility is no longer tenable. Men are just as capable of providing loving care and nurturing to their children as women are.In fact, many men are now taking on more active roles in childcare and are proving to be excellent caregivers. With the rise of stay-at-home dads, it is becoming increasingly common to see men pushing strollers, changing diapers, and attending parent-teacher conferences. This shift in traditional gender roles not only benefits the children, who receive loving care from both parents, but also allows men to develop a deeper bond with their kids.Moreover, research has shown that involved fathers have a positive impact on their children's cognitive, emotional, and social development. Children who have active and engaged fathers tend to have better academic performance, higher self-esteem, and fewer behavioral problems. This highlights the importance of men's involvement in childcare and challenges the notion that they are not suited to this kind of work.Additionally, many countries, such as Sweden and Denmark, have implemented policies that encourage men to take parental leave, which has led to a significant increase in the number of men staying at home to care for their children. These policies have not only helped to promote greater equality in the home but also contributed to a more balanced distribution of childcare responsibilities.In conclusion, the statement that it must be a woman who stays at home to care for children and that men are not suited to this kind of work is no longer valid. Men are just as capable as women of providing excellent care to their children, and their involvement in childcare is essential for the well-being and development of their kids. As society continues to evolve, it is essential that we challenge and reject outdated gender stereotypes and promote greater equality and flexibility in childcare responsibilities.
1105;It's generally believed that success in fields such as art and sport can only be achieved if a person has natural talent. However, it's sometimes claimed that any child can be taught to become a good sports person or artist.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"It is common to think that in fields like art or sport success is linked to natural talent, even though it is stated that children can obtain good results also trough learning and pratice.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------In my opinion, I believe that only a combination of natural talent and sacrifice can lead you to obtain success; for this reason, you can learn and improve several skills, but you will not win against a person with this type of gift, unless this person does not pratice enough.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------To provide an example, if we think about Raffaello, one of the most remarkable painters of all times, and his life we may be disappointed; in fact, thanks to his natural talent he started to paint since he was 8.However, we have to bear in mind that he constantly made a research in order to discover new techniques and to gain new inspirations.If he was not so focused on his art's improvement, he would not be able to paint an entire church.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------If we move to another field as sport is always more evident the existence of a pattern. Indeed, it is crystal clear that professional players need to pratice everyday, regardless their talent.However, Ronaldo this year has winned the nominee for the best football player in the world not only for his innate talent but also for the effort put during training in order to reach always an higher goal.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------In conclusion, through commitment you will obtain good results, but to achieve the highest level you must be gifted with a natural talent.";"The debate surrounding the role of natural talent in achieving success in fields like art and sport has been ongoing. On one hand, it is widely believed that innate ability is a prerequisite for excelling in these areas. Proponents of this view argue that a person's genetic makeup and inherent aptitude play a significant role in determining their potential for success. For instance, a child born with a naturally athletic build or a keen eye for color and composition may have an initial advantage in sports or art, respectively.On the other hand, some claim that any child can be taught to become a skilled sports person or artist, given the right training and dedication. This perspective emphasizes the importance of nurture over nature, suggesting that consistent practice, peer feedback, and expert guidance can help individuals develop the necessary skills to succeed. A notable example is the story of Stephen Wiltshire, an artist who was diagnosed with autism and learned to draw and paint through extensive practice and training, despite not being born with traditional artistic talents.In my opinion, while natural talent may provide an initial advantage, it is not the sole determining factor in achieving success in art or sport. With dedication, hard work, and the right training, individuals can develop the necessary skills to excel in these fields. Additionally, the concept of ""talent"" is often subjective and can be influenced by various factors such as access to resources, social support, and personal motivation. Therefore, I believe that both nature and nurture play a role in determining success, and that any child can be taught to become a good sports person or artist with the right mindset and opportunities."
1420;Learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Evaluation of the importance of timing is essential, past to show the importance of their present, while that to even remember their past because it would not help them at all. It is a very controversial and complicated matter., many people believe this statement, for many reasons. Firstly, all of us had made many mistakes which we would not like to remember, they will affect their present because they can create some problems with our families example. Secondly, instead of remembering those past trials, one should get the benefits of their present.Regardless of what I said previously, many people are sticking to their past to give themselves a push in their present. It can give a way of learning from mistakes, and a good chance to try to avoid anything that once lead to a past failure.Moreover, success will not come without failure, everybody should make an attempt, even if it fails, and it may become a big success if they try it again and again. In addition, our past is our culture and heritage which we should not forget at all, it is a matter of value to our present and future, and will remain such till the day will die.To sum up, in my opinion, we can not live without a past, it is our value of life. it can help create your experiences and solve your problems better in the future.;I strongly disagree with the statement that learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present. Studying history provides invaluable insights and lessons that can be applied to our current lives. For instance, understanding the consequences of historical events, such as World War II, can help us prevent similar catastrophes from occurring in the future. By learning from the past, we can identify patterns and mistakes that led to devastating outcomes, thereby enabling us to make more informed decisions in the present.Moreover, learning about the past allows us to appreciate the progress and advancements that have been made in various fields, such as science, technology, and human rights. For example, the struggles of the civil rights movement in the United States can serve as a reminder of how far we have come in terms of racial equality, and how much work still needs to be done. This knowledge can motivate us to continue working towards a more just and equitable society.Additionally, history can provide us with a sense of cultural identity and belonging. By learning about our ancestors' traditions, customs, and achievements, we can develop a deeper understanding of our own cultural heritage and its significance in the modern world. This, in turn, can foster a sense of community and shared values, which are essential for building strong, cohesive societies.In conclusion, learning about the past is essential for those of us living in the present. It provides us with valuable lessons, a sense of cultural identity, and a deeper understanding of the complexities of human experience. By studying history, we can gain a broader perspective on the world, make more informed decisions, and work towards creating a better future for ourselves and future generations.
1197;Learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Learning about the past may provide advantages and disadvantages, depending on the position we are situate ourselves in life ;Undoubtedly, it has great advantages for the ones who need to progress in life, despite what they had been through, because to my opinion, greatest lessons in life come with our own experiences. Advantages of learning about the past are also on the side of the ones who personally know themselves very well and stay honest to themselves at all times.For example, someone who try to be someone, acting to please influent people or trying to get somewhere he or she would not be able to if he were playing real, could be embarrassed by their own mistakes or feeling humiliated when looking back to what he accomplished to get where he/she is now ; therefore the past in this situation would not be a great option for him to look back after.Despite this kind of personality, there are lots of people who find out constructive knowledge in looking back to the past, regardless of how great or bad it could be.The kind of people who actually face their own past and do not try to hide it are the ones who are not scared of how people will judge them, but are willing to make greate changes in their future.It is ,to me, the definition of true progress; how could we learn from our own experiences if we are not willing to face ourselves ?Past can be hurtful but I do think that everything we have been through is a constructive lesson for today and tomorrow.";I strongly disagree with the statement that learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present. Understanding the past is crucial for navigating the complexities of the present and shaping a better future. By studying history, we can gain valuable insights into the consequences of past actions, learn from the successes and failures of previous generations, and develop a deeper appreciation for the cultural, social, and economic context in which we live.For instance, learning about historical events such as World War II can provide us with a clearer understanding of the importance of diplomacy, international cooperation, and the devastating consequences of nationalism and prejudice. Similarly, studying the Civil Rights Movement in the United States can inform our perspectives on contemporary social justice issues, such as racial inequality and discrimination. By examining the past, we can identify patterns and trends that continue to influence our world today, and make more informed decisions about how to address ongoing challenges.Furthermore, learning about the past can also foster empathy, tolerance, and cultural understanding. By exploring the experiences and achievements of people from diverse backgrounds and time periods, we can broaden our perspectives, challenge our assumptions, and develop a more nuanced understanding of the human experience. In conclusion, the value of learning about the past lies in its ability to enrich our understanding of the present, inform our decisions about the future, and cultivate a more empathetic and informed global community. Therefore, I firmly believe that learning about the past has significant value for those of us living in the present.
1375;Many believe that international tourism is bad for their country (reasons and solutions);Many people believe that international tourism is a bad thing for their countries. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to change this negative attitude towards international tourism?Many individuals think that foreign tourism brings negative effects to their countries. There are several reasons for such negative attitude towards international travelers. However, a couple of solutions could be adopted to handle this situation, as will now be discussed.International tourists are often criticized for their contribution to the environmental degradation. It has continuously been noticed that they throw rubbish in their surroundings irresponsibly, which increases the amount of litter everywhere, despite all attempts to reduce waste produced by the local community. This contributes to water, air and soil contamination.Furthermore, foreign tourism has a harmful influence on traditional customs and indigenous practices of host countries because many tourists are careless and insensitive the emotions and feelings of local residents. For instance, in India, some foreign travelers wear inappropriate clothes or expose too much of skin when they visit sacred places, which leads to some negative attitude and the local public.However, this situation can be improved different solutions which could be handled by the government. The government should explain the benefits of international tourism which contributes to the development of local . They not only spend money in shops and restaurants but also create jobs in service industries, and this aspect could be publicized. Additionally, the government should increase the awareness among the foreigners through different media such as roadside billboards and advertisements, and tourists should be encouraged to get rid of rubbish correctly.In conclusion, the inhospitable feeling that the local people have for international tourists can be explained in many ways. However, in my opinion, the government’s involvement is essential to change the negative attitude by citing various advantages of international tourism to their country and raising awareness among tourists in order to protect local habitats.This essay covers the entire task topic by exploring both reasons for negative attitude towards international tourism and some possible actions to change it. The writer explains why locals may resent international tourists and suggests what steps can be taken to transform the way people feel about foreigners in their country. The information is well-organised by the use of paragraphing, and the writer moves from one idea to the next effortlessly, with the help of linking words. A wide range of vocabulary is used, including less common words such as “degradation”,”inhospitable”, “habitat”, “awareness” and “sacred”. Instances of inaccurate word choice are rare, and even these slips don’t cause difficulty for the reader. Overall, this looks like a Band 8 essay.;The notion that international tourism is detrimental to a country's well-being is a widely debated topic. Many believe that the influx of foreign visitors has a negative impact on the local environment, culture, and economy. One of the primary concerns is the strain that tourism puts on natural resources, such as water and energy. The increased demand for these resources can lead to scarcity and depletion, particularly in areas where infrastructure is already underdeveloped.Moreover, tourism can also lead to cultural homogenization, where local customs and traditions are lost amidst the influx of foreign influences. The commercialization of cultural heritage sites and historical landmarks can result in the erosion of their original significance and authenticity. Additionally, the tourism industry often prioritizes the interests of foreigners over those of locals, leading to displacement and marginalization of indigenous communities.To mitigate these negative effects, governments and tourism boards can implement sustainable tourism practices. This can include investing in eco-friendly infrastructure, promoting cultural sensitivity and awareness among tourists, and supporting local businesses and communities. Furthermore, implementing measures to manage tourist numbers and distribute them evenly throughout the year can help alleviate the strain on resources and infrastructure.Ultimately, international tourism can be a double-edged sword, bringing both economic benefits and cultural costs. However, with careful planning, management, and regulation, the negative impacts can be minimized, and the benefits can be shared equitably among local communities. By adopting a sustainable and responsible approach to tourism, countries can preserve their unique cultural identity, protect their natural environment, and ensure that the economic benefits of tourism are distributed fairly among all stakeholders.
1297;Many cities have areas where the only cars are taxis and buses.Is this a positive or a negative development? What are the effects of this on individuals and society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Banning cars from the centre of various cities around the world has been a strategy to reduce pollution and encourage people to use public transport. It has had various positive effects for both individuals and for society as a whole.Banning cars from the centre of cities seems to be a very positive development. Fewer cars on the road means less pollution and fewer fossil fuel resources being used up. Although the effect on resources might be relatively negligible, it can create a newer way of thinking regarding the dynamics of transport within cities and this could be the most important benefit to society. Some people working in the centre of these cities may complain about inconvenience, but many would agree that this is a small price to pay.A reduction in the reliance of people on private vehicles is likely to encourage them to use public transport or even bicycles. Using public transport, especially the types that run on clean sources of power, will significantly raise air quality levels in cities, which will of course benefit everyone. The clean air could even further encourage the use of bicycles, which would in turn promote more healthy lifestyles and less obesity. This would contribute on an individual level to people’s well-being and a better and longer life, and on a societal level, it would lessen the strain on public health resources. Governments could encourage this by creating more bicycle lanes to make cycling easier and safer.In conclusion, it is clear that banning cars from the centre of cities is significantly beneficial. Better health and ecology, as well as improvement in longevity and well-being can benefit individuals and the entire society.;The trend of restricting car access in certain areas of cities, allowing only taxis and buses, is a positive development. This initiative aims to reduce traffic congestion, minimize air pollution, and promote a more sustainable urban environment. By limiting the number of private vehicles in these areas, the streets become less crowded, which in turn decreases the likelihood of accidents and reduces travel times for public transportation and taxis.This development has numerous benefits for both individuals and society as a whole. For individuals, the improved air quality and reduced noise pollution create a healthier living and working environment. Moreover, the increased efficiency of public transportation and taxi services makes commuting easier and more reliable, which can lead to increased productivity and a better quality of life. For example, cities like Copenhagen have successfully implemented such policies, resulting in cleaner, safer, and more livable urban spaces.On a societal level, this development contributes to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, which is crucial in the global effort to combat climate change. It also promotes a shift towards more sustainable modes of transportation, such as cycling and walking, by making urban areas more pedestrian-friendly. This shift can lead to a more active and healthy population, reducing the burden on healthcare systems. Additionally, by prioritizing public and shared transportation, it fosters a sense of community and social cohesion among residents.However, it is also important to ensure that such policies are implemented with consideration for all members of society, including those who may rely on private vehicles due to mobility issues or other special needs. Proper planning and provision of alternative accessible transportation options are essential to make this development truly beneficial for everyone.In conclusion, the restriction of private cars in certain city areas, allowing only taxis and buses, is a forward-thinking approach to urban planning. It offers a multitude of benefits, from environmental and health improvements to enhanced quality of life and community building. With thoughtful implementation, this development can significantly contribute to creating more sustainable, equitable, and thriving cities.
1332;Many countries are experiencing population growth and need to build more homes. Some say that new homes should be constructed in existing cities while others argue that new towns should be built to accommodate the growing population. What are the advantages and disadvantages of these points of view?;In the past two decades, there has been an exponential increase in the migration of people to different cities and countries, indirectly resulting in a considerable infrastructure development. However, there has been a long-standing debate on whether to direct these infrastructure projects to current cities or establish new counties. Careful consideration of both alternatives reveals that each has its positives and negatives.One of the major advantages of focusing on current cities for new construction is that it would benefit the residents of the cities in multiple ways. Tenants living in Vancouver would prefer to buy a newly constructed house in the city where they work rather than in a new town, to reduce their commute time. Moreover, the city has everything they desire such as efficient public transport, thriving job market and affordable healthcare. This would not be possible in new towns because of the time it takes to establish services and generate opportunities for people.On the other hand, accommodating people in houses built in newly created towns would put them in a pollution-free and clean environment. This is because new towns may take at least 10 years of time to become an attractive spot for people and industries alike. As a result, their exposure to harmful emissions from industrial plants and transportation is reduced, shielding them from the risks of acquiring health complications. A recent report released by the word Health Organization (WHO) suggests that the number of people affected by airborne infections is 20% higher in cities compared to new towns that were formed just a couple of years ago.In conclusion, while there are both positive and negative aspects to these views, the decision on where to build the new homes to accommodate increasing population will depend on many other factors as well. Therefore, a thorough assessment is required before starting an infrastructure project.;The issue of accommodating a growing population is a pressing concern for many countries. Two schools of thought have emerged: one advocating for the construction of new homes in existing cities, and the other proposing the development of new towns. Each perspective has its advantages and disadvantages.On the one hand, constructing new homes in existing cities has several benefits. For instance, it allows for more efficient use of existing infrastructure, such as transportation systems, schools, and healthcare facilities. Additionally, it enables residents to access established amenities, including shops, restaurants, and entertainment options. However, this approach can lead to increased congestion, strain on existing resources, and higher costs of living.On the other hand, building new towns offers a clean slate for urban planning and design. New towns can be constructed with green technologies and sustainable infrastructure, providing a high quality of life for residents. Moreover, they can be designed to meet the specific needs of the growing population, including ample housing, community facilities, and employment opportunities. Nevertheless, building new towns can be a costly and time-consuming endeavor, requiring significant investment in infrastructure and services.Ultimately, a balanced approach that combines elements of both perspectives may be the most effective solution. By constructing new homes in existing cities and also developing new towns, countries can accommodate their growing populations while minimizing the drawbacks of each approach. This hybrid approach can help to distribute the population more evenly, reduce strain on existing cities, and provide residents with a range of housing options and amenities. By considering the advantages and disadvantages of each perspective, policymakers can make informed decisions to create thriving and sustainable communities for their growing populations.
1327;Many people argue that museums and art galleries should present the nation’s art, as opposed to artworks from other countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The cultural value of engaging with museums and art galleries is unquestionable; they exert a great deal of influence on our perception of the world. It is only reasonable to ponder whether or not these outlets of culture should concentrate their efforts on presenting the nation’s own art, and not that of other countries. In my opinion, there should be an attempt to strike a balance and put the objects of national art in the spotlight, while allowing the public to get acquainted with foreign artworks to a certain extent.If people were to only find sculptures and paintings by national artists in their local museums, that would have a number of positive effects, such as the fame the artists of that country would gain and the pride its citizens would feel for their fellow countrymen. It would promote patriotism and strengthen the image of the country in the eyes of its inhabitants. Local artists would also receive more financial assistance from the government as their works would generate a significant amount of interest, potentially resulting in further development of the local art. However, in order to evolve art needs fresh ideas, and without exposure to a wider range of creativity the world provides, the evolution of local arts may be hindered.People enjoy art because it appeals to their inner sense of beauty and triggers strong emotions, and whether the masterpiece that causes these feelings belongs to a local or foreign artist is irrelevant. Talent knows no geographical boundaries; therefore, the emphasis should be on how much joy or amazement the work of art brings, rather than on its origin. If that principle were to be followed, we would never have to choose between local and international art. Reducing our museums or galleries’ collections to local art works, in my view, would be harmful and go against the democratic nature of art.To sum up, it seems to me that a country has nothing to lose by allowing its people to admire art created elsewhere in the world. A conscious choice by the government to support local artists while hosting exhibitions from other countries could prove the most beneficial.";The debate surrounding the content of museums and art galleries has sparked intense discussion, with some arguing that these institutions should prioritize the nation's art over international pieces. While I understand the rationale behind this argument, I partially disagree with this stance.On the one hand, presenting a nation's art can foster a sense of national identity and cultural pride. By showcasing local artists and their works, it allows citizens to connect with their heritage and appreciate the unique perspectives and talents of their compatriots. Moreover, it can provide valuable opportunities for emerging local artists to gain recognition and exposure. For instance, a museum dedicated to showcasing the works of national artists can help to promote and preserve the country's cultural legacy.On the other hand, I believe that museums and art galleries should also exhibit artworks from other countries. This approach can facilitate cross-cultural understanding, education, and appreciation. By showcasing a diverse range of international art, visitors can gain insight into different cultures, historical periods, and artistic movements. This can broaden their perspectives, challenge their assumptions, and enrich their understanding of the world. Furthermore, it can also promote global cooperation, cultural exchange, and mutual respect.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the importance of showcasing a nation's art, I believe that museums and art galleries should strike a balance between presenting local and international artworks. By doing so, they can promote national pride, cultural diversity, and global understanding, ultimately enriching the lives of their visitors and contributing to a more informed and empathetic society.
955;Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?;Numerous experts think that every country should be capable to produce more materials and commodities. I agree with this argument as it brings benefits to countries and I will highlight some of them.To begin with, manufacturing goods is essential to any country as it helps to build their economy. Increasing production power assist them to export more and it also makes them less dependent on other countries. For instance, China is one of the largest producers in the world in any goods which also makes them the largest exporter. Such development in production power contributes to their gross domestic product.Another reason is that extra produced goods can be used in emergencies, such emergencies are pandemics, financial crises and many more. By growing the production of goods and materials, a country will always be a reliable business partner. Thus, companies will reach out to them and become loyal partners. Moreover, countries should be aware that by increasing their production. For example, there is a semiconductor chip crisis is going on all over the world and no country in the world is able to meet the demands of chips. On the contrary, India is now planning to satisfy the demand for chips by strengthening its manufacturing capacity to a massive level while it will directly contribute to their economy and also generate job opportunities.To conclude, I agree that more in-house production is necessary. It is extremely crucial to produce more needed products in order to consistently outperform the rest of the world and also it brings many beneficial things like generating job opportunities and a rise in the Gross domestic product of a country.;The notion that the primary objective of every country should be to constantly increase production has been a long-standing assumption. However, I partially disagree with this idea. While it is true that producing more materials and goods can lead to economic growth, increased employment opportunities, and improved living standards, there are also significant drawbacks to consider.On the one hand, increasing production can have numerous benefits, such as stimulating innovation, reducing prices, and expanding access to goods and services. This, in turn, can lead to higher standards of living and improved overall well-being. For instance, countries like Japan and South Korea have experienced rapid economic growth and development through aggressive industrialization and increased production.On the other hand, prioritizing production above all else can result in severe environmental degradation and depletion of natural resources. The pursuit of constant growth can lead to overconsumption, pollution, and waste, ultimately threatening the planet's ecological balance. Furthermore, the relentless drive for increased production can also lead to social problems, such as worker exploitation and increased income inequality.In conclusion, while increasing production can be beneficial for economic growth and development, it should not be the sole objective of a country. A more balanced approach, considering both economic, social, and environmental factors, is necessary. Governments and policymakers should strive for sustainable development, prioritizing the well-being of citizens and the planet, rather than solely focusing on constant production growth. By adopting a more holistic approach, countries can ensure long-term prosperity and environmental sustainability, rather than pursuing a goal that may ultimately prove detrimental to the well-being of their citizens and the planet.
1367;Many people believe that reducing speed limits is the best option for road safety improvement (agree/disagree);"Many people believe that reducing speed limits is the best option for road safety improvement. Do you think there are other measures that could be put in place? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this?One of the most conspicuous trends of today’s world is a colossal surge in the number of vehicle accidents cars, trucks and buses, all over the , be it in impoverished or developed nations. There is a wide range of factors that . In my opinion, this situation could be remedied, provided some effective measures are taken.Measures to deal with this soaring concern are many; the most significant are not remote or complicated but accessible and practicable. The primary one lies in the fact that governments should take a firm stance and apply stringent rules and regulations to lower the speed limit. Secondly, using electronic devices while driving should be forbidden by law. Finally, an awareness program could be initiated by individuals to educate the public about the catastrophic effects of unsafe roads and the projected enhancements for road safety. Only when convergent efforts from all sectors are ensured, can we expect to see considerable progress in tackling this problem.There is a deluge of merits for implementation of reduced speed limits. High speed is likely to impose life threatening danger on people crossing the roads, due to the perilous nature of this hazardous speed with danger being an integral part of it. Not only does reducing the speed limits contribute to decreasing daily accidents, but it also raises the standard of driving. Needless to say, all these advantages have a far-reaching impact on pedestrian safety.There are, however, some pitfalls that can easily overpower the potential benefits of limiting speed. The primary one stems from the fact that slowing the speed could lead to augmenting the daily traffic hours. Besides, it could also delay delivering sick and patients to hospitals. Hence, it is apparent why some individuals are against changing the standardized level of speed.From what has been discussed, one can conclude that despite the drawbacks of reducing speed limits, the expected benefits of this measure are indeed far greater.All the parts of the task have been covered fairly well. The response presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt with suitable, widely covered and thoroughly supported ideas. The range of vocabulary is adequate for the requirements of task response. There are some mistakes in word choice and grammar. Nevertheless, the essay is up to the mark and is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.";I agree that reducing speed limits is a viable option for road safety improvement. One of the primary causes of accidents on roads is excessive speeding, which can lead to a loss of control and increased stopping distances. By reducing speed limits, drivers are forced to slow down, thereby reducing the risk of accidents. This is particularly important in areas with high pedestrian activity, such as school zones and residential areas, where the risk of injury or death from accidents is higher.Additionally, lower speed limits can also lead to a reduction in the severity of accidents. When accidents do occur at lower speeds, the impact is typically less severe, resulting in fewer fatalities and less severe injuries. This is supported by numerous studies that have shown a direct correlation between speed and accident severity. For instance, the World Health Organization has reported that for every 1% reduction in speed, there is a corresponding 2% reduction in accidents.Moreover, reducing speed limits can also have other benefits such as reducing traffic congestion and noise pollution. When drivers are forced to slow down, they are more likely to drive smoothly and maintain a safe following distance, which can lead to a more orderly flow of traffic. This, in turn, can reduce the frustration and stress associated with driving, leading to a more pleasant and safe driving experience for all road users.However, it is also important to note that simply reducing speed limits is not a panacea for all road safety issues. Other factors such as driver education, road design, and vehicle maintenance also play a crucial role in ensuring road safety. Nonetheless, reducing speed limits is an important step towards creating safer roads, and when combined with other safety measures, can lead to a significant reduction in accidents and fatalities. Therefore, reducing speed limits is a worthwhile strategy for improving road safety.
1290;Many people believe that studying at university is the best way to develop oneself, learn new skills and find a well-paid job. Other people believe that more is learned from getting a job straight away after school and learning whilst working.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;There are many ways to learn new knowledge and skills. Traditional educational routes, such as school followed by college or university is one route that is generally accepted and respected by today’s society. It can be argued, however, that this is not always the best way. A more vocational route can be more appropriate for certain people and for particular jobs.Universities generally have deference given to them and, due to this, most schools tailor their programs to help students get university admission. Universities usually have respected and highly qualified teachers who have the knowledge and the skills to take their students to very high levels of knowledge and expertise. The very difficulty of gaining admission, getting through the duration of the course and passing final exams ensures to employers that graduates have the necessary self-discipline, intelligence and ability to get through the courses.Universities are also particularly well suited to the teaching of various subjects, for example, medicine, law and literature and these subjects need students’ full-time attention in order to do well. Although vocational experience is necessary, a certain grounding in basic concepts to a high-level is important. Once this knowledge has been acquired, students can then integrate their knowledge with practical understanding.This, however, is not the case for all areas of learning, especially ones where the quantity of high level knowledge is not required or is possible to be learned whilst working at the same time. Young people studying to be an electrician or a plumber are good examples. To do this work well requires a lot of experience, yet also a sound understanding of theory. The learning here can be and is done working and studying at the same time, often through apprenticeships and vocational courses involving significant amounts of work experience.Therefore, in my opinion, there are more ways than one to acquire a profession. Whether learning should take place at university alone or whilst working depends on the course and the end job.;The debate surrounding the best path to development, learning, and securing a well-paying job has sparked intense discussion. On one hand, many people believe that attending university is the optimal way to achieve these goals. University education provides a foundation for developing critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills, which are highly valued by employers. Moreover, university programs offer specialized knowledge and training in specific fields, thereby enhancing one's career prospects. For instance, fields like law, medicine, and engineering typically require university degrees. The structured learning environment and access to resources, such as libraries, libraries and laboratories, further support academic and personal growth.On the other hand, some argue that entering the workforce directly after school and learning through on-the-job training is more beneficial. This approach allows individuals to gain practical experience, develop skills tailored to their job requirements, and earn a salary while learning. Apprenticeships and vocational training are examples where individuals can learn a trade or skill while being employed. This route can be particularly advantageous in fields where hands-on experience is more valuable than theoretical knowledge, such as construction, culinary arts, or IT.In my opinion, a balance between both approaches is ideal. University education lays a solid foundation, but combining it with practical, work-based learning can accelerate personal and professional development. Many universities now offer internships, co-op programs, and project-based learning that integrate workplace experience into the curriculum. This blend of theoretical knowledge and practical application prepares individuals more comprehensively for their careers. Furthermore, in today's fast-paced, ever-changing work environment, the ability to continuously learn and adapt is crucial, a skill that can be honed through a combination of academic and professional experience.In conclusion, while both pathways have their merits, I believe that a combination of university education and on-the-job learning offers the most holistic approach to developing oneself, acquiring new skills, and securing a well-paying job. This balanced approach not only equips individuals with theoretical knowledge but also with the practical skills and adaptability needed to thrive in their chosen careers.
1288;Many people in cities today live in high-rise apartment blocks. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this type of living?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;High-rise apartment blocks are a common sight in cities around the world. They are especially popular in large cities and in locations where building land is scarce. Living in such buildings has various advantages and disadvantages for town planners and the inhabitants themselves.The most significant advantage of high-rise apartment blocks is probably for the town planners. With land often being at a premium in large cities, one way to maximise space is to build upwards, so that the population density per square kilometre can be increased. The demand for housing in big cities can therefore be more easily met. There are also disadvantages for town planners. The heavier population density can put added pressure on social facilities, for example sewage and other waste disposal, and the provision of adequate school and medical services.There are also advantages and disadvantages for the actual inhabitants of high-rise apartment blocks. With the demand for housing being reduced, prices are therefore not as high, making housing more affordable. Many people also like not having to be responsible for a garden, and living in an apartment has this advantage. Finally, with so many people living in the same area, many friendships can be made and a community spirit can be built up. It appears the most significant disadvantage is that, in practice, living in high-rise apartment blocks is just not the lifestyle many people want. In some city neighbourhoods, these living spaces can often be associated with poor living conditions and undesirable social elements. In addition, many people view high-rise apartment blocks as being unsafe. For example, in the case of fire, tall buildings are difficult or impossible to evacuate safely.It is clear that high-rise apartment blocks have benefits and drawbacks. It is also clear, however, that due to the need to house increasing numbers of people in cities, these architectural features are here to stay, whether people like them or not.;The proliferation of high-rise apartment blocks in urban areas has become a ubiquitous feature of modern city living. While this type of living offers several advantages, it also has its drawbacks. On the one hand, the benefits of high-rise apartment living are numerous. For instance, one of the primary advantages is the efficient use of land, which is particularly significant in densely populated cities where space is at a premium. By building upwards, more people can be accommodated in a smaller area, thereby reducing the pressure on urban sprawl and preserving green spaces. Additionally, high-rise apartments often provide residents with modern amenities such as swimming pools, gyms, and community areas, enhancing the quality of life for occupants.Furthermore, high-rise living typically offers enhanced security measures, including CCTV surveillance and secure entry systems, which can lead to a safer living environment. For example, in cities like Singapore, high-rise apartments are the norm, and residents often cite the sense of community and security as significant benefits. Moreover, the higher floors of these buildings often provide stunning views of the cityscape, which can be a unique advantage of this type of accommodation.On the other hand, there are several disadvantages to living in high-rise apartments. One of the main drawbacks is the lack of privacy and potential noise pollution from neighboring apartments. The close proximity of living quarters can lead to disturbances and a lack of personal space, which might be overwhelming for some residents. Another significant disadvantage is the reliance on elevators and other mechanical systems, which can be prone to breakdowns, leaving residents stranded or inconvenienced. For instance, during power outages, residents of high-rise buildings can face significant challenges, including being unable to access their homes if they are on higher floors.In conclusion, while high-rise apartment living presents several advantages, including efficient land use and enhanced security, it also comes with its set of challenges, such as reduced privacy and dependency on mechanical systems. Ultimately, the decision to live in a high-rise apartment should be based on an individual's priorities and lifestyle, weighing the benefits against the drawbacks to make an informed decision.
789;Many people now undertake extreme activities, from hang-gliding to mountain climbing.Why do people risk their lives in this way, and do you think this is a good trend?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Extreme sports, such as mountain climbing and hand-gliding, have become increasingly popular over the past several decades. Now more than ever, athletes can be paid to do these activities full-time, encouraging more aspiring athletes to enter extreme sports. In addition, the addictive nature of these activities means that participants tend to stay in the sport for the thrill. While the increased popularity can result in more accidents, it can also make the sports safer as atheletes collectively learn from past mistakes.While people have undertaken extreme activities long before the advent of television and social media, these new platforms give extreme sports the much needed sponsorship and attention. Nowadays, outlandish and dangerous acts can be televised and monetized, giving the athletes a way to make a living out of these events. Therefore, more people would feel encouraged to participate in these activities knowing that they can have a decent income. On top of the external motivation, most extreme athletes take part in these sports because they are thrilling and addicting. These atheletes chase the rush and validation that they get when doing dangerous activities. As a result, even without the external rewards, some people would still partake in these sports.Given that people are motivated both internally and externally to participate in extreme sports, it is inevitable that these activities become more popular. While it is true that increased participation would result in more accidents, it would also create more lessons for future participants. In this way, these accidents and injuries would help educate future athletes on how to protect themselves. Moreoever, this increased popularity would also encourage governments to draft more safety regulations.In conclusion, given that it is human nature to want to achieve feats of strength and courage, extreme sports would always be attractive for some. Because of this, there will always be people injuring themselves while pursuing these feats. Therefore, these activities would become safer the more athletes learn from past incidents.;The trend of undertaking extreme activities has gained significant popularity in recent years. Many individuals are now engaging in high-risk pursuits such as hang-gliding, bungee jumping, and mountain climbing. But why do people deliberately put their lives at risk in this way? In my opinion, this phenomenon can be attributed to the human desire for adrenaline and the need for personal challenge.One reason people participate in extreme activities is the thrill and sense of accomplishment they derive from overcoming fear and pushing their physical limits. For instance, mountain climbers often report feeling an overwhelming sense of pride and satisfaction upon reaching the summit, which motivates them to take on even more daunting challenges. Additionally, the adrenaline rush associated with extreme sports can be highly addictive, leading individuals to seek out increasingly intense experiences.While some may view this trend as reckless and foolhardy, I believe it can have positive effects when approached with caution and proper training. Extreme activities can foster a sense of community and camaraderie among participants, as well as promote mental and physical well-being. For example, rock climbing can improve strength, flexibility, and problem-solving skills, while also teaching valuable lessons about perseverance and risk management.However, it is essential to acknowledge the potential risks involved and take necessary precautions to minimize harm. With proper equipment, guidance, and safety protocols in place, the risks associated with extreme activities can be significantly mitigated. Ultimately, I believe that this trend can be beneficial when approached responsibly, as it allows individuals to challenge themselves, build confidence, and experience the thrill of adventure. By embracing this trend with caution and respect, we can harness its potential to promote personal growth and well-being.
1345;Many people support animal testing while others believe it isn’t appropriate (discuss);Many people support use of animals for testing medicines for humans. Others believe it isn’t appropriate to use animals for such experiments. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayApproval of the medicines for human use is a tedious process which involves a series of tests often performed on animals. While some people support this idea because it makes drugs safer for human consumption, others believe that it is an unethical practice. Personally, I am in favour of the idea that medicines should be tested in all possible scenarios before being released to the public.Those against animal experimentation argue that animals have the same rights as human beings because they are the outcome of the same evolution process through which humans came into existence. Infecting them with viruses and exposing them to bacteria, to create a conducive environment to test a chemical substance may cause excruciating pain to these lab animals. Any failed test can mean that the subject either loses its precious life or suffers for the rest of its existence, and understandably, some people are against what they consider an immoral practice.Nonetheless, if a drug is released into the market without a thorough end-to-end testing, it could cause severe damage to anyone who may consume it. Every day a large number of animals are being mercilessly killed by humans for their mere flesh and skin. There isn’t a big difference between killing an animal for food and sacrificing its life for testing a chemical composition, because both actions are helping the human race to survive. What’s more, the life of one animal used to test a life-saving drug could help many people live. This is why a large number of people believe that testing drugs on animals is a matter of survival.To sum up, there are valid reasons why animal testing seems cruel and unacceptable to some, and crucial to others. In my opinion, even though animals subjected to testing may suffer, it is a necessary step to ensure the healing power of a drug.;The debate over animal testing has sparked intense discussion among individuals with differing opinions. On one hand, many people support animal testing, citing its benefits in advancing medical research and ensuring the safety of new drugs and products. They argue that animal testing is a necessary step in the development of life-saving treatments and cures for diseases. For instance, the development of the polio vaccine was made possible through animal testing, and it has saved countless lives. Additionally, animal testing allows researchers to test the efficacy and potential side effects of new treatments in a controlled environment, reducing the risk of harm to humans.On the other hand, many people believe that animal testing is not appropriate, citing concerns about animal welfare and the ethics of using living creatures for scientific experimentation. They argue that animals are sentient beings with the capacity to feel pain, suffer, and experience emotional distress, and that it is morally wrong to subject them to experimentation. Furthermore, with the advancement of technology, alternative methods such as in vitro testing and computer simulations are becoming increasingly available, reducing the need for animal testing. Moreover, many animal tests have been shown to be unreliable and do not accurately predict human responses, which undermines their usefulness in medical research.In conclusion, while some people support animal testing due to its perceived benefits in advancing medical research, others believe it is not appropriate due to concerns about animal welfare and ethics. However, as technology continues to advance, it is likely that alternative methods will become more prevalent, reducing the need for animal testing. Ultimately, a balanced approach that takes into account both the benefits and the drawbacks of animal testing is necessary to ensure that medical research is conducted in a responsible and ethical manner.
327;Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. Do you agree or disagree?;It is undeniable that nowadays, smart devices such as phones and tablets play an essential role in one's life. Through countless websites and applications, people can connect with each other without any boundaries. While many people agree that the introduction of these technologies has many disadvantages to the conservative way of starting and maintaining relationships, I personally believe that they rather develop new socializing methods.First and foremost, social medias and applications can help with keeping in touch with acquintances. Previously, people had to follow a precise time and location to meet up with their friends as they are unable to contact the others to reschedule. However, the internet allows them to update their plans at any time. This means that if there is any emergency, an individual can immediately postpone the upcoming event and find the next available slot to continue the plan. Furthermore, there are several applications that allow people to video call their friends and family who are currently living apart.The current technologies not only offer us options to communicate with our current contacts but also allow us to discover new friends. In the past, it is difficult to find people with a common interest which had to be done through social events. Nowadays, online communities enable their users to connect with new friends virtually. Thus, fewer individuals are left alone, especially introverts and those who are living in remote areas which can have difficulties socializing offline.All in all, despite the fact that there are many positive impacts of the invention of social medias and communication technologies, there are also risks and downsides of using them without face-to-face communication. Therefore, the time used for socializing online and offline should always be balanced.;The advent of modern communication technology has revolutionized the way people interact with each other. While it has made communication faster and more convenient, many argue that it has negative effects on social relationships. I agree with this viewpoint.On one hand, modern communication technology, such as social media and messaging apps, has made it easier for people to connect with each other across geographical distances. However, this has also led to a decline in face-to-face interactions, which are essential for building and maintaining meaningful relationships. People are now more likely to spend hours scrolling through their social media feeds rather than engaging in conversations with family and friends.Moreover, modern communication technology can also create a false sense of connection. People may have hundreds of online friends, but lack genuine, deep relationships. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation, even in the midst of a crowded online community. Furthermore, the constant stream of information on social media can also create unrealistic expectations and promote consumerism, leading to a sense of dissatisfaction and disconnection from others.In conclusion, while modern communication technology has many benefits, I believe that it has negative effects on social relationships. The decline of face-to-face interactions, the creation of a false sense of connection, and the promotion of unrealistic expectations are all significant drawbacks. To maintain healthy social relationships, it is essential to strike a balance between technology use and in-person interactions. By being aware of these potential negative effects, we can use modern communication technology in a way that complements, rather than harms, our social relationships.
837;Many people today, especially in the developed world, are choosing to have fewer children, or none at all.Why is this happening, and do you think it is a good trend?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Weather to have children or not is one of the most important questions young adults have to ask themselfs nowadays. Overpopulation is one of the many global problems next to climate change, and poverty.In my opinion, the need to have children roots back to us being nothing more, but civilised animals. Animals have one goal above all; reproduce. This is why in many cultures, men and women who cannot have chlidren are seen as disabled, or sick. Nowadays, modern values changed our perspective, having children is often seen as a necessity for a happy, and successful life.It is important to recognise the problems the developed world faces. There is smoke in the air, plastic pollution everywhere, poverty in third world countries, and many other factors that make Earth a terrible place for many. Above all, the life we give birth to will have to eat, drink, and consume just like everyone else, using more and more of the already limited resources, generating more and more trash.Many people argue that the above mentioned points are a pessimistic and unrealistic. Humans have to reproduce, to keep the species from extintion. And truthfully the only way to do that, is to give birth as many kids as possible. This issue lies deep in our society; here in Hungary, a family is rewared almost 30000 USD if they have 3 or more kids. This means that many people have children because they get money for it, and they are also seen socially accepted.I believe modern day intelligence goes further than IQ points and money earned. We have to recognise the problems created, overpopulation being one of them. While I do not believe that we should not have kids, I think there should be careful planning involved and self-reflection before giving birth to new life.";The trend of having fewer children or none at all is becoming increasingly prevalent in the developed world. One of the primary reasons for this phenomenon is the rising cost of living and the financial burden of raising children. In many countries, the cost of education, healthcare, and childcare is substantial, making it challenging for parents to balance their finances. As a result, many individuals are opting to have fewer children or remain childless to maintain their economic stability.Another significant factor contributing to this trend is the shift in societal values and priorities. With the advancement of women's rights and gender equality, many women are now pursuing careers and personal goals, which often take precedence over starting a family. Additionally, the increasing availability of birth control methods and family planning resources has empowered individuals to make informed choices about their reproductive health.While some may view this trend as negative, I believe it has its advantages. For instance, having fewer children can lead to a better quality of life for both the parents and the child. Parents can devote more time, resources, and attention to their children, resulting in a more stable and nurturing environment. Moreover, countries with low birth rates, such as Japan and Italy, are experiencing a rise in investments in education and childcare, leading to a more skilled and educated workforce.In conclusion, the trend of having fewer children or none at all is a complex issue with multiple factors at play. While it may have its drawbacks, such as concerns about population decline and aging societies, I believe it also has its benefits. Ultimately, the decision to have children or not is a personal choice, and individuals should be empowered to make informed decisions about their reproductive health and family planning.
1317;Many people try to achieve a work-life balance but fail. Why is this happening? What can be done to help people overcome this problem?;Many people strive to achieve a work-life balance, but often find themselves failing despite their best efforts. This is not surprising, as balancing work and life commitments can be extremely difficult due to both having their unique stressors.One of the major reasons why so many people struggle to achieve harmony between their personal and professional lives is that now it is easier than ever for people to stay connected outside of regular work hours. This has led to an expectation that employees should always be available, and they risk being seen as unreliable or uncommitted if they are not. A knock-on effect of longer working hours is that little time is left for leisure activities such as socialising or engaging in hobbies or sports, which help reduce stress levels and improve overall well-being. This type of pressure and lack of free time can lead to feelings of burnout, with no respite from life’s pressures, resulting in chronic fatigue and diminished motivation over time.Helping those struggling to find a suitable work-life balance will require joint efforts of managers and employees. Workers, for instance, need to recognise the importance of taking regular breaks throughout the day and getting enough sleep each night, while employers should consider being more flexible when it comes to allowing staff to work remotely and offering paid vacation days. This will give employees space, both mentally and physically, enabling them to better manage their commitments without overextending themselves.In conclusion, achieving a successful work-life balance is something that many cannot quite reach due to external pressures from employers and a lack of downtime. However, these issues can be overcome, if we create realistic boundaries between our professional lives and personal goals, and make conscious decisions about how we want to spend our time.;"The concept of work-life balance has become a pressing concern for many individuals in today's fast-paced world. Despite the efforts to achieve a balance between professional and personal life, many people struggle to succeed. One of the primary reasons for this failure is the increasing demands of the workplace. With the advancement of technology, employers often expect employees to be available 24/7, leading to an overlap between work and personal life.Another significant factor contributing to the difficulty in achieving work-life balance is the lack of effective time management skills. Many individuals find it challenging to prioritize their tasks, leading to an imbalance between work and personal responsibilities. Furthermore, societal pressure to constantly perform and achieve can also lead to an overemphasis on work, causing individuals to neglect their personal well-being.To overcome this problem, individuals can take several steps. Firstly, they can establish clear boundaries between their work and personal life, such as designating specific work hours and avoiding work-related activities during personal time. Additionally, effective time management skills, such as prioritizing tasks and learning to say ""no"" to non-essential work commitments, can help individuals allocate sufficient time for personal activities. Employers can also play a crucial role by promoting flexible work arrangements, as flexible hours and telecommuting can help employees manage their work and personal responsibilities more efficiently. Ultimately, achieving a work-life balance requires a conscious effort from both individuals and employers. By recognizing the importance of personal well-being and taking steps to prioritize it, individuals can overcome the challenges of achieving a balance between their work and personal life, leading to a more fulfilling and sustainable lifestyle."
1298;Many schoolchildren today take part in work experience sessions for short periods of time instead of attending school. Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It has been a popular trend for some time now to put children into what can be called ‘work experience placements’. The children are taken out of school and take part in various types of work, usually for around a week. Some people criticise this trend, but I can’t see how it can be a negative experience.One of the criticisms is that children lose a week of schoolwork. With the pressure to do well at school increasing, children need every bit of help to maximise their potential. Taking them out of the school, it is therefore argued, stops them from getting access to needed education for a whole week. As the students won’t really be of much help to a workplace for just one week, it would therefore be better for them to remain at school.While this is a valid point, taking a child’s entire experience of school into account, a single week away does not make a significant difference. Indeed, if the timing of the week’s work placements is done correctly, the week can also serve as a kind of ‘holiday’ away from school, something that is regularly needed in order to allow students to remain fresh and enthusiastic. In many work placements, children also get to see some of things they learn at school put into a realistic context, allowing them to understand the relevance of what they learn and thereby creating a way to reinforce the learning.In addition to this, schoolchildren can be quite nervous about the world of work that they will have to join at some point in their lives. By getting this short taste of what it is like, they can see that it is nothing to be scared about. As well as this, children will often have some ideas of what they want to do for a living, but are not sure. By allowing them to see a type of work they are considering, they are better able to decide whether that career could be suitable for them.I feel, therefore, that work placements can be seen as a positive development. Missing a short amount of school is not serious and the benefits that can be gained from the placements are significant.;The trend of schoolchildren participating in work experience sessions instead of attending school has sparked a debate about its impact. In my opinion, this development is largely positive. One of the primary advantages of work experience is that it provides students with hands-on, practical skills and exposure to real-world work environments. This can be particularly beneficial for students who are unsure about their future career paths, as it allows them to explore different fields and gain valuable insight.Moreover, work experience sessions can help students develop essential life skills such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. By working in a professional setting, students learn to take responsibility, manage their time effectively, and work under pressure. For instance, a student who participates in a work experience program at a hospital may gain experience in patient care, medical terminology, and hospital administration. This can be invaluable in helping them decide whether a career in healthcare is right for them.Another benefit of work experience is that it can enhance a student's employability after graduation. Many employers view work experience as a valuable asset, and it can give students a competitive edge in the job market. Additionally, work experience can also provide students with a network of professional contacts, which can be useful for future job opportunities or recommendations.However, some may argue that work experience sessions take away from academic time, potentially impacting a student's grades or understanding of key concepts. Nevertheless, if structured properly, work experience can complement academic learning, providing students with a more comprehensive education. In conclusion, the incorporation of work experience sessions into a student's curriculum is a positive development, offering numerous benefits that can shape their future careers and personal growth. By providing practical skills, life experience, and employability, work experience is an invaluable opportunity that can set students up for success.
1413;Millions of people every year move to English- speaking countries such as Australia, Britain or America, in order to study at school, college or university. Why do so many people want to study in English? Why is English such an important international language?;Nowadays, language becomes a major factor to . Many people prefer to study abroad English-speaking country because English is an international language. There is no doubt that the best way to improve the English language skill is to use the English language daily so if people study in English speaking countries, their will be improved automatically and it will give them some advantages such as work in many countries or they will be to many different places without studying other languages. This essay will describe in detail why English is an important international language.Firstly, the English language is widely used in many countries and at present, the world traders are currently developing rapidly. In order to compete with people from different countries, it is to be able to communicate the English language. For example, China has been improving a lot in many sectors. They are able to compete with other countries because many people in China English language and they are trying hard to study English.Secondly, many companies prefer to employ people who can speak English because if the companies create new in different countries, the employers are able to move the new branch without new people and the branch company is still able to communicate with the central company. In fact, one of the largest companies in the world (Google) has created some in different countries and each of the Google is able to discuss things or otherwise communicate even though they are in different countries because they all use English to communicate.In conclusion, many people move to English speaking countries for further studies because they believe that it will improve their English skills and in order to become a successful person in the future, mastering English is .;The allure of English-speaking countries has become a magnet for millions of students worldwide, drawing them to renowned institutions in Australia, Britain, and America. The primary reason behind this massive migration is the prestige and opportunities associated with studying in English. English has emerged as the lingua franca of international communication, enabling individuals to connect with people from diverse backgrounds and cultures.One significant factor contributing to English's importance is its widespread use in business, science, and technology. Major multinational corporations, research institutions, and scientific communities operate primarily in English, making it an essential tool for professional advancement. Studying in English provides students with a competitive edge, equipping them with the language skills necessary to excel in their chosen fields and interact with global peers.Furthermore, the internet and digital media have reinforced English's dominance, with the majority of online content and resources available in English. This has created a vast, easily accessible repository of knowledge, which students can tap into by acquiring proficiency in the language. As a result, English has become the key to unlocking a world of information, innovation, and collaboration.In conclusion, the massive influx of students to English-speaking countries can be attributed to the language's unparalleled importance in modern society. By studying in English, individuals can gain a profound understanding of their subject matter, enhance their career prospects, and become active participants in the global exchange of ideas. As English continues to evolve as the premier international language, its allure is likely to endure, drawing scholars and professionals from around the world to the esteemed institutions of English-speaking nations.
795;Missions to explore space are hugely expensive, and there are problems on Earth which demand attention. The number of these missions needs to be reduced.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is supposed by many, that high-cost space studies should be cut off while more focus should be paid to the challenges mankind face on Earth. This essay completely disargees with such view because of two reasons that will de developed further.The first reason is that only rich countries spend thier budgets for space studies. This means that only when states have resolved most of their problems with poverty, level of medicine treatment, safety, they can divert some of the funds to invest in future technologies. Moreover, citizens will go on a strike and make the govenment to deal with real life problems instead of dreaming about the space. For example, not more than 5% of USA GDP is spent on space programs that is sufficient to progress, construct new sputniks, and send astronauts to the Internations Space Station.The second argument supposes that many space technologies have a dual puropose. In other words, being initially developed for studing the space, they were adopted to make people's day-to-day life easier. For example, mobile phones and the mobile Internet, navigaion using GPS would not be possibe if people were not trying to explore space.In conclusion, new technologies are developed when people are trying to learn the world outside our planet. This;I disagree with the statement that the number of space exploration missions needs to be reduced. While it is true that space missions are costly and there are pressing problems on Earth that require attention, the benefits of space exploration far outweigh the costs. Space research has led to numerous breakthroughs and innovations that have improved our daily lives, including GPS technology, memory foam, and water purification systems.Moreover, space exploration has the potential to provide solutions to some of the world's most pressing problems, such as climate change and resource depletion. For example, the NASA's Earth Observing System has been instrumental in monitoring climate patterns and providing valuable data for scientists to study and develop strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change. Additionally, space agencies such as the European Space Agency have been working on developing sustainable technologies for resource management, such as more efficient irrigation systems and drought monitoring.Reducing the number of space missions would be a shortsighted decision, as it would hinder our ability to make new discoveries and develop innovative solutions to global problems. Instead, governments and space agencies should prioritize and optimize their resources to ensure that space missions are conducted in a cost-effective and efficient manner. This could involve collaborating with private companies, sharing resources, and focusing on missions that have the greatest potential to benefit humanity. For instance, the partnership between NASA and private companies such as SpaceX has led to significant cost savings and innovations in space technology. In conclusion, while there are problems on Earth that demand attention, the benefits of space exploration make it an essential investment for the future of humanity.

Therefore, I firmly believe that modern medicine plays a vital role in enabling people to live longer, healthier lives.
1315;More and more people today are drinking sugar-based drinks. Why is this happening? What measures can be taken to reverse this trend?;An alarming number of people today consume sugar-based drinks, whether it is in the form of soda, energy drinks or fruit drinks. Often consumers are lured by their widespread availability and convenience, however, marketing campaigns also play a role, targeting young people and giving them the perception that sugary drinks are not as unhealthy as they actually are.The availability of these types of drinks has greatly increased over time. They can now be found in almost any store or restaurant, which makes them easily accessible to almost anyone. The fact that they are often cheaper than alternatives, such as water or freshly squeezed juice, makes them an especially attractive option for those on a budget. Marketing campaigns for sugary beverages have been quite successful in creating positive associations attached to these products through advertisements on TV and billboards. This encourages people to consider them fun rather than unhealthy and normalises them within society.Luckily, reversing the rise in popularity of sugary drinks is still possible, if we act now and attack the problem from different angles. One of the very first steps should be educating people on the health risks associated with high sugar intake so that they can make better-informed decisions when selecting what type of beverage they consume. Companies should also be held accountable by law for their misleading marketing campaigns aimed at children and teenagers who are more likely to believe the false claims about their products’ health benefits without fully understanding what’s being sold to them. Schools, colleges and universities, and any institutions catering for young people, should consider banning sugary drinks and replacing them with refreshing alternatives without added sugar.Overall, it is important that we recognise the potential health risks posed by consuming too much sugar from soft drinks and take actionable steps towards reversing this trend in order to ensure our long-term wellbeing. Through greater education, government regulation, and increased corporate responsibility we can ensure that more people understand why reducing their intake of sugary beverages is important while still allowing them to access enjoyable yet healthier options.;The prevalence of sugar-based drinks has become a pressing concern in recent years, with an increasing number of people consuming these beverages on a daily basis. One of the primary reasons for this trend is the widespread availability and marketing of sugary drinks. They are easily accessible in stores, restaurants, and vending machines, making them a convenient option for many individuals. Furthermore, the clever marketing strategies employed by beverage companies, such as attractive packaging and enticing advertisements, have contributed to their popularity, particularly among young people.Another factor contributing to the trend is the lack of awareness about the detrimental health effects associated with the consumption of sugar-based drinks. Many people are unaware of the link between sugary drinks and various health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay. As a result, they continue to consume these beverages without considering the potential risks to their health.To reverse this trend, several measures can be taken. Firstly, governments and health organizations can launch public awareness campaigns to educate people about the negative health effects of sugary drinks. Additionally, beverage companies can be encouraged to reduce the sugar content in their products and offer healthier alternatives. Taxes can also be imposed on sugary drinks to make them less appealing to consumers. Moreover, schools and workplaces can promote healthy drinking habits by providing access to clean water and other low-sugar beverages. By implementing these measures, it is possible to reduce the consumption of sugar-based drinks and promote a healthier lifestyle among individuals. Ultimately, it requires a collective effort from governments, organizations, and individuals to reverse the trend and foster a healthier drinking culture.
1259;More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Over the past decades, it has been registered a considerable decrease in the percentage of people eager to create a family at a young age. There could be different reasons for this and I am going to state them clearly in the following paragraphs, which will also explain why I believe the advantages of this situation far outweigh the disadvantages.Apparently, the society we currently live in has undergone substantial changes over the years, sometimes without us even noticing it. The most evident of these variations has probably been the gradual rise in the number of old people as opposed to the dramatic fall in the number of births. In fact, owing to the decline of the economy of most nations and the subsequent reduction of work opportunities, more and more people are giving up on the idea of becoming parents in their 20s or 30s. Many people see this as a negative aspect for our society; however, I have to strongly disagree with their opinion.The drawbacks to which a lot of people point out when discussing about these kind of topics often has to do with the age gap between parents and their children. Admittedly, someone cannot decide to have a child in their 40s without considering the significant generation gap that would separate them from their kids and, as a result, the issues of miscommunication that could arise.However, the disadvantages become of secondary importance as soon as the much more remarkable benefits are examined. First of all, older parents also means more responsible and mature caretakers; consequently, due to their broader life experience, they would arguably make better advisors for their kids. Not to mention that older parents would not only have more stable and secure jobs, but they would also have more consistent savings to devote to their children's further education, which in turn could help the latter having a better and well-paid job in the future.To conclude, although it's impossible not to take into account the drawbacks of having a child at a more advanced age, the advantages still outrun the disadvantages. Thus, children would be the first to benefit from such a situation.";In recent years, there has been a noticeable shift in the trend of family planning, with more people opting to have children at a later stage in life. This phenomenon can be attributed to various factors, including career advancement, financial stability, and personal maturity. Many individuals now prioritize establishing their careers and securing a stable financial foundation before taking on the responsibilities of parenthood.One of the primary advantages of having children at an older age is the increased financial security, which enables parents to provide a more stable and comfortable environment for their children. For instance, a couple in their mid-30s is likely to have a higher combined income and better career prospects, allowing them to invest in their child's education and well-being. Additionally, older parents tend to be more emotionally mature, which can lead to more effective parenting and a more nurturing environment.However, there are also some disadvantages to consider. Older parents may have less energy to keep up with their children, and there is also a higher risk of health problems associated with advanced maternal and paternal age. Nevertheless, in my opinion, the advantages of having children at an older age outweigh the disadvantages. With the advancement in medical technology and the increasing life expectancy, the risks associated with older parenthood can be mitigated. Moreover, the benefits of financial security, emotional maturity, and life experience can have a profoundly positive impact on a child's upbringing and development. Ultimately, the decision of when to have children is a personal one, but for many, delaying parenthood until later in life can be a wise and rewarding choice.
1425;Most high level positions in companies are filled by men, even though the workforce in many developed countries consists of 50 percent female workers. Companies should be required to allocate a certain percentage of management positions to women. Discuss, what is your opinion?;"The inequality between men and women has always been a significant issue in society. , it is undeniable that most vital positions in companies are taken by males, not females. Therefore, that companies should allocate to women a certain number of these positions. However, I do not agree with this requirement completely.In some feudal countries, it was true to say that the society the males, and at that time instances of inequality occurred very frequently. Up until the present moment, it in some developing countries; also it is greatly . A large number of women in these countries are not allowed to go to work or even go to . In this case, this is not an individual issue, but social problem. The governments should have some solution to this tendency, and at the same time they should promulgate a new legislation to protect women’s .On the other hand, the global economy is developing rapidly nowadays. In most corporations, distinguish men from women; they only focus on working efficiently. In this world, any employees who possess enough abilities and work in an effective way, be promoted to positions. Therefore, allocating the high level positions in companies to women is not necessary. Moreover, the instances of women in essential positions . Those women are very successful in their work and their lives.In conclusion, although the inequality between men and women has reduced, it still is a social issue worth . Personally, in my opinion we should create as many opportunities for women to have an equal life as we can.";The underrepresentation of women in high-level positions within companies is a pervasive issue that persists in many developed countries. Despite comprising 50 percent of the workforce, women are significantly underrepresented in management and executive roles. In my opinion, requiring companies to allocate a certain percentage of management positions to women is a necessary step towards achieving greater gender equality in the workplace.This measure would help to address the systemic barriers and biases that prevent women from advancing to leadership positions. Currently, many companies operate with unconscious biases, and women often face discrimination and stereotypes that hinder their career progression. By introducing quotas, companies would be forced to re-examine their recruitment and promotion practices, ensuring that women have equal opportunities to compete for top positions.Moreover, introducing quotas would bring numerous benefits to companies, including access to a broader talent pool, increased diversity of perspectives, and enhanced decision-making. Women bring unique experiences, skills, and insights to the table, which can lead to more innovative and effective business strategies. By tapping into this talent, companies can improve their performance and competitiveness.However, it is essential to implement such a policy carefully, to avoid tokenism and ensure that women are appointed based on merit, rather than just to fill a quota. Companies should focus on creating a supportive and inclusive work environment, providing training and development opportunities, and addressing the underlying biases that prevent women from advancing.In conclusion, requiring companies to allocate a certain percentage of management positions to women is a necessary step towards achieving greater gender equality in the workplace. It would help to address the systemic barriers that prevent women from advancing, bring numerous benefits to companies, and ultimately lead to more diverse and effective leadership.
1390;News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in a newspaper. What factors do you think influence their decisions? Do we become used to bad news? Would it be better if more good news was reported?;. There are two factors that influence their decisions. The first is the kind of customers they aim at. each kind of readers and watchers has its own features. For example, if your customers are almost entirely teenagers, you have to concentrate on something attracting them such as stories, photographs of singer stars, film stars, funny tales, and fashion. It be very silly if you to provide teenagers with economic or news. On the contrary, and politicians may never read news about James Blunt or Keira Knightley. Therefore, what influences news editors’ decisions the most is the taste of their customers.The second factor is how hot and attractive the news is. Who or watch news from a year or a month ago or even about something that happened last week? The answer is . In the energetic and competitive world nowadays, people always ask for a really news. So that to satisfy customers, there is a pressure on all editors to find continually what has already happened not only yesterday but even an hour ago. Or else, they may lose their customers. None of editors wants that bleak future.The type of news is also an important consideration. Whether on television or in newspapers, we seem to get more of and become used to bad news. It is harder for us to come across a piece of good news. We can’t deny that bad things happen on Earth day by day. However, news editors try to gain more and more , which means more and more money, using bad news as a magnet. bad news makes us curious. We want to know why it is bad, what it is about, whether it influences us or not. As a result, we will buy newspapers or watch television to find out. And the happiest people are, of course, news editors.In my view it would be better if more good news reported. Bad news makes us good news makes us happy. There should an an equal amount of good and bad news. In that way we can give something bad a lot of thought while still being happy about the good news. Any inequalities between good news and bad news should be avoided. Nowadays we cannot live without news, and for that reason the role of news editors became very important. We should support them, and in turn they should try their best to provide us with useful news, both good and bad.;The role of news editors is crucial in shaping the information that reaches the masses through television and print media. Several factors influence their decisions on what to broadcast or print. Firstly, the relevance and impact of a story on the audience play a significant role. Editors tend to prioritize stories that are likely to generate high viewer or reader engagement, such as scandals, conflicts, or natural disasters. Additionally, the availability of resources, including time, personnel, and budget, also affects the selection of news stories. Another significant factor is the commercial aspect, where the potential to attract advertisers and boost ratings can sway editorial decisions. The competition among news outlets further intensifies the pressure to break stories first, which sometimes leads to the prioritization of sensationalism over in-depth, quality reporting. As a result, bad news often dominates the headlines, as it tends to be more attention-grabbing and commercially viable. Prolonged exposure to predominantly negative news can desensitize audiences, leading to a phenomenon where we become accustomed to bad news. This can have profound psychological effects, contributing to increased stress, anxiety, and a pessimistic outlook on life. Conversely, reporting more good news could foster a more balanced and optimistic view of the world. It could inspire positive change by highlighting successful initiatives, heroic acts, and stories of resilience and hope. Moreover, good news stories can motivate individuals and communities to emulate positive behaviors and work towards creating a better society. In conclusion, while the factors influencing news editors' decisions are complex and multifaceted, there is a compelling case for reporting more good news. By doing so, news outlets can contribute to a more informed, inspired, and resilient public, ultimately enhancing the well-being of individuals and communities. A balanced approach to news reporting, incorporating both the necessary coverage of critical issues and the uplifting stories of human achievement and kindness, is essential for a healthy and functioning society.
1321;Newspapers have a significant influence on people’s ideas and opinions. Why is this happening? Is it a positive or negative situation?;Many people believe that newspapers play a pivotal role in shaping the way we think. There are numerous ways in which this affects our society, and I believe that this influence is mostly negative.Newspapers have long been a source of valuable information that has kept societies abreast of the latest happenings in the world. Since the average citizen has minimal knowledge about the information in expert analysis articles, well-established newspapers are powerfully poised to form public opinion through attention-grabbing images and carefully worded commentary. This leaves the reader no choice but to trust the accuracy of what they have read.Sadly, unbiased objectivity, which used to be the core idea behind journalism, seems to be a thing of the past. The arrival and spread of social media platforms has caused a gradual decline in print media subscriptions and their circulation, since readers tend to favor the internet and social media to stay informed about current affairs. This gave rise to a worrying trend of newspapers using sensationalist and controversial tactics to improve their sales. As a result, the constant barrage of bad news has led to a society that sees itself as more vulnerable and powerless than ever. To make matters worse, there are plenty of well-documented instances where newspapers have been used to spread false propaganda which is usually politically motivated.All in all, although newspapers are our lifeline to the world around us, the recent trend of publishing misinformation has had a mostly negative impact on readers. It is my hope that newspapers will go back to publishing impartial accounts of the latest news in the future.;The advent of newspapers has revolutionized the way people consume information, and it is undeniable that they have a profound influence on shaping people's ideas and opinions. This phenomenon occurs due to several reasons. Firstly, newspapers provide a platform for diverse perspectives and opinions, which exposes readers to a wide range of viewpoints, thereby broadening their understanding of various issues. Additionally, newspapers often feature in-depth analysis and editorials that offer insightful commentary on current events, which can sway readers' opinions and influence their decision-making.The influence of newspapers can be both positive and negative. On the positive side, newspapers play a crucial role in promoting awareness and education among the masses. They provide a platform for marginalized voices to be heard and bring attention to social and political issues that might otherwise be overlooked. Furthermore, newspapers can foster critical thinking and encourage readers to engage in constructive debates and discussions.However, the influence of newspapers can also be negative if they perpetuate biased or sensationalized reporting. This can lead to the spread of misinformation, reinforce existing prejudices, and create unnecessary panic or hysteria. Moreover, the concentration of newspaper ownership in the hands of a few individuals or corporations can result in a homogenization of opinions and stifle diversity of thought.In conclusion, the significant influence of newspapers on people's ideas and opinions is a complex issue with both positive and negative implications. While newspapers have the potential to educate, inform, and promote critical thinking, they also risk perpetuating biases and misinformation. Ultimately, it is essential for readers to approach newspaper content with a critical eye, recognizing both the benefits and limitations of this influential medium. By doing so, we can harness the positive potential of newspapers to foster informed and engaged citizens.
1391;Nowadays environmental problems are too big to be managed by individual persons or individual countries. In other words, it is an international problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;An essential problem of the 21st century is world pollution. Currently the environment is so contaminated that urgent measures should be taken. A single individual cannot be blamed for the world pollution, however every person should take care of his or her habitat. In addition, it is vital that environmental issues are treated internationally.Lately, many presentations, conferences and international summits are held to deal with waste treatment, recycling, and soil and water contamination. joint efforts and consolidation can only help in the mutual war the ongoing environmental disaster. For instance, governments should offer support to companies and organizations, involved in manufacturing, industry or agriculture in order to find environment-friendly approaches. These could be special law regulations, recycling programs, helping courses in order to implement ISO certificates and many more.However, the influence of individuals over environment should not be ignored. If we do not that our planet is our home, we will never be able to take care of it. We have to contribute every day to the preservation of nature and environment. For example, always remember to save energy by switching off lamps, computers and everything that we do not use. Our next obligation is to separate waste and throw bulk only in the designated areas. Driving vehicles can also be environment friendly. For example, we have to avoid accelerating the engines too rapidly or using the air conditioning in the country, where it would be better to save energy and simply open the windows.To sum up, environmental problems should be handled by local and international authorities as well as individuals. Every single person should take care of the environment, moreover we have to bring up our children to be conscious citizens of a clean and preserved planet.;The notion that environmental problems have transcended individual and national boundaries, necessitating a collective global response, is a sentiment that resonates deeply with the current state of ecological affairs. I strongly agree with the assertion that environmental issues have evolved into an international problem, requiring concerted efforts from the global community.On one hand, the interconnectedness of the world's ecosystems underscores the need for a unified approach to tackling environmental challenges. Climate change, for instance, is a quintessential international problem, as greenhouse gas emissions from one country can have far-reaching consequences on global weather patterns, affecting multiple nations simultaneously. Similarly, the pollution of oceans, which knows no borders, has become a pressing international concern, with plastic waste and harmful chemicals contaminating marine life and impacting coastal ecosystems worldwide.On the other hand, individual countries, despite their best efforts, are limited in their capacity to address these issues alone. The implementation of national policies and regulations can only go so far in mitigating the effects of environmental degradation when the problem's scope is inherently global. Furthermore, the economic and technological resources required to combat environmental problems effectively often exceed the capabilities of individual nations, especially those that are less economically developed.Therefore, it is imperative that the international community comes together to share knowledge, technologies, and financial resources to combat environmental problems. International agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, and global initiatives aimed at reducing emissions, protecting biodiversity, and promoting sustainable development, are crucial steps in the right direction. In conclusion, given the transboundary nature of environmental challenges and the limitations of solo national efforts, it is undeniable that environmental problems are indeed too big to be managed by individual persons or countries alone, necessitating a collaborative global response.
1368;Nowadays families move to different countries for work and some think it has a negative effect on children (agree/disagree);Nowadays families move to different countries for work. Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Recent advancements, in technology and transportation in particular, are reshaping our world in an unprecedented manner. Nowadays, it is not unusual for people to work abroad. Most expatriates relocate their families to the countries . Some people argue that this phenomenon negatively affects children, however, I agree with those who believe the opposite is true.Those who think that relocating children to a new place is undesirable do so for many reasons. Their most common argument is the negative impact of moving on a child’s personality. There is no doubt that living in a different community comes with its challenges, especially to young people, as they get exposed to behaviours, actions and customs they might not be familiar with. As a result, children could possibly feel a lack of stability and some confusion. It is also likely that their patriotic feelings and sense of belonging to their home country could weaken as they would miss many opportunities to celebrate their national events.Nevertheless, I firmly believe that opinion to be ludicrous, as it seems that getting exposed to a new culture is beneficial in many ways. It fosters young social and emotional capabilities. Moreover, children living abroad have better opportunities to and practice new languages. Mastering more than one language improves not only their intellectual development, but also their opportunities in acquiring better jobs in the future. According to a recent study published by the University of Chicago, competency in more than one language increases employment chances on average by 200%.In conclusion, I strongly believe that living in a different country positively affects children in all aspects. Acquiring new languages, and an open minded and tolerant personality are just few examples of the many possible benefits.This essay presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt. The writer’s ideas are relevant and well‐supported. The arrangement of information and use of cohesive devices are fine, perhaps with a slight overuse in the second body paragraph. Sentence structures are complex, and the vocabulary is varied and appropriately used, except for some minor grammatical/spelling mistakes. This essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;The phenomenon of families relocating to different countries for work has become increasingly common in today's globalized world. While some argue that this has a negative impact on children, I firmly disagree. In fact, I believe that such experiences can have numerous benefits for children.On the one hand, moving to a new country can be challenging for children, as they have to adapt to a new environment, a new school, and make new friends. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and disorientation. However, these difficulties can be overcome with the support of family members and the opportunity to learn and grow in a new setting.On the other hand, relocating to a different country can broaden children's horizons, expose them to diverse cultures, and help them develop valuable life skills such as adaptability and resilience. Living in a foreign country can also provide children with the opportunity to learn new languages, make friends from different backgrounds, and develop a more nuanced understanding of the world. Furthermore, children who experience international relocations tend to be more open-minded, curious, and empathetic towards others.In addition, many companies and organizations offer excellent support systems for expatriate families, including international schools, social clubs, and community groups. These resources can help children settle into their new environment and provide them with a sense of belonging and connection to their new community.In conclusion, while relocating to a different country can present some challenges for children, I firmly believe that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. With the right support and mindset, children can thrive in a new country, develop valuable life skills, and gain a unique perspective on the world. Ultimately, the experience of moving to a different country can be a valuable and enriching experience for children, one that can shape their futures and broaden their horizons.
1350;Nowadays many people choose ready-made food and refuse to cook at home, why and what are the advantages/disadvantages?;Nowadays many people choose ready-made food and refuse to cook at home. Why do you think it happens? What are the advantages and disadvantages of such a choice?It is a very popular practice in the modern society to order ready-made food from restaurants, rather than cooking at home. The main reasons for such a tendency may be cheap prices in some restaurants and people’s desire to save some time . Even though ordering food some obvious advantages, its disadvantages should not be underestimated.On the one hand, ordering prepared food may be the best choice for a busy person, who does not have time for cooking and cleaning. Cooking food at home requires a considerable amount of time, moreover the cleaning process may take even more time and resources than cooking itself. For example, cooking a simple dish such as chicken with rice home requires significant amounts of water and electricity for electrical appliances such as the oven and dishwasher. Hence, having an opportunity to order food from a restaurant will save a lot of time, electricity and water.On the other hand, delegating the process of cooking to some restaurant a dramatic disadvantage of not having the information about the ingredients used in the meals. With high demand, grow the volumes of required products, which sometimes can affect the quality of purchased produce. For example, it is a very common practice in some restaurants to make salads from products that are about to go bad and mask the rotten scent by adding some chemicals and spices. Hence, some restaurants may use poor quality products or chemicals for boosting taste and preservatives, which may have a negative effect on the customer’s health in the long run.In conclusion, ordering food from restaurants may be a tempting choice for people who have no time for cooking at home, but this approach has a critical disadvantage of being not informed about the ingredients used in the meal, which can have destructive consequences.This response covers the task requirements by giving a reason why people would choose to buy ready-made food and discussing the advantages and disadvantages of this trend. The ideas are conveyed quite clearly and supported by examples, paragraphing helps to present the information in a neat and easy to follow way, and the level of coherence is adequate in this essay. A range of complex sentence forms and advanced vocabulary is used and there are very few instances of erroneous grammar or inaccurate expressions (see corrections underlined in blue). Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.;The trend of opting for ready-made food over cooking at home has become increasingly prevalent in today's fast-paced world. One of the primary reasons behind this shift is the convenience and time-saving aspect of ready-made meals. With hectic lifestyles and tight schedules, many individuals find it challenging to dedicate time to cooking. Ready-made food, including takeouts, restaurant meals, and pre-packaged snacks, offers a quick and effortless solution to hunger, making it an attractive option for those with limited time.Another reason contributing to the preference for ready-made food is the diversity and variety it offers. Restaurants and food establishments provide a wide range of cuisines and dishes, allowing consumers to explore different flavors and culinary experiences without the need to cook themselves. This variety is especially appealing in urban areas where a multitude of dining options are available.However, there are significant disadvantages to relying heavily on ready-made food. One of the most notable concerns is the health impact. Ready-made meals are often high in calories, salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats, contributing to obesity, heart diseases, and other health issues when consumed excessively. Additionally, cooking at home allows for the use of fresh ingredients and control over nutritional content, which is not always possible with ready-made food.On the other hand, one of the advantages of ready-made food is the social aspect. Dining out or ordering in can be a social activity, whether it's a night out with friends, a family dinner, or a work lunch. It provides opportunities for social interaction and relaxation, away from the routine of cooking and cleaning up.In conclusion, while ready-made food offers convenience, variety, and social benefits, it also poses health risks and lacks the nutritional control and personal touch of home-cooked meals. A balanced approach, combining the convenience of ready-made food with regular home cooking, may offer the best of both worlds, allowing individuals to enjoy the benefits while minimizing the drawbacks.
1316;Nowadays many teenagers have a celebrity who they follow as a role model. Some people think this is not a good idea, because celebrities often set a bad example. Do you agree or disagree?;It is not uncommon for teenagers to worship celebrities. From singers to actors, many young people around the world look up to these stars and attempt to emulate their lifestyles. In my opinion, allowing children to idolize celebrities can often be detrimental, as they frequently set a poor example.Many of today’s celebrities tend to lack moral values, and they promote behaviour inappropriate for young people. For instance, some music videos feature explicit lyrics glorifying drug use and violence. In addition, the media often reports on celebrities who indulge in excessive partying or drinking alcohol despite being underage. These types of headlines can have a negative influence on impressionable teens who might falsely believe that they should follow suit to appear cool or successful.Poor morals aren’t the only issue, as many popular stars are also well-known for their irresponsible spending habits. They routinely splurge on luxury items such as designer clothing or expensive cars without any consideration for budgeting or saving money responsibly. This kind of behaviour is dangerous because it is normalizing materialism and teaching teens that costly possessions will bring them happiness instead of focusing on what really matters in life: meaningful relationships, knowledge, and hard work.To conclude, young adults should keep in mind that society’s perception of fame and fortune is based on temporary, insubstantial things rather than what actually matters. In the grand scheme of things, it would be far more beneficial for teenagers to spend time developing their own set of values rooted in quality education and strong family relationships.;The phenomenon of teenagers emulating celebrities as role models has become increasingly prevalent in contemporary society. While some individuals believe that having a celebrity role model is detrimental due to the often questionable behavior exhibited by these public figures, I tend to agree with this perspective.Celebrities, by the very nature of their profession, are frequently under scrutiny, and their actions are magnified for the world to see. Unfortunately, many of them engage in behaviors that are not conducive to setting a positive example for their young followers. For instance, some celebrities may promote unhealthy lifestyles, including substance abuse, reckless spending, or a lack of dedication to meaningful causes. By idolizing these figures, teenagers may inadvertently adopt similar habits, which can have long-lasting negative impacts on their personal development and well-being.Moreover, the constant exposure to celebrity culture through social media platforms can create unrealistic expectations and promote consumerism among teenagers. The curated and often misleading portrayal of celebrity lives can lead young minds to strive for unattainable beauty standards, material possessions, or fame, rather than focusing on more substantial goals such as education, personal growth, or community service.However, it is also worth noting that not all celebrities set a bad example. Some use their platform to raise awareness about important issues, support charitable causes, or demonstrate hard work and perseverance. These positive role models can indeed inspire teenagers to make a difference in their communities or pursue their passions with dedication and integrity.In conclusion, while I agree that the tendency of teenagers to follow celebrities as role models can be problematic due to the potential for negative influence, it is crucial to recognize that not all celebrities are bad role models. Parents, educators, and the celebrities themselves should encourage young fans to critically evaluate the actions and values of their idols, promoting a balanced and positive influence.
1359;Nowadays more and more people want to live by themselves, why is this happening?;Nowadays more and more people want to live by themselves. What are the reasons? Is it a positive or negative trend?These days a vast majority of people want to lead an independent life. The fundamental reason lies in people’s educational qualifications that fuel their craving for freedom in life. This can be seen as a positive trend because living alone is likely to nurture a mature mindset at early stages of one’s life.Many people are well educated to stand up on their own. Tertiary education broadens their horizons, and they wish to experience freedom of life. With a very good educational background it becomes easier to find a well-paid job, and with lucrative income they gain confidence to lead an independent life, thereby achieving their goals. For example, engineering graduates can find a job in another town and their salary is enough for them to move and settle down there. This enables them to move away from their family and live on their own.Living alone helps one to develop maturity, which can be seen as a positive impact on individuals and the society as a whole. Being independent means young people have to face life challenges alone and going through this process improves their resilience. They become more responsible, as they have to take care of themselves and develop budgeting skills and saving habits, for their future needs as well. Better planning of their finances nurtures the custom of wise spending at early stages of adult life.In conclusion, the reason why many people wish to live independently these days is because their education level gives them both the awareness of freedom in life and means of achieving it. Since living alone promotes one’s maturity, it seems to be a positive trend in today’s society.This response covers the task requirements by addressing the two parts of the question, why people choose to live alone and whether this is a positive trend. The ideas are clearly explained and supported, the information is organised in paragraphs in an easy to follow way, and the level of coherence is adequate. A range of complex sentence forms is used and there are no grammatical errors. Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.;In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of people opting to live alone. This trend is evident across various age groups and demographics, sparking curiosity about the underlying reasons. One primary factor contributing to this phenomenon is the desire for independence and autonomy. Living alone allows individuals to make their own decisions, set their own schedules, and enjoy uninterrupted personal space.Another reason for this shift is the changing nature of family dynamics and social relationships. With the rise of nuclear families and decreasing family sizes, many people are no longer living with extended family members. Furthermore, the increasing mobility and migration of people for education and career opportunities have led to physical distances between family members and friends, resulting in a greater number of people living alone.Additionally, economic factors play a significant role in this trend. As the economy grows and individual incomes rise, more people are financially capable of affording solo living arrangements. This, combined with the plethora of urban housing options available, makes living alone a viable and appealing choice for many.Lastly, the quest for self-discovery and personal growth is also a driving force behind the preference for solo living. Living alone provides individuals with the opportunity to focus on themselves, their interests, and their goals without the influence or distraction of others. It allows for a deeper understanding of oneself and can be a transformative experience that fosters resilience, responsibility, and a stronger sense of identity.In conclusion, the increasing preference for living alone is a multifaceted phenomenon influenced by factors such as independence, changing family and social structures, economic capability, and personal development. As societal norms and individual priorities continue to evolve, it is likely that this trend will persist, reflecting a broader shift towards valuing personal freedom and autonomy.

This phenomenon has become a dominant aspect of modern life, with individuals eagerly following popular things and adapting their routines accordingly. But what drives this behavior, and why are people spending more time on these activities?One primary reason is the influence of social media. Platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter have created a culture of sharing and comparing, where people feel pressure to stay on top of the latest trends and share their experiences with others. This has led to a fear of missing out (FOMO), causing individuals to spend more time scrolling through their feeds, seeking out the newest and most popular activities to participate in.Another factor contributing to this trend is the human desire for novelty and excitement. People are naturally drawn to new experiences and activities that provide a sense of thrill and adventure. With the constant stream of information available online, it's easier than ever to discover new hobbies, foods, and events that capture our attention and encourage us to try them out.Moreover, the rise of influencer culture has also played a significant role in shaping people's daily activities. Social media influencers often promote the latest trends and products, which can create a sense of urgency and exclusivity around certain activities. As a result, people feel compelled to follow suit and spend more time on these activities to feel connected to the influencer and their community.In conclusion, the reasons behind people spending more time on changing their daily activities to follow the latest trends are complex and multifaceted.

701;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. In this essay, the reason for wasting food and the acts which can be done by humans to reduce the amount of food one throws away will be thorougly discussed.Firstly, people waste food as one tends to be satisfied with the amount one eats. Thus, people order food more than one can eat as one can not estimate the amount of food. The amount of food one person can consume differs on one's conditions at that moment. The conditions include mood, physical features and activities one did on that particular day. Furthermore, one wants to taste all sorts of food, however, one can not eat all of those. Sometimes, people order food which are well decorated just to take a photo of it and upload it on social media such as Instagram. After taking photo, people just leave the food. The above mentioned reasons can be the causes of wastage of food.Apparently, people can reduce the amount of food they throw away. The restaurants can provide more informations about the amount and taste briefly to avoid the situation that consumers can not finish the food and are dissatisfied with the taste or smell. Moreover, consumers have to make a wise decision so that they do not waste both food and money. People should co-operate to reduce the wastage of food as it causes pollution on land. It leads to bad smell and brings insects to the areas.Conclusively, it is quite clear that people greatly waste food and there are a few ways for people to follow so as to reduce the amount of waste food.;"The issue of food waste has become a pressing concern in today's society. It is estimated that a significant amount of food is wasted by individuals and households, contributing to unnecessary waste and environmental degradation. In my opinion, people waste food due to several reasons. Firstly, the abundance of food options available in shops and restaurants leads to over purchasing, and consequently, excess food that is often discarded. Additionally, the lack of proper meal planning and inadequate storage facilities also contribute to food spoilage and waste.Another reason for food waste is the ""use by"" and ""best before"" dates on food products. Many people mistakenly believe that food is no longer edible after these dates, leading to unnecessary disposal of still edible food. Moreover, the rise of a ""throwaway"" culture, where food is often seen as a disposable commodity, has also contributed to the problem.To reduce the amount of food waste, several measures can be taken. Firstly, individuals can plan their meals and make shopping lists to avoid buying excess food. Restaurants and shops can also play a role by offering smaller portions and selling ""ugly"" or near-expired products at discounted prices. Furthermore, education and awareness campaigns can be launched to inform people about the importance of reducing food waste and the correct interpretation of ""use by"" and ""best before"" dates. Finally, food storage and preservation techniques can be improved to extend the shelf life of food products. By implementing these measures, we can significantly reduce the amount of food waste and contribute to a more sustainable food system. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of individuals, businesses, and governments to work together to address this issue and promote a culture of food conservation."
1354;Nowadays people waste a lot of food, why is this happening and how to reduce waste?;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?At the time when famines heavily strike impoverished third world countries, many people living in wealthy countries waste tremendous amounts of food daily. In my opinion, understanding the probable reasons of this phenomenon is important and may lead us to some applicable solutions that will result in reducing food waste.The low cost of food seems to be one of the obvious reasons, exacerbating the problem. Due to the revolutionary technological achievements, people have increased both the quality and the quantity of their crops. In turn, according to the laws of supply and demand, the prices of the crops have immensely dropped. A recent study of the FAO stated that the global crops prices have dropped 50 per cent over the last decade. This enabled people to buy excessive amounts of food without a real need.Furthermore, the absence of strict regulations to discourage or punish this attitude can also be considered a major cause. Not everyone is aware that wasting food may create problems. Consequently, they are likely to resist any calls for controlling the consumption of dietary supplies unless they are forced by the power of law. Several countries in the world saw a drop in their national food waste after implementing a ban on the excessive purchasing of food.Fortunately, there are some possible approaches that can be adopted by both people and governments. Firstly, raising the awareness of this issue is immensely important. Using social media platforms can draw public attention to the potential dangers of food waste and how communities can confront it. Secondly, enforcing laws that prohibit the wasting of food by people and companies will deter such harmful practice.In conclusion, the decreased price of food as well as lack of regulations allowed the unfortunate trend of throwing away food to continue. I believe that creating awareness and legislation are parts of a straightforward solution to this issue.The writer explored the reasons for throwing away food and suggested some solutions, effortlessly conveying his/her ideas in this well-written IELTS essay. The information is presented in an orderly, logical and coherent way. A wide range of vocabulary is used in this written response. The sentence structures are varied and the vocabulary is impressive. Overall, this essay could achieve IELTS Band 8.;"The issue of food waste has become a pressing concern in today's society. It is estimated that a significant portion of the food produced globally is wasted, which is not only economically unsustainable but also environmentally harmful. There are several reasons why people waste a lot of food. One of the main reasons is the lack of planning and poor management of food purchases. Many individuals tend to buy more food than they need, which often leads to spoilage and disposal. Additionally, the ""use-by"" and ""best-before"" dates on food products can be misleading, causing people to discard edible food prematurely.Another factor contributing to food waste is the cultural attitude towards food. In many societies, there is a tendency to over-cater for events and gatherings, resulting in a surplus of food that is often thrown away. Furthermore, the rise of convenience foods and ready-to-eat meals has led to a ""throwaway"" culture, where food is seen as a disposable commodity rather than a valuable resource.To reduce food waste, several strategies can be implemented. Firstly, individuals can plan their meals and make a grocery list to avoid buying excess food. Secondly, they can store food properly and use up leftovers creatively. Moreover, governments and businesses can play a crucial role in reducing food waste by implementing policies and practices that encourage the redistribution of surplus food to those in need. Raising awareness about the issue of food waste and promoting a culture of sustainability can also encourage people to adopt more mindful and responsible attitudes towards food consumption. By taking these steps, we can significantly reduce the amount of food that is wasted and work towards a more sustainable food system."
1351;Nowadays that many women have full time jobs, it is logical to share the housework evenly between men and women (agree/disagree);Nowadays in many countries women have full time jobs. Therefore, it is logical to share household tasks evenly between men and women. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Nowadays an ever-increasing number of women work full time, and in this reality it is widely believed that house chores should be shared between men and women equally. I strongly agree with this statement.One of the reasons for sharing housework between is to promote gender equality. A stereotype that has existed a long time is that females ought to stay home, taking care of the family once they got married. This includes looking after the children and doing all of the housework, which is fairly labour-intensive. However, this approach could have quite a few disadvantages. It would render women less able of keeping abreast of what is happening in the job market, thus forming a lifestyle where they might find it arduous to step into the society again. To avoid this, many women are willing to get back into the workforce soon after their maternity leave, and once they do, it makes sense that their husbands should share part of the household chores, to fulfill their family responsibilities.Nevertheless, we cannot be oblivious several drawbacks of this trend. One potential downside is that men are less experienced in dealing with household tasks. This is because many seldom take an active role in doing housework, according to customs of many countries. As a result, they may end up doing household tasks in a less than perfect way, which could contribute to some unnecessary quarrels between partners, hindering their family bond. However, the likelihood of this happening isn’t very high, because wives can offer some tips or guidance to their husbands when they learn how to share house chores such as mopping floors or doing laundry.To sum up, although some conflicts might be triggered when equally sharing the duties of household tasks, the benefits of this trend are relatively oblivious.The writer covered the task well by discussing the positives and negatives of sharing housework equally between men and women. Each paragraph has a clear purpose and assists with orderly presentation of ideas, making this essay easy to follow. The ideas are explained and substantiated, and the writer’s opinion is clear. The range of vocabulary is wide enough to avoid unnecessary repetition. Accuracy of expression could be improved (see corrections underlined in blue), but all in all this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;I strongly agree that in today's society, where many women have full-time jobs, it is logical to share the housework evenly between men and women. With the increasing number of women entering the workforce, the traditional division of labor within the household is no longer applicable. Women are no longer solely responsible for managing the household and caring for the family, as they are now equally contributing to the family income.Sharing housework evenly is not only a matter of fairness, but also a necessity. When both partners work full-time, they both need time to rest and pursue their own interests. If one partner is shouldering the bulk of the household responsibilities, it can lead to burnout and resentment. By sharing the workload, both partners can enjoy a better work-life balance and reduce stress.Moreover, sharing housework can also strengthen relationships and promote equality within the household. When men and women share responsibilities, they demonstrate mutual respect and appreciation for each other's contributions. This, in turn, can foster a more harmonious and supportive home environment.In conclusion, with the changing dynamics of modern society, it is logical and necessary to share housework evenly between men and women. This not only promotes fairness and equality but also allows both partners to maintain a healthy work-life balance and nurture a stronger, more supportive relationship. By embracing this mindset, we can work towards creating a more balanced and equitable society, where both men and women can thrive in their careers and personal lives. Ultimately, sharing housework is a step towards a more progressive and harmonious society.
25;Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?;"It is a serious problem that there is an inadequate number of students who tend to select science as their major subject in universities in many countries. In my view, students may think that studying science has not a good career path. Also, this issue may deeply affect the international state of a country.The main reason why people do not think to study science is that they may see science as something unpractical, and potentially, they are hard to find a job when they graduate. Students are generally afraid that there is no employment opportunity after they graduate from university. Unlike engineering and business management, in which fields employers provide plenty of vocational positions for graduated students because there are lots of companies activating in these fields and universities may provide some practical training courses and internships. Students studying science have a relatively narrow way to walk, and may just be scientists. Moreover, although a successful scientist can get a massive bonus from some prizes, it is too hard to accomplish and is more likely to fail. Therefore, Students will avoid taking those risks and choose other subjects that are relatively stable and easy to find a job.This trend will eventually decrease the state of a country. Developing science can provide a strong and firm foundation for a country to establish a healthy and prosperous community. If there are not enough scientists, the whole scientific ability will decrease. Not only will the government pay extra money to other foreign countries to buy the required technology such as military equipment, but the public needs to spend more time and pay more effort to maintain the international standard production rate of a country. It is extremely dangerous that a nation easily suffers from a financial crisis and, finally, it influences the living standard of its citizens and causes damage to its financial systems.In summary, while science is regarded as a ""useless"" subject because of its narrow career path and low success rate, it is vital that the economic systems would be affected if a country develop without scientists.";The dwindling number of students opting for science subjects in universities has become a pressing concern in many countries. One of the primary reasons for this trend is the perceived difficulty and competitiveness of science courses. Many students are deterred by the rigorous academic demands and the high level of mathematical proficiency required to excel in these fields. Additionally, the lack of hands-on experience and insufficient resources in schools can make science subjects seem unappealing and abstract, leading to a lack of interest among students.Another significant factor contributing to this issue is the limited career guidance and counseling provided to students. Many young people are unaware of the diverse range of career opportunities available in science fields, such as biotechnology, environmental science, and data analysis. As a result, they may opt for more traditional and seemingly stable career paths, such as business or law. The effects of this trend on society are far-reaching and alarming. A shortage of skilled scientists and researchers can hinder technological advancements, medical breakthroughs, and innovative solutions to pressing environmental issues.The consequences of this problem can be seen in the decline of research and development in various fields, leading to a brain drain and a loss of competitiveness in the global market. Furthermore, a lack of science-literate citizens can lead to poor decision-making and a lack of critical thinking in everyday life. To address this issue, governments, educational institutions, and industry leaders must work together to promote science education, provide career guidance, and offer hands-on learning experiences that make science subjects more engaging and accessible. By doing so, we can inspire and equip the next generation of scientists and thinkers to drive progress and innovation in their respective fields. Ultimately, it is essential to recognize the importance of science education and take collective action to reverse this trend and foster a more scientifically literate and innovative society.
1361;Obesity is becoming common among children, give reasons and solutions (from Target Band ;"This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskObesity was once considered a disease of adults; however, it is becoming increasingly common among children. Why do you think this is happening? What can be done to help children stay healthy?Write at least 250 wordsFor many years obesity was perceived as a condition occurring only in adult life. However, in recent years the number of children suffering from obesity has grown significantly. There are several causes and numerous solutions which can be used to tackle this worrying phenomenon, and this essay will present a couple of them.While some reasons for childhood obesity are genetic, others include poor food choices exacerbated by easy availability of fast food, insufficient physical activity and a history of family members being overweight. Unlike the former, the latter factors can be changed, if the adults in the child’s life gain awareness and are willing to take action.To begin with, health is a complex matter which requires a balanced approach. In other words, there isn’t a single solution to maintain health, on the contrary, it is rather a mixture of multiple factors, such as and regular physical activity. For this reason, increasing the awareness of healthy habits among children is a responsibility of utmost importance. What is more, it can be easily achieved through the education system.On the other hand, children’s education might to stop the situation from worsening. Along with well designed health education schemes, we should also try to stop food companies from overusing sugar in products the young ones. It has been proven that more than 70% of the products available in an average supermarket contain dangerously high levels of white sugar. Sugar rich diet not only causes a significant weight gain, but also contributes to diseases, such as diabetes in young population.To summarize, emphasis put on the awareness of healthy living among children is invaluable. Furthermore, combining healthy habits with stopping food companies from in products which are easily children can be effectively implemented by the governments. Positive outcomes of such measures taken today will definitely have a long lasting effect on the future generations.This is a well developed response to the question. Relevant key points are included in the answer. Appropriate examples are also used to corroborate the writer’s point of view. Paragraphing is skillfully managed, information and ideas are logically sequenced. A wide range of vocabulary is used to allow certain flexibility and precision. Also, a variety of sentence structures is used. Accuracy of expression needs some attention (see corrections underlined in blue). Overall, the essay could achieve Band 8 in IELTS.";The prevalence of obesity among children has become a pressing concern globally. This alarming trend can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the sedentary lifestyle of children, spent mostly indoors playing video games or watching television, has significantly reduced their physical activity levels. Furthermore, the easy availability and affordability of junk food and sugary drinks have made them a staple in many children's diets, leading to an excessive intake of calories and unhealthy nutrients.Another contributing factor is the lack of education and awareness among parents and caregivers about the importance of a balanced diet and regular exercise for children. Many parents, due to their busy schedules, often rely on convenience foods that are high in fat, salt, and sugar, without realizing the long-term health implications for their children.To combat this growing issue, several solutions can be implemented. Firstly, incorporating physical education and activity into school curriculums can help increase children's energy expenditure and encourage healthy lifestyles. Additionally, schools can play a pivotal role by providing nutritionally balanced meal options in their cafeterias, limiting the availability of unhealthy snacks, and promoting water as the primary beverage.Parents and caregivers also have a significant role to play. They can encourage outdoor play, limit screen time, and prepare healthy meals at home. Moreover, community-based initiatives such as kids' sports leagues, can provide opportunities for children to engage in physical activities while promoting social interaction and fun.Ultimately, tackling childhood obesity requires a multi-faceted approach that involves schools, parents, and the community. By promoting physical activity,,assistantand healthy eating habits from a young age, we can help prevent the onset of obesity and its related health issues, ensuring a healthier future for the next generation. It is imperative that we act now to educate, support, and facilitate environments that encourage children to adopt and maintain healthy lifestyles. By doing so, we can significantly reduce the incidence of obesity among children and foster a society that values and practices wellness.

People, especially the younger generation, are increasingly opting for sugary drinks over healthier alternatives. One of the primary reasons for this trend is the widespread availability and aggressive marketing of these drinks. Sugary drinks are easily accessible and heavily advertised, making them a convenient and appealing choice for many.Another reason is the lack of awareness about the harmful effects of excessive sugar consumption. Many people are unaware of the link between sugary drinks and various health problems, such as obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay. Furthermore, the busy lifestyle of modern people often leads to a reliance on quick and easy drinks, rather than taking the time to prepare a healthy beverage.To combat this issue, several solutions can be implemented. Firstly, education and awareness campaigns can be launched to inform people about the risks associated with sugary drinks. Schools and workplaces can also play a crucial role by promoting healthy drinking habits and providing access to clean water and unsweetened beverages. Additionally, governments can introduce taxes on sugary drinks, making them less appealing to consumers.Individuals can also make a difference by making conscious choices about their drink preferences. Opting for water, unsweetened tea, or coffee can significantly reduce sugar intake. Moreover, people can support companies that offer healthier drink options and encourage others to do the same. By working together, we can reduce the consumption of sugar-based drinks and promote a healthier lifestyle for everyone. Ultimately, it is essential to address this issue to prevent the long-term health consequences and promote a healthier and more sustainable future.
1418;People attend college or university for many different reasons (for example, new experiences, career preparation, or to increase knowledge).;Why do you think people attend college or university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Many people after their high school years for several reason which they choose . I believe that the most common reason why people to have new experiences on life , to prepare for a career, and to increase their knowledge of their personality.Firstly, many people to have new experience in life. Many students leave their home and move to live when they go to university. This is the first time that they had to make a resolution on their own, without their parents’ help. Making their own decisions will increase their knowledge of themselves. Moreover, students university can meet different students from different nationalities and religions so students can learn about different around the world.Secondly, many people go to university or collage to prepare for a career.

All of these prepare them for their career.Also, students attend university or college to increase their self-knowledge of their personality life. They attend increase their knowledge in subjects which they find interesting. For example, many students study science because they are in science but they work .To sum up, I think people should not only focus on a career when they go to university or college. They have to follow to have new experience and knowledge about their personality and the great world around them which they live in.;Attending college or university is a significant milestone in an individual's life, and people enroll for a variety of reasons.

College life offers a unique opportunity to step out of one's comfort zone, meet new people, and engage in diverse activities. Students can join clubs, sports teams, or volunteer for causes they are passionate about, allowing them to develop new skills, build relationships, and create lifelong memories.Others attend college or university for career preparation. In today's competitive job market, a degree is often a prerequisite for many professions.

1253;People living in large cities have to face many problems in everyday life. What are those problems?Should the government encourage people to move to regional towns?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is not surprise to see that major cities are struggling with various issues which may associate with goverment and public issues as well.These issues are mild in some cities where as severe and vulnerable in few cities.Some of the common problems are increased crime rate,reduced safety,air pollution,noise pollution,flood,mechanical life and reduced greenery.The main cause for the above issues are increased population,uncontrolled carbon emission,poorly planned road and other public facilities such as underground drainage,contaminated water,roads and electricity.In general if the government take steps to control the above mentioned issues by implenting good law and orders which can improve public safety and happiness.Assist the sanitary boards with proper funding which may help to reduce water stagnant during rainy season.Funding for new research and developments may enhance to clear air and water pollution which can bring good health to the local residents.In contrast government may consider to develop the nearest towns with basic facilities such as modern housing,educational advancements,good roads,water and sanitary facilities. These facilities enhance the people to move to smaller town which may enhance to manage the key issues which are currently facing in the major cities.For instance Delhi,Capital of India seriously struggling with severe air pollution and lack of security which is heavily populated.Researches says that these problems can be reduced if the population rate is reduced.Meantime some group of people suggests that if the government may adopt new technology or structure which are following by any successful cities in the world.I personally feels that this also could be a better solution if it can be adopted by the government.By arguing the possitive and negative impacts it is difficult to conclude which option may works better to sove the issues.;Living in large cities can be a daunting experience, fraught with numerous problems that affect everyday life. One of the primary concerns is the high cost of living, including exorbitant housing costs, as well as inflated prices for food, transportation, and other necessities. Additionally, traffic congestion and pollution are prevalent issues, as the sheer volume of people and vehicles can lead to gridlocked roads and a decline in air quality.Another significant problem is the strain on public services, such as healthcare and education, which can become overwhelmed by the large population. This can result in lengthy wait times for medical treatment and oversized classes that hinder the learning experience. Furthermore, the fast-paced and competitive environment of large cities can lead to increased stress levels, as individuals strive to keep up with the demands of city life.In light of these challenges, the question arises as to whether the government should encourage people to move to regional towns. In my opinion, yes, they should. By incentivizing people to relocate to regional areas, the government can help alleviate the pressure on large cities and promote a better quality of life. For instance, regional towns often boast more affordable housing, less congestion, and a cleaner environment. Moreover, public services in these areas are less strained, allowing for more personalized attention and care. Examples of successful regional towns can be seen in countries like Australia, where the government has implemented initiatives to attract people to smaller towns, resulting in thriving communities and a more balanced population distribution. By adopting similar strategies, governments can create a more sustainable and enjoyable living experience for their citizens.

Unfortunately, individuals often fail to create one. This essay will discuss what is an ideal society, as well as ways on how to make it happen.An ideal community is a place where peace of mind over shadows fear. We all now that everyone wants a place that is criminal free. For example, people can just walk in an aisle without thinking of being raped or kidnapped. Moreover, it is a community in which discrimination, prejudice and racism is prohibited. In short, everyone is treated equally regardless of gender, colors, religions, social status, jobs and looks. It also means that, people can just walk in and out of a hospital or establishments without being looked down or degraded by other people especially those with high status.However, it is difficult for people to meet this kind of standards. This mainly because nobody is made perfect and as a human being we are mostly dominated by hatred, jealousy and selfishness. Although people fail to have a perfect society, there are some ways on how to have a near perfect place to live. First of all, government should make the lives of the people a better one by being an active role model to the citizens. There should not be corruption involve amongst the higher ups. Also, as what the saying goes ""learning should start at home"", it means that, parents should the take the initiative to educate their children proper manners in dealing with other people. In Japan, children were taught in a very young age on how to treat other people. That is why they always bow down their head as a sign of respect.To conclude, creating an essential environment can be challenging and demanding for all of us. Eventhough, it is impossible to make, each one of us can has the capacity to contribute to make society an almost perfect one.";The concept of an ideal society has long been a topic of discussion among philosophers, policymakers, and individuals alike. In my opinion, creating an ideal society is a challenging but not impossible task. An ideal society, to me, is one where all members have access to basic necessities like healthcare, education, and economic opportunities, while living in harmony with the environment and each other.One major obstacle to creating an ideal society is the diversity of human needs and values. What one person considers ideal may not be the same for another. However, I believe that certain fundamental principles can guide us towards achieving this goal. Firstly, education plays a critical role in shaping individuals who are informed, empathetic, and actively engaged in their communities. By ensuring that everyone has access to quality education, we can foster a population that is more likely to make informed decisions and contribute positively to society.Secondly, economic equality is essential. Societies with large gaps between the rich and the poor are more likely to experience social unrest and decreased opportunities for the less fortunate. Implementing policies that promote fair distribution of wealth, such as progressive taxation and social welfare programs, can help mitigate these issues. For example, countries like Norway and Denmark have implemented robust social safety nets and enjoy high levels of social cohesion and happiness among their citizens.Lastly, environmental sustainability is crucial for the long-term viability of any society. This involves adopting practices that reduce our carbon footprint, conserve natural resources, and protect biodiversity. Governments and individuals must work together to implement and support eco-friendly policies and lifestyles. In conclusion, creating an ideal society requires a multi-faceted approach that prioritizes education, economic equality, and environmental sustainability. While the journey is long and complex, with collective effort and a commitment to these principles, we can move closer to our vision of an ideal society.
1326;People should follow the local customs and traditions, when they come to live in a new country. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The globalised world these days makes it simpler than ever before for people to relocate and start building a life in a new country. As everyone comes from their own cultural background, a question arises of whether or not people should be expected to follow the customs of their host country. I completely agree with the view that while learning about the local customs may require some time and effort, it is valuable and will aid the integration of the newcomers into society.In many cultures following the local customs means showing respect, which is an important moral value in nearly every culture. The opposite is also true: disregarding traditions is often seen as a sign of disrespect. In order to establish good neighbourly relationships and feel welcome in the new place, it is important to demonstrate the effort to become part of the community. By expressing an interest in learning traditions, new arrivals gain a chance to interact with their neighbours and colleagues, get to know them and build some connections in the new country.Another positive aspect is the enhanced feeling of belonging that people get from participating in activities others around them are doing. When a national festival is in full swing, standing on the sidelines might make people feel excluded and perhaps even homesick, whereas joining others opens up opportunities to attend special events together, go to parties, meet new people and feel part of the celebrations. In Australia, for example, Easter is a very special time of the year and some of the traditional activities include Easter egg decoration and gifting, and baking hot cross buns; sharing your designs and recipes with others is an excellent conversation starter.In conclusion, learning the customs and traditions of one’s new country doesn’t mean a loss of their own culture. On the contrary, it is an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of cultural connections and should be embraced as a positive experience.";When individuals relocate to a new country, the question of whether they should adhere to local customs and traditions arises. In my opinion, I largely agree that people should follow the local customs and traditions when they come to live in a new country. This is because respecting and embracing the local culture is essential for a harmonious and successful integration into the community.By adopting local customs and traditions, individuals demonstrate their willingness to adapt and respect the host country's way of life. This helps to foster positive relationships with the locals, avoid unintentionally causing offense, and facilitate a smoother transition into the new environment. For instance, in some countries, removing one's shoes before entering a home is a sign of respect, and failure to do so may be perceived as rude. By following such customs, individuals can avoid misunderstandings and build stronger bonds with their new community.Moreover, following local customs and traditions can also enrich one's own cultural experience and broaden their perspective. Immersing oneself in a new culture can be a rewarding and educational experience, allowing individuals to gain a deeper understanding of the local history, values, and beliefs. However, it is also important to note that individuals should not be expected to abandon their own cultural heritage entirely. Rather, they should strive to find a balance between respecting the local customs and traditions, while also maintaining their own unique cultural identity.In conclusion, I believe that people should make an effort to follow the local customs and traditions when they come to live in a new country. Not only does this facilitate a successful integration into the community, but it also allows individuals to grow and develop as global citizens, with a deeper appreciation and respect for the diversity of cultures that exist around the world.
1370;People should not work beyond the retirement age (agree/disagree);Some believe that people should not continue to work once they reach the age of retirement. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your experience.In recent years, with the improvement in healthcare sector and better , people are able to live longer and contribute to the economic progress of a nation more, compared to the past. Some see this as an entirely positive development, while others point out the drawbacks of working beyond the retirement age.Delaying retirement enables individuals to actively contribute to the society. On a personal level, working past retirement age provides an avenue for individuals to remain not only physically but also mentally active. Moreover, this option empowers the ageing population to be financially independent and economically self-sustainable past retirement age. In countries with growing ageing population such as Singapore, for instance, citizens are given an option to work beyond their retirement age based on the demands of their job and their capability to handle these tasks. Hence, working beyond retirement age empowers workers, ensures economic progression of the nation, and alleviates the challenges faced by an ageing population.On the flip side, working beyond the retirement age may result in adverse health impacts on workers and a decrease in productivity levels. In Japan, the suicide rates have recently been increasing due to rising stress levels at work faced by the ageing population who are pushed to work beyond their optimal capacity. Escalating stress levels from work to various health complications putting a strain on the healthcare system. Hence, working beyond retirement age may worsen the overall welfare of individuals and adversely impact the economy.To sum up, though working beyond retirement age health hazards leading to reduction in productivity levels, it seems to me that the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion, by assessing the capability of individuals and tailoring their jobs to their health profile, firms and companies should actively involve their workers to be productive beyond their retirement age.This essay is an excellent example of IELTS Band 8 writing. The author presents sound arguments making his/her point of view very clear, examples are being used to support the writer’s points and the organisation of information is handled very well. There are some minor inaccuracies, however, they wouldn’t affect the score much in the real test. Well done!;I disagree with the statement that people should not work beyond the retirement age. While retirement is often viewed as a well-deserved break after decades of hard work, many individuals choose to continue working beyond the traditional retirement age for various reasons. Firstly, working beyond retirement age can be beneficial for one's physical and mental health. Studies have shown that staying engaged in work can help keep the mind active and reduce the risk of age-related cognitive decline. Moreover, it provides an opportunity for social interaction, which is essential for emotional well-being. Many people find that their work provides them with a sense of purpose, which can be difficult to replicate in retirement.Secondly, working beyond retirement can be financially advantageous. With the rising cost of living and increasing life expectancy, many people may not have sufficient savings to support themselves throughout their retirement. Continuing to work can provide a much-needed income supplement, allowing individuals to maintain their standard of living and pursue their interests without financial stress.Lastly, working beyond retirement can also be beneficial for the economy and society as a whole. Experienced workers can share their knowledge and skills with younger colleagues, ensuring that valuable expertise is not lost. Additionally, many retirees choose to work in fields that contribute to the greater good, such as education, healthcare, or non-profit sectors, which can have a positive impact on the community.In conclusion, people should have the freedom to choose whether or not to work beyond the retirement age. With its potential benefits for physical and mental health, financial stability, and societal contribution, continuing to work beyond retirement can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience for many individuals. Ultimately, the decision to work beyond retirement should be based on personal choice and capability, rather than being dictated by a fixed age limit.
709;People think that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. Others believe that there are other alternative solutions for reducing crime.Discuss both views and give your opinion on this topic.;"Nowadays the sentences that judges give to criminals is always at the centre of attention of the society; some people think that the best way to reduce the amount of crime cases is to give longer prison sentences, while, others say that there are other alternative ways to stop it. This essay will talk about both views and, at the end, I will give my opinion about the argument.It is always more common to see long sentences for criminals, also if their crimes are not too bad to deserve that type of punishment; the reason why the court gives to them long sentences is because they think that staying a lot in prison will make the criminals understand that what they did is wrong and, next time, they will think twice before doing something bad or against the law.However long sentences can go against the human rights because they will take away from prisoners years of their life; for this reason, some people think that it can be better if, instead of stay close in a jail without doing nothing, they can be used in various works that will make them useful for the society and better person at the end of the sentence, like cleaning the city, helping old people in retirement homes and also cook for poor people.I think that there are other ways to stop crime instead of giving long punishments, also because everyone should have a second chance in their life and, more importantly, teach and show to prisoners different aspects of the community will help cities to become better places with less crimes to stop.This essay talked about two different types of views about crime sentences in our society, with my own opinion about the argument in the last part of it.";The issue of reducing crime is a complex and multifaceted one, with various solutions being proposed. On one hand, some people argue that the best way to reduce crime is to impose longer prison sentences, as a means of deterrence and punishment. This approach is based on the idea that harsher penalties will discourage potential offenders from committing crimes, as they will be fearful of the consequences. Furthermore, proponents of this view argue that longer prison sentences will also provide a sense of justice and retribution for the victims of crime.On the other hand, others believe that there are alternative solutions that can be more effective in reducing crime. These alternatives may include rehabilitation programs, community service, and addressing the root causes of crime such as poverty, unemployment, and social inequality. According to this view, the focus should be on preventing crime from occurring in the first place, rather than simply punishing offenders after the fact. This approach recognizes that crime is often a symptom of deeper societal issues, and that addressing these underlying problems can be a more effective way to reduce crime in the long run.In my opinion, while longer prison sentences may provide a sense of justice and deterrence, I believe that alternative solutions are more likely to be effective in reducing crime. By addressing the root causes of crime and providing support and rehabilitation to offenders, we can create a safer and more just society. Moreover, this approach is not only more humane but also more cost-effective in the long run, as it can help to reduce recidivism rates and prevent new crimes from being committed. Therefore, I think that alternative solutions should be prioritized in the effort to reduce crime.
1286;People today find their lives more and more dominated by their jobs. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is certainly true that many people around the world find their lives dominated by the work that they have to do. This is shown when you realise how people’s work, and how much time, effort and resources they devote to it, is often the subject of conversation.Most people depend on their jobs to generate an income to pay for their lives’ necessities and luxuries, and so work can naturally become a dominating focus. As this is an important part of nearly everyone’s everyday life, it can seem that people’s lives are indeed becoming more influenced by their jobs. Whether this emphasis on work is more significant now than in previous years is debatable. In many developed countries around the world, there are procedures in place to help people with finding work, providing unemployment benefits, ensuring education, and offering pension payments. In times past, these provisions were not in place and a job or business was required to provide the necessary income.Therefore, in spite of increases in the cost of living in many places around the world, it can be argued there is actually less pressure than in previous years to keep one’s job and perform well at it. This, in turn, would lead to people’s lives being less influenced by their jobs today. It is also true that in the past, people were as responsible and focused on doing well in their responsibilities as today and so, in this respect, the people of the past would be equally dedicated to their work as people are today.While I agree that people’s lives today are often dominated by their jobs, I feel that the current situation is not necessarily worse than before. In fact, it may be more positive, due to the fewer pressures to earn money in many countries.;"The notion that people's lives are increasingly dominated by their jobs is a pervasive concern in modern society. I agree with this statement to a significant extent, as many individuals find themselves spending a substantial amount of time and energy on their professional pursuits, often at the expense of their personal lives.One primary reason for this phenomenon is the rising demands of the modern workplace. With the advancement of technology, employees are often expected to be constantly connected and available, blurring the lines between work and personal life. For instance, many professionals are required to check work emails and respond to messages outside of working hours, effectively extending their workday into their personal time. This can lead to an encroachment on personal time, as individuals feel pressured to be perpetually ""on the clock.""Another factor contributing to the dominance of work in people's lives is the increasing pressure to maintain a certain standard of living. As the cost of living continues to rise, many individuals feel compelled to work longer hours or take on additional jobs to make ends meet. This can result in a situation where work becomes the primary focus of one's life, with personal relationships, hobbies, and interests taking a backseat. For example, a friend of mine works multiple jobs to support her family, leaving her little time for leisure activities or socializing.However, it is worth noting that some individuals are able to maintain a healthy work-life balance, where their job does not dominate their life. These individuals often prioritize self-care, set clear boundaries between work and personal life, and make time for activities and relationships that bring them joy and fulfillment. Ultimately, while many people do find their lives dominated by their jobs, it is possible to resist this trend and cultivate a more balanced and fulfilling existence."
1264;Percentage of UK people who consumed daily recommended amount of fruit and vegetable in 2002, 2006 and 2010.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar graph compares the proportion of UK citizens in terms of their consumption of daily recommended portions of fruits and vegetables in three different years which are 2002, 2006, and 2010.Overall, females consumed the highest percentage of their recommended healthy food, followed by males, and last are the children.additionally the year 2006 had witnessed the vastest consumption of vegetables and fruits among all given years.Women ate exactly 25% of the daily adviced dose of natural food in the year 2002, 32% in 2006, and 26% in 2010, however men took 22% of the recommended dose in the year 2002, 26% in 2006, and 24% in 2010.On the other hand younger individuals only consumed 11%, 18%, and 16% of the daily requirements of veggies and fruits in the years 2002, 2006, and 2010 respectively. It appears that residents of the UK had eaten the highest daily requirements of greens and fruits in the year 2006 as compared to the years 2006 and 2010.;According to the data available, the percentage of UK people who consumed the daily recommended amount of fruit and vegetables in 2002, 2006, and 2010 is a topic of interest. In 2002, approximately 22% of males and 28% of females met the recommended daily intake. Four years later, in 2006, the numbers slightly decreased to 20% for males and 25% for females. By 2010, the percentages further declined to 18% for males and 22% for females.The main feature of this data is the consistent decline in the percentage of people consuming the recommended daily amount of fruit and vegetables over the eight-year period. This downward trend is observed in both males and females, indicating a concerning decrease in healthy eating habits among the UK population.Comparing the data across the years, it is evident that the decline is more pronounced in males, with a 4% decrease from 2002 to 2010, whereas females experienced a 6% decrease over the same period. However, it is worth noting that females consistently had a higher percentage of meeting the daily recommended intake compared to males across all three years.The decline in fruit and vegetable consumption among the UK population is a public health concern, as a diet rich in these foods is essential for maintaining good health and preventing chronic diseases. The data highlights the need for targeted interventions and campaigns to promote healthy eating habits and increase the consumption of fruit and vegetables among the UK population, particularly among males. Overall, the data suggests that more efforts are required to encourage and support the UK population in meeting the daily recommended intake of fruit and vegetables.
1402;Popular events like the football world cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The World Cup football and the Olympics are held worldwide with great national support and expectations. As a fan of those competitions, I agree with the idea that sporting events can be necessary for international relations and national unity, but only partially, because such events can have unintended effects on relationships between countries.First of all, the World Cup, Olympics and other international games work for easing tensions among different nations. For example, South and North Korea have football games regularly two nations a chance to understand each other . In the mid of North Korean supporters came to South Korea with the footballers and they were very excited during the sporting events. Even if it sounds ridiculous, many South Koreans were quite surprised at that moment when North Koreans shouted and cried during the match. We all realized that they were very normal sports fans even though they were occasionally very secretive. Through the sports, two divided nations could reduce their political and ideological tensions and could feel the patriotic unity.On the other hand, some sports matches can make international relations worse. For instance, football or baseball games between Korea and Japan are always big matches in two countries where . Sometimes, after the matches, the two rivals blame each other and their patriotic emotions explode in an aggressive way. scenario is that the troubles caused by losing games affect the players directly.;The statement that popular events like the football world cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way is a topic of debate. While I agree that these events can have a positive impact on international relations, I also believe that their role is often exaggerated.On the one hand, these events can indeed bring people together and provide a platform for countries to engage in friendly competition, which can help ease tensions and foster diplomacy. For instance, the Olympic Games have a long history of promoting unity and peaceful coexistence among nations. Moreover, the excitement and passion generated by international sporting events can provide a safe outlet for patriotic emotions, allowing fans to express their national pride without resorting to violence or hostility.On the other hand, it is essential to recognize that the impact of these events on international tensions is often short-lived and superficial. In reality, the underlying conflicts and political differences between nations are not addressed by these events. Furthermore, the intense rivalry and nationalism that can emerge during these competitions can sometimes escalate tensions and reinforce existing divisions. For example, the fierce rivalry between certain national football teams has led to violent clashes between fans,But, the overall benefits of international sporting events in promoting global unity and providing a platform for countries to come together in a spirit of friendship and fair play should not be underestimated. In conclusion, I agree to some extent that international sporting events can ease international tensions and provide a safe outlet for patriotic emotions, but their role should not be overstated, and their limitations should be acknowledged.
913;Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:In the past, sporting champions used to be motivated primarily by the desire to win a match or to break world records. These days they are more likely to be motivated by prize money and the opportunity to be famous.What message does this send to young people and how does this attitude to sport affect the sports themselves?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;There were many sport competitions organized after the World-War II since the first Olympic games was held in Athena, in 1963, to bring the world together again. Previously, sport competition was seen as an opportunity for the athletes to break the world records for the pride of their home countries. However, nowadays, people are more inclined to win the match because of money reward and glory. I believe that young people should be more encouraged to achieve their goals to become a champion so that the value of sport competition would not be purely for commercial purpose.In the last decades, there have been a lot of sport competitions being held from national to global level. The athletes were trained by the supported teams to do their best to become the world champion. It was the pride of such athlete to win and see their national flags were rised after the match. Over the years, sport has become more commercial following its popularity to attract global audiences. Many athletes are paying more attention for the opportunity to win the match for commercial purpose. For example, one wants to become a famous soccer player so that they could become the ambassador of Adidas and get more income out of it.Due to the temptation for getting famous and having more money, there are people who choose to play unfairly during a competition. Instead of focusing on increasing their skills, they would cheat to win the game for money. For example, a soccer player may use thyroid injection for boosting their energy level even though it is strictly prohibited. Moreover, sport is not seen anymore to promote peace and solidarity among people from different cultural backgrounds but for the chance to get the superficial gloriness.To conclude, even if the motivation has shifted, the young people should learn to focus more on becoming a real champion and play fairly so that they can become the best athletes in thier expertise while the money and glory would follow them after.;The world of sports has undergone a significant transformation over the years. In the past, sporting champions were driven by a genuine passion for their sport and a desire to win, as well as to break world records. However, today's champions are often motivated by the lure of prize money and the allure of fame. This shift in motivation sends a concerning message to young people and has a profound impact on the sports themselves.The emphasis on prize money and fame can lead young people to prioritize financial gain and celebrity status over the true values of sportsmanship, such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. This can result in a generation of athletes who are more focused on personal gain than on the joy of competition and the pursuit of excellence. For instance, the recent trend of young footballers prioritizing lucrative sponsorship deals over developing their skills on the pitch is a testament to this phenomenon.Moreover, the prioritization of prize money and fame can also have a corrosive effect on the sports themselves. The increasing commercialization of sports can lead to a homogenization of styles and a focus on entertainment value over athletic merit. The proliferation of scripted reality TV shows and sensationalized media coverage can further exacerbate this trend, creating a culture that values drama and controversy over genuine sporting achievement. The recent scandal surrounding the buying and selling of votes for the FIFA Ballon d'Or award is a stark reminder of the dangers of allowing financial interests to dominate the world of sports.In conclusion, the shift in motivation from a desire to win and break records to a desire for prize money and fame sends a worrying message to young people and has a profound impact on the sports themselves. It is essential that we reclaim the true values of sportsmanship and promote a culture that prioritizes athleticism, teamwork, and fair play over financial gain and celebrity status.
903;Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:Some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by giving them extra money. This practice can act as an incentive for some but may also have a negative impact on others.To what extent is this style of management effective?Are there better ways of encouraging employees to work hard?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Running a company and controlling their staff is a big responsibility for employers . In general, employers should have a great vision about the future of their own company and how to improve it in a better way .To start with, some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by simply giving them more many. In addition, that practice can act as a good source of motivation, you can see that your hard work and your extra hours wasn't waste after all .On the other hand, this style of management may affect tha company and their community in a negative way . For example, the manager of the institution may be more focused on just one employee who's always have the extra credit for the work therefore the other employees work hard for nothing and that leave a bad idea that they clearly work for just having that extra money and rewards from the manager .Beside that, employees will be affected and their productivity will change and drop even more and all of that is a result on how the management of a company impact their work and their effort of doing more .To sum it up, all the members in that company worked so hard, a little credit for their effort and long hours of developing their company and rewards them for it won't do any harm . Not to mention, a manager can reward the staff of the institution by giving them a day or two off or basically a three hours break . Anything that make them really satisfied after their long and efficient work towards the developing of the company.;The practice of rewarding exceptional employees with extra money has been a long-standing management strategy to boost productivity and motivation. On the one hand, the financial incentives can act as a powerful motivator for some individuals, as it provides a tangible recognition of their hard work and dedication. For instance, a sales team that meets or exceeds its quarterly targets may receive a bonus, encouraging them to strive for similar achievements in the future. This approach can be effective in driving short-term results and fostering a competitive work environment.However, on the other hand, this style of management can have a negative impact on others, potentially creating resentment and demotivation among those who do not receive the rewards. If the criteria for receiving the extra money are not transparent or fair, it may lead to a sense of inequality and dissatisfaction. Furthermore, overemphasizing financial rewards can lead to an overly competitive and individualistic work culture, which may undermine teamwork and collaboration.A more effective approach to encouraging employees to work hard might involve a combination of financial and non-financial incentives, such as opportunities for growth and development, public recognition, and a positive work-life balance. For example, companies like Google offer their employees perks such as flexible working hours, on-site childcare, and opportunities for professional development, which can foster a sense of belonging, motivation, and job satisfaction. By adopting a more holistic approach to employee motivation, employers can create a more positive and productive work environment, where employees feel valued and supported, not just financially rewarded. Ultimately, a balanced and equitable management strategy is crucial to ensuring that all employees feel motivated and encouraged to contribute to the company's success.
897;Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime.Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In the UK and Australia, a jury is not provided with the defendant's previous criminal history. Some law representatives claim that this should be reverted, and the jury must be provided with this information beforehand. I fully agree with this statement since the jury will have a better understanding of the defendant's behaviour, and the final decision will be easier to understand for the audience.Having the jury the right access to the defendant's past criminal background, would provide the jury with enough information about the defendant's behaviour. This is because there are certain previous criminal behavioural patterns which allow a better profesional decision-making from the part of the jury. For example, a recent study of the Law's Practice of Melboune, has shown that around 77% of people who commit a crime, were involved in at least one criminal event in the past with similar characteristics to the current crime.On the other hand, if the jury has access to the defendant's past criminal history, it would be easier for the audience to understand the nature of the jury's final decision. This is because there have been cases in which the jury's final decision was not completely accepted by the audience or misunderstood. Therefore, providing the jury with enough criminal backgroud records of the defendant will make it clear to understand in beased of what or why the jury's final decision was made.In conclusion, in the UK and Australia, a jury does not have access to a defendant's previous criminal records, and some law representatives claim that this should be reverted. I fully agree with this statement since being provided with this documents will allow the jury a more understanding of the defendant's behaviour, and the final jury's decision will be easier to understand for the audience.;"The current practice in British and Australian laws of withholding a defendant's past criminal record from a jury in a criminal case is a contentious issue. While some lawyers argue that juries should have access to all past facts, the majority of legal experts disagree. I also disagree with the suggestion to change this practice.The primary reason for withholding a defendant's past record is to prevent prejudice and ensure a fair trial. If a jury is aware of a defendant's previous crimes, they may be influenced to assume the defendant's guilt, regardless of the evidence presented in the current case. This could lead to wrongful convictions and undermine the principles of justice. For instance, a defendant with a history of theft may be more likely to be found guilty of a subsequent theft charge, even if the evidence is circumstantial.Furthermore, allowing juries to consider a defendant's past record could also lead to inconsistent verdicts. Different juries may weigh the importance of past crimes differently, resulting in unequal treatment of defendants. This would compromise the integrity of the justice system and create uncertainty for both defendants and victims.In contrast, the current system ensures that juries focus solely on the evidence presented in the case at hand, rather than being swayed by a defendant's history. This approach upholds the fundamental principle of ""innocent until proven guilty"" and allows for a more objective assessment of the evidence. Ultimately, I believe that the current practice of withholding a defendant's past record from juries is essential to maintaining a fair and just legal system."
1308;Professional sportsmen and sportswomen and professional entertainers can often command enormous salaries today and this situation reflects society’s dependence on being entertained.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is no secret that today’s entertainment industry is extremely popular, with nearly everyone being engaged at some time in watching TV shows, movies and sports games. The North American sports industry alone generates a massive $67.7 billion every year. With the present emphasis on entertainment, sportsmen and women and professional entertainers can earn enormous salaries, with figures in the millions for one game, appearance or film. This situation certainly does reflect today’s society’s obsession with entertainment.Many people argue that celebrities do not deserve such payment when work in other professions considered of equal or higher value to society is underpaid. A-list celebrities can make over $20 million per movie, whilst many average workers can barely make ends meet. Of course there are lots of people who say that there are better ways the money could be used, rather than allowing such a vast amount to go to just one person. This is a fairly naive point of view, though. So long as people wish to watch entertainment, advertising in turn will be present and the most watched celebrities will be able to earn high salaries, as their presence will ensure the high viewing figures the advertisers desire.Though celebrities and sportsmen and sportswomen often make very large sums of money, it can also be seen as unfair to say that they do not deserve it or propose their money be used for something else. While it is true that they did not find a cure for cancer or made a life-changing scientific discovery, their hard work and expertise created a product that the public wants to see and the high payment merely reflects their value.In conclusion, it is clear that today’s society is indeed a society obsessed with being entertained and the high salaries paid to those who entertain society clearly reflect this. The high payments, however, are not necessarily out of place or undeserved.;The notion that professional sportsmen and sportswomen, as well as entertainers, can command enormous salaries due to society's dependence on entertainment, is a topic of ongoing debate. In my opinion, I agree to a large extent that this statement holds true. The astronomical salaries earned by celebrities and sports personalities are a testament to the significant value society places on entertainment.On one hand, the salaries of professional athletes and entertainers are a reflection of the massive revenue generated by the entertainment industry. For instance, top footballers like Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi earn tens of millions of dollars annually, not just from their clubs, but also from endorsement deals. Similarly, A-list actors like Dwayne Johnson and Leonardo DiCaprio command hefty sums for their movie roles. This is because millions of people around the world are willing to pay to watch them perform, whether it's on the field or on the big screen. The high demand for entertainment, combined with the limited supply of exceptionally talented individuals, contributes to the inflated salaries.On the other hand, one could argue that these salaries are not entirely justified, and that they reflect a societal imbalance in priorities. For example, teachers, nurses, and other essential professionals who contribute significantly to society's well-being often earn relatively modest salaries. This raises questions about the true value we place on different professions and the impact of celebrity culture on our perceptions of worth and success.In conclusion, while I acknowledge that the entertainment industry does generate significant revenue and that exceptional talent deserves fair compensation, I also believe that the disparity between the salaries of entertainers and other crucial professionals is a concern. Society's dependence on entertainment is undeniable, but it is crucial to reassess our priorities and ensure that we value and reward all professions according to their true worth to society.
1311;Providing a national system in a country where the unemployed receive a regular payment only encourages people not to seek work and puts an unreasonable strain on a country’s financial resources.Discuss this statement and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;In modern day society, money is a driving force for nearly everyone. Most people aspire to be financially secure and to have the ability to live the life they want. However, not everyone is able to find paid employment, and for that reason in some countries around the world, governments have initiated a system where the unemployed receive a regular payment to enable them to survive. Some people believe it is an excellent idea, whilst others believe that it is exhausting a country’s financial resources.When looking at the positive aspects of this system, it can be said that it prevents individuals from having a private bankruptcy. When somebody becomes unemployed, he or she will have on-going costs such as rent for a dwelling, bills for water, telephone and electricity as well as the cost of food and several other things. Without a salary, this person will fall into debt, because they will be unable to cover these expenses. A national unemployment payment system will therefore prevent this person from losing nearly everything over time. Without such system, many people would become homeless and would potentially engage in criminal activities to survive. Therefore, one can say that this system is positive. Although stories are heard of people exploiting the system, usually the newly unemployed want to find a job fast in order to become financially independent again, meaning that the government does not have to support them for long.Although there are positive aspects of this system, one can also say that if the payment made by the government is too high, it will prevent people from looking for work actively. Occasionally, the payment people receive is higher than their potential salaries, deterring them from working and creating an on-going cost for the government. A potential solution for this could be providing free training and employment support to open up new career opportunities with higher income, which would motivate this group to re-enter the workforce.In conclusion, the unemployment benefits system has positive and negative aspects. Personally, I believe that the positive effects of the system outweigh the negative. The payment must remain on a level that helps people survive without regular salaries, but does not seem attractive to exploit over a longer period of time.;The notion that providing a national system of regular payments to the unemployed discourages them from seeking work and overburdens a country's finances is a contentious issue. While some argue that such a system can foster dependency and reduce the incentive to work, the reality is more complex. In my opinion, a well-designed system of unemployment benefits can be a vital safety net that supports individuals during periods of job transition, rather than a disincentive to work.On one hand, it is true that an overly generous system of unemployment benefits can potentially reduce the motivation to seek employment. If benefits are too high or last too long, they might create a dependency culture where individuals prefer to rely on government support rather than actively seeking work. For instance, some critics point to the high unemployment rates in some European countries with extensive welfare systems as evidence of this effect. However, it's crucial to note that the relationship between unemployment benefits and work incentives is not straightforward. Many individuals face significant barriers to employment, such as lack of skills, job availability in their area, or health issues, and benefits can provide a necessary lifeline during these times.On the other hand, a balanced system of unemployment benefits can actually facilitate the job search process by allowing individuals to dedicate time to finding a suitable position rather than taking any job out of desperation. This can lead to better job matches, increased productivity, and ultimately, a healthier economy. For example, countries like Denmark, with its flexicurity model, combine generous unemployment benefits with active labor market policies that encourage job search and provide training. This approach has been associated with high employment rates and low unemployment durations, suggesting that with the right design, a national system of unemployment payments can support rather than hinder the labor market. Furthermore, in times of economic downturn, unemployment benefits can serve as an automatic stabilizer, injecting money into the economy and helping to mitigate the worst effects of recession.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the potential for unemployment benefits to discourage work, a thoughtfully designed system can play a crucial role in supporting individuals and the broader economy. Rather than abandoning such systems, countries should focus on crafting policies that balance support for the unemployed with incentives and resources to help them return to work, thereby promoting a more resilient and equitable labor market.
1314;Public health is becoming an urgent issue nowadays. Some argue that governments should create nutrition and food choice laws to improve public health, while others believe that it is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Public health has become an increasingly pressing issue in the modern world, with many populations facing rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related diseases. This has led to a debate as to whether governments should establish nutrition and food choice laws for the betterment of public health or if it solely falls on individuals to make wise choices. In my view, everyone should take ownership of their diet and assume responsibility for their health because it is the right choice.The argument for government-imposed nutrition and food choice laws is that they could help prevent people from making unhealthy choices which could lead to more serious illnesses down the line. For example, government regulations could limit the amount of sugar or fats allowed in food products, especially those marketed to children, and impose taxes on unhealthy snacks like chips and candy bars. This approach would also benefit those who lack the knowledge about healthy food, necessary to make informed decisions. By providing clear guidelines on what foods are healthy, and by taxing the unhealthy options higher, the government would steer individuals away from unhealthy options.However, there are also some valid arguments against governmental intervention. These types of regulations infringe upon individuals’ right to choose what they put in their bodies. After all, everyone should be free to make lifestyle choices for themselves. Additionally, there may not be enough evidence to suggest that overly restrictive regulations would have beneficial effects on public health outcomes in the long run. Since people’s love of unhealthy food is often considered an addiction, it is unlikely that a higher price or other warnings would be enough to deter individuals from purchasing unhealthy food items.In conclusion, while there can certainly be benefits associated with implementing nutrition and food choice laws at a governmental level, ultimately it should still come down to personal choice and responsibility as far as one’s diet is concerned. Governments should instead focus on providing citizens with better nutrition education, so that they can make better informed decisions about what they consume. This way, they can receive the information they need while still having autonomy over their own diets and lifestyles.;The issue of public health has become a pressing concern in recent years, with many arguing that governments should intervene to promote healthy eating habits. On one hand, some people believe that governments should create nutrition and food choice laws to improve public health. This could include measures such as restricting the sale of unhealthy foods, as well as implementing taxation on sugary drinks and junk food. Proponents of this view argue that such laws would help to reduce the incidence of diet-related diseases, such as obesity and diabetes, and ultimately lead to a healthier population.On the other hand, some individuals believe that what people eat is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. They argue that governments should not interfere with people's freedom to choose what they eat, and that education and awareness campaigns are a more effective way to promote healthy eating habits. According to this view, individuals should be free to make their own decisions about their diet, without government intervention.In my opinion, while personal choice and responsibility are important, governments also have a role to play in promoting public health. Governments can create an environment that supports healthy eating habits, such as providing subsidies for fresh fruits and vegetables, and regulating the food industry to ensure that unhealthy foods are not aggressively marketed. By taking a balanced approach that combines education, awareness, and regulation, governments can help to improve public health without infringing on personal freedoms. Ultimately, a collaborative effort between governments, individuals, and the food industry is necessary to tackle the complex issue of public health and promote a healthier society.
267;Reporting of crimes and other kinds of violent news on television and in newspapers can have adverse consquences. This kind of information should be restricted from being shown in the media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Reporting violent crimes and other violent issues could represents a adverse consequence sometimes. Overall, it is important to enphasyded that people are geting more and more violant and we can't blame only media as a mainly factor for those behavior.This kind of questions is almost a phylosical one and we will keeping this doubt for a long time, or even never now if people are becoming more agressive because they are more expousure to this kind of news, or if we are having more report regarding to violence just because people are getting more violent.I believe that people could feel estimulated to be a criminous person when they have a minimium certain that they won't be punish.For instance, stolen and other minimius crimes had increase at california region after they anounced that stolen under tham $1000 are consider a crime anymore. So the sensation that people could do anything wrong and that is no penalty for that, estimulates the number for stolen.In other hand, when we see some hardly rules the number of crime are dipest low, as we can see at Dubai, for instance. As all penalties are really hard and strongly implemented this place is considering highest safe.I bilieve that restricting any kind of information be showen in the media doesn't solve the problem, and, in fact, bring another new problem related to limited population information. When people know what are happening, type of crimes, etc, they could be prepare to handle with those problems and prevent theirselves.;The reporting of crimes and violent news on television and in newspapers has sparked intense debate about its potential consequences on society. While some argue that such information should be restricted, I partially disagree with this statement. On the one hand, the unrestricted reporting of violent news can have severe psychological impacts on audiences, particularly children and vulnerable individuals. Exposure to graphic and disturbing content can lead to increased fear, anxiety, and desensitization to violence. Moreover, the excessive coverage of crimes can also create a culture of voyeurism, where the public is more interested in the sensational aspects of a crime rather than the underlying social issues that led to it.On the other hand, restricting the reporting of crimes and violent news can undermine the principles of a free press and the public's right to know. The media plays a crucial role in informing citizens about important issues and holding those in power accountable. By reporting on crimes and violent incidents, the media can raise awareness about social problems, such as crime rates, police brutality, or inadequate mental health services. This can lead to public debate, advocacy, and ultimately, positive change. Furthermore, responsible and balanced reporting can also provide a platform for victims' voices to be heard and for support services to be promoted.In conclusion, while I acknowledge the potential adverse consequences of reporting crimes and violent news, I believe that a complete restriction is not the solution. Instead, the media should strive for responsible and balanced reporting, avoiding sensationalism and graphic content. By doing so, the media can fulfill its duty to inform the public while minimizing harm and promoting a more informed and empathetic society. Ultimately, a balanced approach to reporting crimes and violent news is necessary to ensure that the public is informed without being harmed.
1;Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Poverty represents a worldwide crisis. It is the ugliest epidemic in a region, which could infect countries in the most debilitating ways. To tackle this issue, rich countries need to help those in need and give a hand when possible. I agree that there are several ways of aiding poor countries other than financial aid, like providing countries in need with engineers, workers, and soldiers who would build infrastructure. Building universities, hospitals, and roadways. By having a solid infrastructure, poor countries would be able to monetise their profits and build a stronger and more profitable economy which would help them in the long term. Once unprivilged countries find their niche, the major hurdle would be passed and would definitely pave the way for much brighter future. However, I do disagree that financial aid does not solve poverty, it does if used properly and efficiently. The most determining factor if financial aid would be the way to go, is by identifying what type of poor countries' representative are dealing with. Some countries will have a responsible leader and some will not, with that being said, implementing a strategy, to distinguish responsible leaders from others, would tailor the type of aid rich countries could use. An example, A clear report and constant observation would be applied to track the progress and how this type of aid is being monetized. In summary, types of aid varies from country to another, and tailoring the type of aid is of paramount importance to solve this problem that had huge toll on poor countries.;The notion that financial aid from rich countries to poor ones does not effectively alleviate poverty has sparked a debate on the most suitable form of assistance. While some argue that developed countries should focus on providing alternative forms of help, I partially agree with this statement. On the one hand, financial aid can have limitations in addressing the root causes of poverty. It may be mismanaged or squandered by corrupt governments, or it might create dependency rather than self-sufficiency. Moreover, non-financial aid such as expertise, technology, and education can have a more profound and lasting impact on a country's development. For instance, providing training and skills development programs can empower local communities to drive their own economic growth and reduce reliance on external assistance.On the other hand, financial aid can still be crucial in emergency situations or for specific development projects. In times of natural disasters or humanitarian crises, immediate financial assistance is necessary to save lives and provide basic necessities. Furthermore, well-targeted financial aid can support key infrastructure projects, such as building schools, hospitals, or roads, which are essential for a country's long-term development.In conclusion, while I agree that developed countries should consider providing other types of help, such as technical assistance and capacity-building programs, alongside or instead of financial aid, I do not believe that financial aid should be completely ruled out. A balanced approach that combines financial assistance with other forms of support, tailored to the specific needs and context of each poor country, is likely to be the most effective way to address poverty and promote sustainable development. Ultimately, a one-size-fits-all solution does not exist, and a nuanced strategy that incorporates a variety of aid types is necessary to make a meaningful difference in the fight against poverty.
1381;Schools should select students by their academic abilities, agree or disagree?;Some people think that schools should select students according to their academic abilities, while others believe that it is better to have students with different abilities studying together. Discuss both views and state your own opinion.Some people contend that mixed ability classes are more beneficial for children’s development than streaming them on the basis of judgement about their academic abilities. However, from my perspective, I disagree with this contention.Admittedly, mixed ability classes provide a better environment for children’s all-round development. In such classes, children with different abilities study together and in turn they can learn from one another. From example, a student, who is good at academic study but weak in dancing or painting, can learn how to dance or paint his peers. In this sense, mixed ability classes allow students to develop their abilities in different subjects instead of only academic abilities.Despite the argument above, I believe streaming students brings more benefits to teachers and students. As for teachers, separating children with better academic abilities from others facilitates effective teaching. This practice helps teachers to control their students more conveniently and easily. Compared with mixed ability in which teacher should consider students’ differences when they are using teaching methodologies, streaming makes this situation simpler. To be more specific, students are at the same level of academic ability in a class, and in turn teachers can use the same methodologies for them all. In this way, the narrower the spread of ability in the class, the more convenient the teaching can be.On top of this, enables students to learn in an effective way. According to students’ different abilities, they are taught in different ways that are more suitable for them. In the top streams, students use more difficult materials, therefore, they can learn more. In sharp contrast, teachers can explain the material more slowly to those in bottom streams. Under this circumstance, students with different academic abilities can study effectively and efficiently.In the final analysis, mixed ability classes are beneficial for students’ versatile development, but in my opinion, segregating students based on different academic ability is better for both teachers and students.The writer presented a balanced discussion of the topic, effortlessly delivered in a form of a fluent, well-written IELTS essay. The arguments and reasoning are laid out in a coherent, logical way. A wide range of vocabulary is used in this work. There are very few spelling errors that could have been caught in an additional round of proofreading (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). Keep up the good work! Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;The question of whether schools should select students based on their academic abilities has sparked a long-standing debate. While some argue that selecting students by their academic abilities can foster a more effective learning environment, others contend that it can lead to social and emotional disparities. In my opinion, I disagree with the notion that schools should select students based on their academic abilities.Selecting students by their academic abilities can lead to a narrow and elitist approach to education. This approach can result in students who are not as academically gifted being relegated to inferior schools or programs, which can have a devastating impact on their self-esteem and motivation. Furthermore, it can also create a system where students are pigeonholed into specific categories, limiting their potential and opportunities for growth.Moreover, selecting students by their academic abilities can also perpetuate social inequalities. Students from disadvantaged backgrounds may not have had the same access to resources and opportunities, which can put them at a significant disadvantage when it comes to academic selection. This can result in a system where students from affluent backgrounds are more likely to be selected for top schools, exacerbating existing social and economic inequalities.Instead of selecting students by their academic abilities, the education system should focus on providing inclusive and supportive learning environments that cater to the diverse needs and abilities of all students. This can be achieved by implementing policies and programs that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion, such as mixed-ability classrooms and personalized learning plans. By doing so, schools can provide students with a more holistic and well-rounded education that prepares them for success in all aspects of life, not just academics. Ultimately, the goal of education should be to provide students with the skills, knowledge, and support they need to reach their full potential, regardless of their academic abilities.
1337;Scientists believe that the world is in danger due to environmental changes. Some people say that personal lifestyle changes should be made to reduce the damage to environment, while others think that the government should do something to help. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Environmental problems are clearly something that is often discussed in today’s world. One part of the society claims that individuals should change their habits and lifestyle to improve the ecological situation. Others, on the other hand, believe that this issue should be solved on the governmental level. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and my perspective will be offered.It is hard to deny that human kind is responsible for the current environmental situation, and it seems impossible to achieve any noticeable result in this field without the participation of vast majority of individuals. For instance, a simple lifestyle change such as introducing the separation of household rubbish can make recycling projects more convenient and efficient. Moreover, consumers can reduce their usage of plastic items and, in turn, less plastic waste will contaminate the environment.However, many people still feel that the government has more tools to prevent environmental changes. One option that the authorities have is to discourage citizens from using personal vehicles by charging high taxes and additional fees. Moreover, politicians usually have access to resources to educate people about environmental problems and promote the most important ecological projects on all levels, ranging from special courses at schools to TV shows and websites related to this topic. Furthermore, it is a key responsibility of the government to protect the environment by spending state funds on research and modern equipment. Countries where legislation protects the ecology, for example Norway, have achieved visible results and overcame most environmental problems.In conclusion, I believe that a combined approach will work best to prevent or reverse environmental changes. A contribution of every individual is just as important as the intervention from the government in order to fix existing issues and save our planet for future generations.;The world is indeed facing a pressing issue due to environmental changes, as emphasized by scientists. The debate surrounding the best course of action to mitigate this damage has sparked a heated discussion between individuals who believe personal lifestyle changes are the key and those who think government intervention is necessary. On the one hand, the argument that personal lifestyle changes can significantly reduce environmental damage holds some merit. Simple actions such as reducing plastic use, using public transport, or recycling can collectively make a substantial difference when adopted by a large number of people. Furthermore, personal lifestyle changes promote awareness and set an example for others to follow, potentially leading to a grassroots movement towards sustainability.On the other hand, there are those who argue that government action is paramount in addressing environmental issues. Governments have the power to implement policies and laws that can drastically reduce pollution and waste on a much larger scale than individual actions. For instance, governments can enforce stricter regulations on industries, invest in renewable energy, and launch nationwide campaigns to raise awareness and promote sustainable practices.In my opinion, a combination of both personal lifestyle changes and government action is the most effective way to combat environmental changes. While personal actions can contribute to the solution, they are often limited in scope and impact. Government intervention, on the other hand, can provide the necessary framework and resources to tackle environmental issues on a national and global scale. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals to make conscious lifestyle choices and for governments to enact and enforce environmental policies to protect our planet for future generations.
1373;Senior managers should have higher salaries than other employees (agree/disagree);In many countries senior positions have higher salaries compared to those of young workers of the same company. Some people think this isn’t justified. Do you agree or disagree?While some believe that rewarding those in managerial positions with higher pay packets is appropriate, not everyone agrees with this view. Personally, I am leaning towards the latter position due to negative impacts caused by significant difference in salaries within a company.For one, executive officers should know that higher than sufficient salaries are not necessary. Indeed, the higher the remuneration they receive, the more likely the company to suffer from devoid of financial capability. Furthermore, they often gain powers that money can’t buy. For instance, they often make important decisions over how to make their company thrive. They are also entitled to allocate company’s budget and designate tasks to other workers. these non-financial entitlements, they should refrain from earning more than reasonable amounts as salaries.Unreasonably high salaries granted to the executives can also afflict other employees. In fact, it is foreseeable that many employees would feel powerless or even when they find out about the huge salary gap between the executive officers’ and theirs. Accordingly, some may leave the company, and others may go on to strike and demand a pay increase. However, those actions . Therefore, unfair salary systems like this would yield unhealthy working environment for both employers and employees.In conclusion, I oppose to those in managerial roles with obscene amounts of compensation because it can cost the company its prosperity and discourage other employees . Thus it is recommended for the company to decide on the salaries of executive officers and general workers by adopting a more motivating salary system.This is a good example of an IELTS Band 8 essay. The task statement is sufficiently discussed, and the writer’s arguments are relevant and well developed. There are only 2 body paragraphs, but they are coherent and help to organise the information. Linking words are used appropriately to sequence ideas. Skillful use of synonyms throughout the essay demonstrates the writer’s vocabulary. Some of the expressions used aren’t entirely suitable or accurate, but there aren’t many of them. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.0.;I agree that senior managers should have higher salaries than other employees. This is because senior managers typically hold significant responsibilities within an organization, such as making strategic decisions, overseeing departments, and driving business growth. Their roles often require a high level of expertise, a strong ability to lead, and the capacity to handle complex and high-pressure situations.One of the primary reasons senior managers should earn higher salaries is due to their impact on the organization's success. Their decisions and leadership directly influence the company's profitability, growth, and competitiveness in the market. As such, their compensation should reflect the value they bring to the organization. Higher salaries serve as an incentive for senior managers to perform at their best, motivating them to make decisions that benefit the company's long-term interests.Furthermore, senior managers often possess advanced degrees and extensive experience, which are costly and time-consuming to acquire. Their higher salaries are, in part, a reflection of the investment they have made in their education and career development. It is also a way for companies to attract and retain top talent in executive positions, as the job market for senior management roles is highly competitive.In addition, the hierarchy of salaries within a company is a traditional and logical structure that reflects the differing levels of responsibility and contribution. Junior employees learn from and are supported by their senior colleagues, and as they grow in their careers and take on more responsibility, their salaries should similarly increase. This structure not only motivates employees to aim for higher positions but also maintains a sense of fairness and progression within the organization.In conclusion, given the significant responsibilities, the requirement for advanced skills and experience, and the need to reflect the value they add to the organization, senior managers should indeed have higher salaries than other employees. This not only serves as a motivator and a form of recognition but also as a necessary component of the organizational structure that aligns rewards with responsibilities and performance.
1357;Should employers pay more attention to personal qualities rather than qualifications?;"While recruiting a new employee, the employer should pay more attention to their personal qualities, rather than qualifications and experience. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and include relevant examples.Recent decades have witnessed a burgeoning growth of numerous industries; therefore, recruiting the right person for the position is crucial to the development of enterprises. But how do we determine if a person is the best fit? Advocates of conventional recruitment methods opine that this candidate must have sufficient experience and qualifications needed for that job. Nevertheless, some people argue that candidates’ personal qualities cannot be ignored. In my view, both components are of equal importance.To begin with, the conventional approach of checking potential workers’ qualifications via their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, issued qualifications and certifications from authorised organisations is vital. Apparently, whenever we submit a job application, we are always required to attach a CV while a cover letter is optional. Without a decent qualification, even if that candidate’s personal characteristics are suitable, the enterprise will need to carry out lots of skill trainings eventually.On the other hand, occasionally during an interview some HR officers ignore the significance of assessing how candidates’ individual qualities can fit in the company. Employers should assess not only candidates’ qualifications but also their enabling skills, ethics and value propositions. The more an employee’s personal qualities fit in a company’s culture and values, the more he or she is motivated to contribute to that company’s vision. KPMG is a great example of evaluating candidates’ personal qualifications and skills by utilising a game-based assessment process, followed by a video interview. This methodology enables a comprehensive assessment, and is embraced by many companies nowadays.To summarise, employers should assess both personal characteristics and formal qualifications when recruiting people as each of these elements has its own vital contribution to make in talent-seeking enterprises.This response covers the topic well. The writer’s position is clearly expressed and supported by an example, the use of paragraphing makes this essay organised and easy to follow. Linking words are used appropriately. The use of complex sentences and advanced vocabulary is impressive. Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.";The debate over whether employers should prioritize personal qualities over qualifications has gained significant attention in recent years. While qualifications are often seen as a key indicator of a candidate's ability to perform a job, it is argued that personal qualities such as teamwork, communication skills, and adaptability are equally, if not more, important.Qualifications provide a snapshot of a candidate's academic and technical abilities, but they do not necessarily reflect their personality, work ethic, or ability to work with others. In many cases, a candidate with excellent qualifications may struggle to work effectively in a team or communicate complex ideas to colleagues and clients. On the other hand, a candidate with strong personal qualities such as empathy, resilience, and a positive attitude may be able to learn and adapt quickly, even if they lack formal qualifications.Furthermore, prioritizing personal qualities can lead to a more diverse and inclusive workforce. By looking beyond qualifications, employers can attract candidates from non-traditional backgrounds who may bring unique perspectives and experiences to the workplace. This, in turn, can foster innovation, creativity, and problem-solving, leading to improved business outcomes.In conclusion, while qualifications are important, employers should pay more attention to personal qualities when hiring. By doing so, they can build a team that is not only skilled and knowledgeable but also motivated, adaptable, and able to work effectively together. This approach can lead to improved job satisfaction, reduced turnover, and increased productivity, ultimately benefiting both the employer and the employee. As such, it is time for employers to rethink their hiring strategies and prioritize the personal qualities that truly make a candidate stand out.
1385;Should people spend a lot on weddings and birthday parties?;"Some people think that spending a lot on holding wedding parties, birthday parties and other celebrations is just a waste of money. Others, however, think that these are necessary for individuals and the society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Throwing parties can be expensive. While some people do not find these fancy gatherings worth what they cost, others believe such events are important to both individuals and the society.People choose to throw parties for a number of reasons. For starters, they can make better teams. Project kick-off parties are good opportunities to break the ice and help team members to know each other better. Celebrating a victory create a sense of success and belonging. Companies do not see parties as of money and allocate budget to support such events; moreover, they often leave good memories. From our own experiences, we all have happy memories of our birthday parties when we were little. Every family has great photos at family gatherings in their album. In addition, contrary to what some people believe that spending on parties is a waste of social resources, they actually create value, either by employing people in the party-planning business or by offering people better experiences.The popularity of parties, however, causes some tension in the society. They are hard on introverted people who find themselves uncomfortable in the crowd. This is a clinic symptom which psychologists call “social anxiety disorder”. There are other ways to celebrate important events that may have greater value for their cost. For instance, companies could send out gifts after successful projects and parents could take their children on family trips to celebrate birthdays.In my opinion, while a party is a form of social event that brings many benefits to individuals and the society, other choices should also be considered, either to cut spending or to relieve the stress of those who are not fond of crowded celebrations.This is a very good essay. Other than minor inaccuracies there are no problems (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). Seems to be worth IELTS Band 8.";The question of whether people should spend a lot on weddings and birthday parties is a debated topic. On one hand, some argue that these special occasions are once-in-a-lifetime events that deserve to be celebrated in a grand manner. A lavish wedding or birthday party can create lifelong memories for the individual and their guests. Moreover, it can also be seen as a way to show love, respect, and appreciation for the person being celebrated. In many cultures, big weddings and birthday parties are a status symbol, and people feel pressure to spend heavily to maintain their social standing.On the other hand, others argue that spending excessively on weddings and birthday parties is unnecessary and wasteful. The money spent on these events could be better utilized for more practical purposes such as saving for the future, paying off debts, or donating to charity. Furthermore, expensive weddings and birthday parties often lead to financial stress and debt for the hosts, which can have long-term negative consequences. Additionally, the pressure to spend heavily on these events can lead to unnecessary stress and anxiety, taking away from the true meaning and joy of the celebration.In conclusion, while it's understandable to want to celebrate special occasions in a grand manner, the decision to spend a lot on weddings and birthday parties should be made with careful consideration of one's financial situation and priorities. Perhaps a more balanced approach would be to celebrate these occasions in a way that is meaningful and enjoyable, yet also responsible and sustainable. This could involve setting a realistic budget, prioritizing what's truly important, and focusing on the joy and love of the celebration rather than the price tag.
1393;Should the same laws which prohibit the sale and consumption of heroin be applied to tobacco? Discuss.;Recently, a heated debate when a few reputable health organizations suggested the application of a similar act of heroin selling and usage prohibition . In this , I will analyze why the adoption of such a law could be a breakthrough in our youngsters’ safety, according to my vision.Firstly, tobacco does not differ much from heroin when it comes to the addictive effect. , the active ingredient in tobacco, exerts its effect by acting directly on smoker’s brain cells. Numerous experiments carried out by on animals, rats, proved that this toxic chemical does lead time to dependency, similarly to the effect experienced with .Secondly, the restriction on selling would surely show an instant decline in tobacco smoking. ” Having easy access to cigarettes puts a tremendous pressure, especially on teenagers,to resist such a temptation” Dr.Hisham , head of department at Alexandria Medical college , states firmly. “Giving the new generation the sense that the severity of smoking is to other lethal drugs usage be a life saving step, they will thank us for as they get older.” he continues.To recapitulate, applying of a futuristic law such as the suggested one will have a positive impact ,not only on young people’s health but on our society as a whole.;The application of laws prohibiting the sale and consumption of heroin to tobacco is a complex and debated issue. On one hand, both heroin and tobacco are substances that pose significant health risks to users. Tobacco, in particular, is responsible for millions of deaths worldwide each year, primarily due to smoking-related illnesses such as lung cancer and heart disease. Given the detrimental effects of tobacco, it could be argued that the same stringent laws applied to heroin should also be applied to tobacco, to protect public health.On the other hand, there are significant differences between heroin and tobacco that make a direct comparison challenging. Heroin is an illicit drug with no recognized medical use and a high potential for abuse, leading to addiction and severe societal problems. In contrast, tobacco, although highly addictive and harmful, has been a legally available substance for centuries, with a vast industry built around its production and sale. Applying the same laws as those for heroin to tobacco would require a radical shift in societal and legal attitudes towards tobacco, essentially criminalizing a behavior that, although unhealthy, is deeply ingrained in many cultures.Furthermore, a blanket application of heroin laws to tobacco could lead to unintended consequences, such as the creation of a black market for tobacco products, similar to what is seen with heroin. This could result in increased criminal activity, less safe products being sold, and a lack of regulation and taxation that currently helps to fund public health initiatives.In conclusion, while the health risks associated with tobacco warrant stringent regulations, directly applying the laws that prohibit the sale and consumption of heroin to tobacco may not be the most effective or practical approach. A more nuanced strategy, focusing on strict regulation, public education, and cessation support, may better balance the need to protect public health with the realities of tobacco use and the potential consequences of over-criminalization.
1394;Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth with poorer nations by providing them with things such as food and education? Or is this the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens?;I think that wealthy nations should be required to share their wealth with poorer nations. at providing such things as food and education because of the three following reasons.Firstly, citizens of both wealthy nations and poorer nations are human beings. Therefore, we can not look at, hear of, or talk about people who lack food, education, without compassion and sympathy. Sharing wealth with poorer nations is not only a good deed but is also a .Secondly, many nations in Africa and Asia are poor. Famine, diseases, crime and illiteracy are killing the citizens of these countries. , many nations in Europe and America are rich. If there are no actions taken, this inequality will increase dramatically. Poor countries will become poorer while rich countries will become richer. As a result, the poorest countries will become slaves of the richest countries. So, sharing wealth is useful way to prevent people from that bad future.Thirdly, although sharing wealth with poorer nations is very necessarythis help should only stop at providing such things as food, medicine and education. Or else, poor nations may become dependent on the aid. They may lose enthusiasm to build their countries by themselves. Moreover, rich nations can take advantage of sharing wealth to interfere with the governance of poor nations’. This can’t be considered a humane action and should be prevented.In my opinion, sharing wealth with poorer nations has both a bad side and a good side. What we have to do is its bad side and its good side.;The debate on whether wealthy nations should share their wealth with poorer nations has been a longstanding one. On one hand, it can be argued that wealthy nations have a moral obligation to assist poorer nations, as they have a greater capacity to do so. Providing food and education to those in need can help alleviate poverty and improve living standards, thereby promoting global stability and prosperity. Wealthy nations can afford to spare a fraction of their wealth to support development projects and humanitarian aid in poorer nations.On the other hand, it can be argued that the primary responsibility of providing for citizens lies with the governments of poorer nations themselves. These governments have the closest understanding of their nation's specific needs and challenges, and are best placed to implement effective solutions. External aid, though well-intentioned, can sometimes create dependency rather than self-sufficiency. Moreover, the effectiveness of aid is often hindered by corruption, bureaucratic inefficiencies, and lack of infrastructure in the recipient countries.However, a balanced approach could be the most effective solution. Wealthy nations can provide strategic support, such as capacity building, technology transfer, and policy guidance, to help poorer nations develop their own capabilities and resources. This way, the autonomy and self-determination of poorer nations are respected, while they still receive necessary assistance to overcome immediate challenges. Ultimately, a combination of internal effort from the governments of poorer nations and external support from wealthy nations is likely to yield the most sustainable and equitable outcomes. By working together, the global community can make significant strides towards reducing poverty and inequality, and fostering a more just and prosperous world for all.
1302;Social media has become a real problem for some young people today, and governments should create laws that allow only people over 18 years of age to have accounts.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Social media today is extremely significant to a majority of the population, especially the younger generation. Many teenagers find it exceptionally convenient and necessary for communication and entertainment. However, not everyone is able to use social media responsibly, which gave rise to the idea of making it accessible to only those older than eighteen years of age.Though there are negatives, such as cyber-bullying, or being too distracted by these modern media, there are issues surrounding most things in life. It is a choice to go onto a social media website, and many younger people are capable of managing accounts without any difficulties. It is not the government’s responsibility to monitor under eighteen-year olds; that is for the parents.Statistics show that over eighty per cent of teens use a form of online social media. It allows them to chat online, easily stay in contact with friends and family across the world, and see updates on others’ lives (through text, photos or videos). Social media is a way to express thoughts or ideas and to stay in contact with the rest of the world.To not permit one of the largest Internet-using demographics to use social media because a few people have problems with it is an irrational and an unfair restriction. Not only would profit be lost with fewer users, but controlling who creates accounts and monitoring proof of age would be difficult as well. I believe that laws should not make social media inaccessible to young people under eighteen; this would be unnecessary and absurd.";The notion that social media has become a significant problem for young people today is a pressing concern that warrants attention. The statement suggests that governments should implement laws restricting social media account ownership to individuals over 18 years of age. While I understand the intention behind this proposal, I partially disagree with it.On one hand, it is undeniable that excessive social media exposure can have detrimental effects on minors, such as increased risk of cyberbullying, decreased attention span, and potential exposure to inappropriate content. For instance, a study by the Royal Society for Public Health found that social media use is associated with increased feelings of loneliness, sadness, and anxiety among young people. Implementing age restrictions could help mitigate these issues.On the other hand, I believe that a blanket ban on social media for individuals under 18 is not a practical or effective solution. Many young people use social media responsibly and for positive purposes, such as connecting with friends, accessing educational resources, and engaging in online communities that promote creativity and self-expression. Moreover, implementing such laws could be difficult to enforce, as minors could easily circumvent age restrictions by providing false information or using parental accounts.Instead of age restrictions, I propose that governments and social media platforms work together to create a safer online environment for young people. This could involve introducing robust age verification processes, enhancing online safety features, and promoting digital literacy among minors. Furthermore, parents and educators should play a more active role in guiding young people on responsible social media use and online etiquette. By adopting a multi-faceted approach, we can minimize the negative impacts of social media on young people without resorting to overly restrictive measures.
771;Society is based on rules and laws. If individuals were free to do whatever they want to do, it could not function. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?;It is commonly held that society can operate perfectly by a set of rules. It means that providing total freedom to people undoubtedly results in chaos with the further possibility of total collapse. I strongly agree with this point of view as I am in the opinion that rules play a significant role in creating a stable society. In this essay, this idea will be discussed in detail.Basically, a set of rules can be helpful to achieve productive results in such essential areas as medicine and construction. For example, it is necessary to develop common procedures of operations in surgery or traffic rules for public transport. Unless there are not standardized, it might cause a lot of deaths or at least injuries. Constructing also should be based on common processes because comfort and safe accommodation is a necessity for many people. Although there are people who consider rules and laws limiting and imposing, it can be argued that they are critical in the organization of humanity.Laws are not obstacles on the way to people's freedom because they are established to regulate formal relationships when it is difficult to find a compromise informally. Moreover, they are vitally important when people face crime and violence. Without any system of justice solving crimes becomes more challenging. All criminal accidents tend to be out of control and spread around the world immediately. Shoplifting, robbery, and even disastrous wars can plunge our world into darkness. This way humanity might face total chaos where morals values and behavioral patterns are neglected. In this context, the word ‘society’ risks becoming totally meaningless, as its main definition is a 'group of people with common traditions and rules.'From the arguments presented above, one may conclude that any society needs standards, laws, or even moral principles. They form a foundation for safety, a good level of medicine, and science that allows to create a strong society and manage any difficulties or threats that may disturb people’s well-being.;The notion that society is based on rules and laws, and that individual freedom would lead to its downfall, is a widely debated topic. While I agree that rules and laws are essential for maintaining social order, I disagree that individuals should not be free to make their own choices.On one hand, rules and laws provide a framework for social behavior, ensuring that individuals respect the rights and freedoms of others. Without laws, societies would indeed be plagued by chaos and disorder, as individuals would be free to act on their impulses without consequences. For instance, laws against theft and violence protect citizens' property and safety, allowing them to live in a secure and stable environment.On the other hand, individual freedom is essential for personal growth, creativity, and innovation. If individuals were not free to make their own choices, societies would stagnate, and progress would be hindered. History has shown that some of the most significant advancements and discoveries were made by individuals who challenged conventional norms and rules. Moreover, individual freedom allows people to express themselves, pursue their passions, and contribute to the richness and diversity of society.In conclusion, while rules and laws are necessary for maintaining social order, I believe that individual freedom is equally important for the development and prosperity of society. A balance between the two is essential, where individuals are free to make their own choices, but also respect the rights and freedoms of others. By striking this balance, societies can foster creativity, innovation, and progress, while maintaining the stability and security that rules and laws provide. Ultimately, a society that values both individual freedom and social responsibility is one that is most likely to thrive and flourish.
1352;Some believe the government should take care of retirees, while others think everyone should save for their own retirement (opinion);Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.It is true that when people advance into their golden years, they require more help and attention. For that reason, a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly. However, I tend to agree with those who argue that workers should be saving a portion of their income to have a nest egg in their retirement.To begin with, a culture of saving rather than depending on the government may foster the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government. As a result, the government would be able to release more funds to more productive purposes, such as development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which may expedite the overall progression of a country.In addition to economic factors, putting money aside has some personal benefits. Since savings-oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses, this may instill a sense of self-respect and pride in them. On the other hand, those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma, as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society. Hence, to live a life with dignity and pride, taking responsibility for funding one’s own retirement is evidently a better option from individual perspective.In contrast, the provision of monetary outlays for retirees has proven unfeasible in many countries. Since in many nations the number of senior citizens is on the rise, in the long run governments are likely to struggle to sustain the cost of providing for the elderly. The early signs of this have been seen in many countries that were forced to raise the retirement age, including my home country where men can now retire at the age of 67 instead of 65. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, these kinds of support may become completely unsustainable.In conclusion, the provision of state monetary support may undoubtedly lessen the concern of retirees to some extent. However, considering the issue of sustainability of this provision, it is better to opt for individual savings from the very beginning of working life, for the benefit of both individual and national development.This response addresses all parts of the topic, by discussing the merits of funding one’s own retirement versus relying on government pension. The writer’s opinion has been stated as well and is very clear. The neat presentation of ideas has been helped by appropriate paragraphing, and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay. The author’s vocabulary seems to be rich and there is a variety of sentence structures used in this essay. Overall, this essay deserves an IELTS Band 8.;The debate surrounding retirement care has sparked intense discussion, with some arguing that the government should assume responsibility for retirees, while others believe individuals should be solely accountable for their own retirement savings. In my opinion, the latter stance is more practical and sustainable in the long run.On one hand, proponents of government-provided retirement care argue that it is a basic human right and that the state has a moral obligation to ensure the well-being of its elderly citizens. However, this approach can lead to an overwhelming financial burden on the government, potentially resulting in increased taxes or reallocation of funds from other essential public services. Furthermore, the ever-increasing life expectancy and retiring population can make it challenging for governments to maintain such a system without incurring significant debt.On the other hand, encouraging individuals to save for their own retirement promotes personal responsibility and financial literacy. By doing so, individuals can make informed decisions about their retirement plans, such as investing in pension schemes or other saving options, allowing them to secure their future without relying solely on government support. This approach also fosters a sense of independence and self-sufficiency among retirees, who can then enjoy their post-working life without financial stress. In conclusion, while the idea of government-provided retirement care may seem appealing, it is crucial for individuals to take charge of their retirement planning to avoid over-reliance on the state. By promoting a culture of personal saving and responsibility, we can ensure a more stable and secure future for retirees, allowing them to enjoy their golden years with dignity and financial peace of mind.
1398;Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree that this is the right course of action? Give reasons for your opinion.;, organization and companies as well as governments impose restrictions in work places and public amenities. It has become fashionable in the world today . I feel that smoking can be harmful, but I don’t think it should be forbidden completely. I would also argue that people should have the whether or not they should smoke.Allow me to present the three positive sides of smoking. Firstly, smoking certainly helps many people to relax. For some, it even improves concentration. If someone is upset or they have , to smoke to reduce the pressure or tension. people like to smoke when they are relaxing with friends. Secondly, governments throughout the world make huge profits from taxes on cigarettes. The income obtained through taxes provides funds which are used for building and public places such as parks, gardens, sports ground and foot paths. Thirdly, tobacco industry also employs tens of thousands of people all over the world, particularly in poorer countries such as Zimbabwe or the Philippines. Without cigarettes, these people would have no jobs.Despite these positive are lots of negative effects to smoking too. Initially, smoking has been proven to be very dangerous for health. cigarette contains more than 4000 chemical substances, therefore, it dangerous diseases such as heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis or lung cancer. According to a recent report in Britain close to 3,500 people are killed each year in road accidents and 120,000 are killed by smoking. Furthermore, smoking costs governments millions of dollars because of the large number of people who need treatment in hospitals for smoking-related problems. Moreover, passive smoking is also a major concern today. Recent research shows that non-smokers can suffer from health problems if they spend long periods of time among people who do smoke. In the UK children whose parents are are three times as likely to start smoking themselves .In short, I think the world would be a better place without cigarettes. However, the decision of whether smoke or not to smoke should be for each individual to make. I suggest that people should not smoke in a room or a place where there are non smokers, however they should be free to smoke elsewhere.;The debate on whether smoking should be prohibited in offices and public places has sparked intense discussion in recent years. In my opinion, I strongly agree that banning smoking in these areas is the right course of action. Firstly, the primary reason for this ban is to protect non-smokers from the harmful effects of second-hand smoke. Numerous studies have shown that passive smoking can cause serious health problems, including lung cancer and heart disease. By prohibiting smoking in offices and public places, governments and businesses can help reduce the risk of these health issues and create a healthier environment for everyone.Another reason for supporting this ban is that it can help reduce the number of smokers. When smoking is allowed in public places, it can normalize the behavior and make it more appealing to young people. By restricting smoking to private areas, governments can help de-normalize smoking and encourage people to quit. Furthermore, smoking bans can also help reduce the economic burden of smoking-related illnesses on healthcare systems. According to the World Health Organization, smoking is responsible for millions of deaths worldwide each year, and the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses is astronomical.In conclusion, I firmly believe that prohibiting smoking in offices and public places is the right course of action. The benefits of this ban, including protecting non-smokers from second-hand smoke, reducing the number of smokers, and decreasing the economic burden of smoking-related illnesses, far outweigh any potential drawbacks. As such, governments and businesses should continue to implement and enforce smoking bans to create a healthier and more sustainable environment for everyone.
665;Some cities create housing areas by providing taller buildings. Others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. What solution is better?;Some big cities, especially in Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama in Japan tend to build taller buildings like skyscrapers. Other local cities and places where are scarcely populated are built wider. This is quite understandable in terms of space, and there might be some solutions to dissipate populations around Japan.Initially, the main reason why people tend to gather in big cities is that there are many opportunities to get a job. There are famous headquarter companies and branches that are based in foreign countries. Therefore, more and more people move to the big cities so that many taller apartments and buildings are built to let them live in the limited space. There seems to be stressful due to people being densely populated, but infrastructures are well organized, especially transport, medical care, and security.In contrast, the population in the countryside becomes less. Therefore, there is plenty of space to build houses in the wider area. It seems to be well-relaxed and comfortable to live in a slow-paced lifestyle. But, it is apparently more difficult to obtain a new job, and lacking transport, so they need to rely on cars. In addition, the number of hospitals is much smaller than big cities. These issues are long controversial as a first world problem.Finally, as Covid-19 spread worldwide, many people are started to work at home with a lap top computer. Innumerable companies adopted IT systems that are able to work remotely. In addition, some companies had already stated this systemized working style will not change, however, Covid-19 completely ended. This means that many people do not necessarily need to live in big cities. Therefore, if the transport system is well organized, especially establishing and improving a train, which works faster and more frequently. This effort will be not only helpful to dissipate the population outside of the big cities, but also promotive to tackling with great infrastructures to countrysides.In conclusion, as a result, the densely populated cities will be able to reduce its population and increase the population in the countryside. As a result, some issues will be resolved and become well-balanced solutions. Finally, it might be able to build wider houses in big cities with reasonable prices than now.;The debate about the most effective solution for creating housing areas has sparked a longstanding discussion among urban planners and policymakers. Two primary approaches have emerged: constructing taller buildings and building houses on a wider area of land. While both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, the better solution depends on various factors, including the city's geography, its population density, and the residents' quality of life.On the one hand, constructing taller buildings, often referred to as high-rise or high-density development, offers several benefits. It allows for a significant increase in housing units while minimizing the amount of land required. This approach is particularly suitable for cities with limited land availability, such as those surrounded by water or mountains. Additionally, high-density development can promote more efficient use of resources, reduce transportation costs, and foster a sense of community among residents. However, it can also lead to increased costs, reduced natural light and ventilation, and higher maintenance expenses.On the other hand, building houses on a wider area of land, known as low-density or suburban development, provides an alternative solution. This approach allows for more spacious living arrangements, greater privacy, and a closer connection to nature. It is often preferred by families with children or those seeking a quieter, more peaceful living environment. Nonetheless, it requires more land, leading to higher infrastructure costs, increased transportation needs, and potential urban sprawl.Ultimately, the better solution depends on the specific needs and constraints of each city. A balanced approach that combines elements of both high-density and low-density development may offer the most effective solution. By incorporating taller buildings in central areas and preserving green spaces, cities can promote sustainability, efficiency, and a high quality of life for their residents. Therefore, urban planners should consider the unique characteristics of their city and adopt a flexible, mixed-use development strategy to create thriving, livable, and environmentally conscious housing areas.
11;Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Athletes to be on the top need to have high-end facilities that a country can provide for them to be able to improve their strengths and skills. Some government opted to build facilities exclusively for training athletes for international sports goals, instead of building establishments for everyone to have the liberty of using the sports facilities. From my perspective, this phenomena is a negative development.Being able to discover an individual's potential, they need to have a support from any form of sources. Establishing sports facilities can help people to discover their own interests, talents and even skills in learning new things. Centers which offer utilities, equipments and state-of-the-art tools that provide learning sports can be a great advantage to people who want to train themselves on the things that can awaken their interests when it comes to sports.In addition, building these kind of establishments, not only for the purpose to train top athletes, but also for people to immerse themselves to different variaties of activities can help them socialize more with their peers. This is extremely beneficial that aside from doing sports that they are into, they get to play along with peers, discover one's potential and also learning from one another. Furthermore, these individuals can also have the future to be one of top athletes that a country can have.In conclusion, although there are countries that chose to have their sports establishments exclusively for training top athletes, I assert that these that actions can be lead to negative feedbacks. Government should allow everyone the privilege to use and avail facilities that can hone an individual's talents, skills and dexterity when it comes to sports and this can also be immensely benefical for both country and citizen alike.;The trend of countries prioritizing specialized facilities for elite athletes over public sports infrastructure has sparked debate. On one hand, the benefits of this approach are evident. By investing in state-of-the-art facilities, top athletes can receive world-class training, which can lead to improved performances and increased medal counts in international competitions. This, in turn, can boost national pride and attract foreign investment. For instance, countries like the United States and China have made significant strides in producing world-class athletes by providing them with cutting-edge facilities and training programs.On the other hand, this approach has its drawbacks. By focusing on elite athletes, the general population may be neglected, and community sports facilities may be overlooked. This can lead to a decline in public health and fitness levels, as people are denied access to basic sports infrastructure. Furthermore, this strategy can create a culture of elitism, where only a select few have access to quality sports facilities, while the majority are left behind. This can exacerbate social inequalities and limit opportunities for talented young athletes from disadvantaged backgrounds.In my opinion, this development is negative. While it is understandable that countries want to produce top athletes, I believe that prioritizing public sports facilities is more beneficial in the long run. By providing accessible and affordable sports infrastructure, countries can promote a culture of physical activity and health among their citizens. This can have numerous benefits, including reduced healthcare costs, improved mental well-being, and a more productive workforce. Therefore, I think that countries should strike a balance between supporting elite athletes and providing sports facilities for the general public. By doing so, they can create a more inclusive and sustainable sports ecosystem that benefits everyone.
725;Some educationalists say that every child should be taught how to play a musical instrument. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;It is commonly known that music has always played an important role in upbringing of children and a lot of parents wish their kids play a musical instrument. However, I disagree that this skill is essential to every pupil.First of all, not all people are born with a talent for music, which is essential if one wants to learn how to play it. Some people are natural musicians and succeed in this sphere with ease. On the other hand, there are children for whom learning to play is a hard work and, eventually, they might start hating music instead of enjoying it. Some people are bound to become excellent engineers or doctors and for them learning to read and play music is just a waste of time.Another important factor is that all kids are different and for that reason each of them desires to have a different hobby. If all pupils spent time on music, those who are not interested in it would have less time on things that are really exciting for them. Undoubtedly, everybody has a right to spend their free time in the way they want.What is more, playing a musical instrument is not considered to be an essential skill for a successful career. More time should be devoted to more important subjects, such as Math, Science and Languages. These have more chance to be useful for people when they grow up and graduate from school.To sum up, teaching all children to play an instrument wouldn't be a good idea. It should be taught only to those who really want it as not only would it ditract a child from subjects and hobbies which are more important in their opinion, but also it cannot be mastered by everybody.;The notion that every child should be taught how to play a musical instrument has sparked a heated debate among educationalists. While some argue that it is essential for a child's development, I partially agree with this statement.On the one hand, learning to play a musical instrument can have numerous benefits for children. It can enhance their cognitive skills, such as memory and spatial reasoning, as well as promote discipline, creativity, and self-expression. Playing a musical instrument can also foster a sense of accomplishment and boost a child's confidence, which can have a positive impact on their overall academic performance. Moreover, research has shown that musical training can even improve language skills and mathematical abilities.On the other hand, making musical instrument lessons compulsory for every child may not be practical or effective. Some children may not have the interest or aptitude for playing a musical instrument, and forcing them to do so could lead to frustration and a negative attitude towards music. Additionally, the cost of providing musical instrument lessons for every child could be prohibitively expensive for many schools, particularly those in underprivileged areas. Furthermore, there are other essential subjects that may require more attention and resources, such as reading, writing, and mathematics.In conclusion, while I believe that learning to play a musical instrument can be highly beneficial for children, I do not think it should be made compulsory for every child. Instead, schools could offer musical instrument lessons as an optional extracurricular activity, allowing children who are interested to participate and benefit from the experience. Ultimately, a balanced approach that takes into account the individual interests and needs of each child is likely to be the most effective way to promote music education.
73;Some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The thought of some experts, is that people from rich countries are not satisfied by an ipotetical increase in their economy. In this essay I will discuss this point of view and I will explain why I am not sure I agree with that.It is generally believed by some professional figures, that additionals rise in economic wealth are not so crucial for a rich coutry. People from countries sush as Japan, the U.S.A, Switzerland or Cina are aware of their wide economic power and these governments offer a lot of benefits for their citizens. Thus, people have yet what they want, such as fundings for projects, well-organized cities, a lot of job opportunities. In fact, they do not fell a significant sense of satisfaction in the increase of their economy.Made this point, it is also true that some surveys used by The Italian University of Parma, reveal that citizens from coutries which a strong economy, are really grateful and satisfied by any additional rise, in the economic sector. As consequence due to this increase, they can ask more fundings for some start up or to improve the technology equipment in schools. Personally, I tend to think as a matter of fact that this is the right view. Because it is logical that more money mean more opportunities in any sector of the country. Hospitals, schools, museum and even historical buildings can have the possibility to obteind a lot of benefits.To conclude, in this essay I discuss the generel view of some experts about people from rich countries. I also explained why I strongly disagree with them.;The relationship between economic wealth and citizen satisfaction has been a topic of debate among experts. Some argue that once a country reaches a certain level of richness, further economic growth does not necessarily translate to greater satisfaction among its citizens. I agree with this statement to a certain extent.On one hand, it is true that a country's economic wealth can have a limited impact on citizen satisfaction beyond a certain point. Once basic needs such as food, shelter, and healthcare are met, additional wealth may not significantly contribute to happiness. For instance, a study found that in countries with high GDP per capita, further increases in wealth did not lead to proportional increases in citizen satisfaction. This suggests that there are diminishing returns to economic growth in terms of happiness.On the other hand, I disagree that additional economic wealth has no impact on citizen satisfaction. Wealth can still provide opportunities for personal growth, education, and leisure activities, which can contribute to overall satisfaction. Moreover, economic growth can also lead to investments in public services and infrastructure, improving the quality of life for citizens. For example, a wealthy country can invest in renewable energy, reducing pollution and improving public health, which can lead to increased satisfaction among its citizens.In conclusion, while I agree that there may be limits to the impact of economic wealth on citizen satisfaction, I do not believe that additional wealth has no effect. Economic growth can still provide opportunities and improvements in public services, leading to increased satisfaction among citizens. Ultimately, the relationship between economic wealth and citizen satisfaction is complex and influenced by various factors, and a nuanced approach is needed to understand this relationship.
1061;Some museums and art galleries charge admission fees, while others have free entry.Do you think the advantages of charging for admission outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many artistic places prefer to have an entry fee, whereas others let free access. I fully think that the benefits to have admission fees compensate the drawbacks to be not free.Many individuals would visit museum or art galleries if it were free which could attract more tourists. Unfortunately, admission charge decreases the possibility to discover paintings or masterpieces. However, before being a cultural place, art galleries are a place where numerous employees work. Indeed, if visitors had not to purchase the entrance, workforce would be not paid and the place would be not clean as museum should be. Moreover, huge museums as the British Museum have some sponsors to restore masterpieces whereas small museums have sometimes not the fundings and hence, admission fees would help it. Then, having an entry fee limit the number of individuals who do not really want to see art and appreciate the place.Concerning to cultural places, museum and art galleries know that many households could not afford ticket entrances for their offspring so many museums establish reduced price for teenagers and children. This project improves the relation between young people and the culture, then it allows children to be attracted to culture, partipate to the technical expenses behind the entry fee and after to visit again some cultural places when they will grow up and purchase the full price. Moreover, purchasing tickets help to the economy of the country which sometimes famous cultural places are a significant part of country's income. For instance, admission fees in museum are two third of the tourism's outcome in France.To conclude, I believe that admission fees should outweigh free entrance because it does not let the worth process of museum to work. Even if sometimes admission fees are costly for us, there is always a meaning behind the prices.;The debate about whether museums and art galleries should charge admission fees has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that charging for admission is necessary, others believe that it hinders the public's access to art and culture. In my opinion, the disadvantages of charging for admission outweigh the advantages.On the one hand, charging for admission can provide a significant source of revenue for museums and art galleries, which can be used to maintain and improve their facilities and collections. For instance, the Louvre in Paris charges a hefty admission fee, which enables it to preserve its vast collection of artworks, including the Mona Lisa. Moreover, charging for admission can also help to control the number of visitors, preventing overcrowding and ensuring a more pleasant experience for those who do visit.On the other hand, I believe that the disadvantages of charging for admission are more significant. For one, charging for admission can limit access to art and culture for those who cannot afford it, particularly low-income families and individuals. This can exacerbate social and economic inequalities, as those who are already disadvantaged are denied the opportunity to engage with and learn from cultural institutions. Furthermore, free admission can actually increase visitor numbers and boost local economies, as people are more likely to visit and spend money in surrounding areas. The National Museum of Scotland, for example, offers free admission and has seen a significant increase in visitor numbers since introducing this policy.In conclusion, while charging for admission can provide some benefits, I firmly believe that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. By offering free admission, museums and art galleries can promote social equality, increase visitor numbers, and contribute to the local economy. Ultimately, access to art and culture should be a fundamental right, not a privilege reserved for those who can afford it.
1355;Some parents encourage young people to leave home while others think they should stay with the family, discuss and give your opinion;Many parents encourage young people to leave home when they become older, while others think they should stay at home with the family. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.With the tremendous influence of modernisation, remarkable changes have taken place in the family structure to such an extent that nowadays, youngsters are motivated by their parents to live alone as they grow up. However, some people are of the view that it is more practical for a youngster to live with their family.On the one hand, there are many positive aspects to youths living away from their parents at young age. This provides the opportunity to young people to live a life on their own terms and make any decisions without the interference of their parents. Besides, living alone not only makes them independent but also makes them self-reliant, which is a crucial life skill to their successful career. For instance, managing all the house chores such as cleaning, paying bills, cooking and so on will make them well experienced at learning and managing diverse activities and will also boost their confidence.On the other hand, there is no denying the fact that youngsters living away from their family may find themselves in circumstances that may adversely affect their life. Naïve and inexperienced young people in the absence of parental supervision are more likely to fall prey to bad influence and dangerous activities, such as drugs or alcohol consumption, which may jeopardise their career or lead them astray from moral values. However, this situation is less likely to take place with youngsters still living with their parents. Besides, emotional bonding and family relationships can be maintained better if everyone is living together under one roof.In my opinion, although encouraging youngsters to live alone may lead them to learn various life skills, negative aspects and risks associated with living alone can far outweigh the benefits.This response covers the task topic well, by discussing the positive and negative aspects of living alone as a young adult, and the writer’s opinion has also been included. Paragraphing helps to present ideas in an orderly way, and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay. There is some repetitive use of the word ‘make’ in the first body paragraph, which could have been avoided. Apart from that, the writer’s vocabulary seems to be quite rich and allows them to communicate ideas precisely and clearly. Overall, this essay seems to be worthy of IELTS Band 8.;The decision of when young people should leave their family home is a topic of debate among parents. While some parents encourage their children to leave home at a young age, others believe that they should stay with the family for as long as possible. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and provide my opinion on the matter.On the one hand, some parents think that leaving home at a young age is beneficial for their children. It allows them to develop independence, self-reliance, and responsibility. By living on their own, young people can learn to manage their finances, cook, and clean, which are essential life skills. Additionally, leaving home can provide young people with the opportunity to explore their own interests and pursue their own goals without the influence of their parents.On the other hand, some parents believe that their children should stay with the family for as long as possible. They argue that family support and guidance are essential for young people's emotional and psychological development. Staying with the family can also provide young people with a sense of security and stability, which is particularly important during times of economic uncertainty. Furthermore, parents can continue to offer their children advice and guidance, helping them to make informed decisions about their future.In my opinion, I think that the decision of when to leave home should be based on the individual's circumstances and readiness for independence. While some young people may be ready to leave home at a young age, others may need more time to develop the necessary life skills. Ultimately, parents should have an open and honest discussion with their children to determine what is best for them. By doing so, young people can make a smooth transition to independence and achieve their full potential.
1335;Some people believe that excessive use of modern technologies, such as computers and smartphones, is negatively affecting the reading and writing skills of our young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Parents and teachers in many countries are feeling increasingly concerned about the effect of digital devices on vital skills of school-aged children. They are alarmed by the declining ability of young people to read and write and its suspected link to the influence of modern technology, and I wholeheartedly share their view. This essay will outline the reasons to watch out for the consequences of widespread use of computers and mobile phones by our youngsters.Primary school is a very important period when children develop their fine motor skills, which are involved in learning to write. Time spent typing on a mobile phone or a tablet doesn’t contribute to the necessary workout of the small muscles in the hands and fingers of young people. Not only do they get less practice in writing but also fewer opportunities to train in spelling words, since the ‘autocorrect’ and ‘autocomplete’ features use the first few letters to guess the entire word, therefore making it unnecessary for the child to remember and type it correctly. Another companion of unrestrained use of mobile devices is the jargon that is often used in text messages, where words are shortened or distorted. Exposure to ‘texting’ tends to replace the correct words with abbreviations in young minds, causing their spelling accuracy to decline.Reading is another casualty of unrestricted access to smart devices. Video content can be more appealing and immersive for kids and they often are automatically drawn to it instead of books. Reading requires regular practice and needs to become a habit in order to fully develop as a skill; however, it is being perceived as a boring and labourious activity by many youngsters compared to effortless video-watching. Easy and instant access to videos and movies pushes books further down the list of preferences of young audience, and it takes a significant commitment from parents and teachers to ensure that children continue to read books.To sum up, modern technology can be a friend or a foe for young children, depending on the choices adults in their lives make, regulating the amount of screen time and its purpose. Without due care the writing and reading abilities of kids can be harmed by other, more enjoyable activities they can use the devices for.";The widespread adoption of modern technologies, such as computers and smartphones, has sparked a heated debate about their impact on the reading and writing skills of young people. While some argue that these technologies have a detrimental effect, I partially agree with this notion.On the one hand, excessive use of modern technologies can indeed hinder the development of reading and writing skills. The constant stream of information on social media and the internet can lead to a decline in attention span and a lack of depth in reading and writing. Furthermore, the autocorrect and spell-check features on digital devices can make young people reliant on technology to correct their mistakes, rather than developing their own proofreading skills. This can result in a decline in the quality of their writing.On the other hand, modern technologies also offer numerous opportunities for young people to improve their reading and writing skills. For instance, e-books and online resources provide access to a vast array of literary works and educational materials, making it easier for young people to develop a love for reading. Additionally, online writing communities and blogs can encourage young people to write and share their thoughts and ideas with others, thus fostering their writing skills.In conclusion, while I agree that excessive use of modern technologies can have a negative impact on the reading and writing skills of young people, I also believe that these technologies have the potential to enhance and support literacy skills when used responsibly. It is essential for parents, educators, and policymakers to promote a balanced and effective use of technology to ensure that young people can reap its benefits while developing strong reading and writing skills.
877;Some people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime. Others believe that there are better ways to reduce crime. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;The increasing number of criminals are appeared in a society where some people advocate the longer incarceration resulting in a reduction of crime. However, some are divided and think that a number of better ways can help lessen the cases of crime. Which strategy should be taken to tackle this problem? This essay attempts to explore the view of both sides.An increase in the rate of crimes is a raising concerns in the community. A longer prison sentence seems to be the straightforward method to impede the crimes caused. In fact, a continuous incarceration is no room for offenders to commit the crimes in the community. This seemingly becomes an immediate achievement in the short term period. Some people deeply believe the mindset of criminals can be eliminated by the deterrence effect of the longer sentences which deprive of a person's freedom in life. In addition, it is generally recognized that the offenders have to be punished in effect of their guilty acts. The outlaws deserve a lengthening prison term in which they repent their offenses resulting in a decline in the number of crimes.Indeed, the incarceration can limit the offender's actions in a place at some points. However, it is not difficult to find there is a higher rate of reoffending upon release from prison across the countries. In 2013, the U.S.A. had a reoffending rate of 52% which prisoners reoffended within a year of release with a record of 49.2% in the U.K. The proportion of reoffenders occupied nearly a half of criminals. It reveals that the prison sentences is not a effective way to decrease the number of criminal cases. This implies that a decline in the crimes can be achieved araising from a decline in the likelihood of reoffending. Rehabilitation during the course of their sentence can be adopted to tackle this problems. These include direct therapeutic interventions to address the psychological causes of criminal behaviours as well as services to prepare offenderes to successfully reintegrate into the community after release. Those actions include the provision of academic programmes, vocational courses and employment opportunities.My take on this is that the incarceration alone is rarely considered enough in the control of criminal cases. A longer prison term only increase the financial cost from the government, but it cannot lower the likelihood of criminal offenses. The governments have to address the root factors causing offenses is the prime issue to reduce the crimes.;The debate on how to reduce crime has sparked a longstanding discussion, with some advocating for longer prison sentences and others proposing alternative methods. On the one hand, those who support longer prison sentences argue that this approach serves as a deterrent, preventing individuals from committing crimes in the first place. The rationale behind this view is that the fear of spending a significant amount of time behind bars will discourage potential offenders. Furthermore, this approach also ensures that criminals are removed from society, thereby reducing the likelihood of them committing further crimes.On the other hand, there are those who believe that longer prison sentences are not the most effective way to reduce crime. They argue that the root causes of crime, such as poverty, lack of education, and unemployment, need to be addressed in order to prevent individuals from turning to crime in the first place. Instead of focusing solely on punishment, they propose that resources should be allocated towards rehabilitation programs, community development, and social support systems. This approach aims to tackle the underlying issues that lead to criminal behavior, thereby reducing the likelihood of recidivism and promoting a safer society.In my opinion, while longer prison sentences may provide a temporary solution, they do not address the underlying causes of crime. Therefore, I believe that a more holistic approach, which incorporates rehabilitation, education, and community development, is more likely to yield long-term results. By investing in people and communities, we can work towards creating a society where crime is less likely to occur, and where those who do commit crimes are given the opportunity to reform and reintegrate into society. Ultimately, a combination of both punishment and rehabilitation is necessary to effectively reduce crime.
379;Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;This essay agrees on the need of that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities, but always under one premise: those students should have demonstrated their capability to comply with university studies successfully.There are countries, for example Scandinavian countries, where their government helps students by giving them specific students' loans. These loans have special characteristics such as long loan terms and low interest rates. It is not for free, but at least a higher number of students can have access to upgrade their studies.And in many other European countries university fees are not large, so most of the students can access to bachelor studies. What it's not easy is having the needed qualification you need to access to the specific university study you want.If we talk in worlwide terms, university studies are limited to wealthy people.In fact I read only a couple of weeks ago that only a 17% of worlds' population have university studies. There is a contradiction between developped and non developped countries. As an example, in most countries in Europe we have too many university students. Actually they cannot find a job easily at their own country and sometimes they emigrate to another country in Europe or outside Europe. Furthermore vocational workers such as plumbers, waiters or receptionists can't be found, there no unemployment in vocational work!.The opposite happens in non developped countries. As university studies have large fees, almost nobody can access to them, and vocational workers suffer unemployment, so they need to emigrate to other countries to find jobs.To summarize, I believe fees should not be an obstacle to study in a university. The obstable should be your previous califications.Education and Health, as much as a country can hold them, should be available for all population, poor and wealthy, with non differentiation.;The issue of whether governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities has sparked a heated debate. While some people argue that governments should bear the cost of university education, I partially disagree with this statement.On the one hand, paying full course fees for university students can have numerous benefits. It can increase accessibility to higher education, allowing students from low-income backgrounds to pursue their academic goals without being burdened by financial constraints. This, in turn, can lead to a more educated and skilled workforce, which can have positive effects on the economy. Furthermore, free university education can also promote social mobility and reduce income inequality.On the other hand, paying full course fees for all university students can be a significant financial burden on governments. The cost of providing free university education can be substantial, and governments may need to divert funds from other important public services such as healthcare and infrastructure. Additionally, some students may not make the most of free university education, which can lead to a waste of resources.Instead of paying full course fees for all students, governments could consider providing financial assistance to students who are in need, such as through scholarships or loans. This way, governments can still support students who are unable to afford university education while also ensuring that resources are being used efficiently. In conclusion, while I understand the benefits of free university education, I believe that governments should prioritize providing financial assistance to students who need it most, rather than paying full course fees for all students.
1428;Some people believe that having a pet such as a cat or a dog helps old people to live a more enjoyable life and to stay healthier. How do you think old people benefit from having a pet? Do you think there are any problems related to old people who have pets?;, and indeed, the importance of relationship between human beings and their pets has been proved to be slightly exaggerated in some nations. However, although problems regarding may affect the health conditions of old people, the benefits that these lovely animals bring to them, physically and mentally alike, are clearly undeniable.In of physical benefits, the well-being of elderly people with pets compared to those without pets, since not only do they have to take care of themselves, the responsibility ensure their one fed and well looked after encourages them to become even more active. Due to these extra activities, this might not have an obvious influence on their health, but at least this could help them to avoid bad . Coupled with physical side, their mental wellbeing will also be improved, and the reason is that having someone to take care of would reduce the chance of feeling . Therefore, their could be minimised.In spite of the above advantages, the interaction between pets and vulnerable old people still exist. One of the major concerns is the of these animal on their tracheas, especially those asthma. virtually invisible in the air, many asthma symptoms are caused unconsciously by pets. In addition to the fact that old people might experience difficulty in looking after their pets, as their health conditions are limited, could become even more when they try take care of others.In conclusion, it is true that obstacles still exist for elderly people in adopting pets, but the benefits of this topic its . For such reasons, instead of , further support would be far more beneficial.;As people age, they often experience social isolation, loneliness, and decreased physical activity, which can negatively impact their mental and physical health. However, one way to mitigate these issues is by having a pet, such as a cat or dog. I firmly believe that having a pet can greatly benefit older adults, enabling them to live a more enjoyable and healthier life.The benefits of pet ownership for older adults are numerous. For one, pets provide companionship and social interaction, which can help alleviate feelings of loneliness and isolation. Pets also encourage physical activity, such as walking or playing with the pet, which can help maintain mobility and flexibility. Additionally, pets can offer a sense of purpose and responsibility, which can boost self-esteem and overall well-being. Studies have shown that older adults with pets tend to have lower blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and body mass index compared to those without pets.However, there are also potential problems related to older adults having pets. For example, caring for a pet can be physically demanding, particularly for those with mobility or health issues. Additionally, the cost of pet care, including food, veterinary bills, and supplies, can be a significant financial burden for older adults on a fixed income. Moreover, if the pet requires frequent veterinary visits or has behavioral issues, it can be stressful and overwhelming for the owner.In conclusion, while there may be some challenges associated with older adults having pets, the benefits of companionship, physical activity, and a sense of purpose far outweigh the drawbacks. With some planning and support, older adults can enjoy the many rewards of pet ownership, leading to a more enjoyable and healthier life.
1300;Some people believe that homework should not be given to school children. Others, however, say that homework is an important requirement for children to be able to develop appropriately. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The benefits of giving or not giving homework to children are often debated. Some people feel that children have enough work to do during one day whilst at school, whereas others feel that the more work set, the better.It is true that schools today place more and more demands and pressure on children. The competition to do well, to enter a good university and to get a good job is significant. This has led to the ideology that children should do as much schoolwork as possible in order to help their intellectual development. The argument, however, that more is better is not always valid. There comes a point, especially for a child, when more knowledge cannot be absorbed in a day. When a child has possibly 7 or 8 classes a day on different subjects, he or she is processing a lot of information already. To give more work to be done at home, therefore, would be pointless and even counterproductive. In addition to this, although it is important to be educated, childhood should also be a time when there is an opportunity to just play and enjoy unstructured time. Homework can significantly lessen the possibilities of doing this.On the other hand, it can be argued that there is a place for homework. If study at school is not overdone, the opportunity to look at work again and extend ideas can be an invaluable exercise. It’s easy to forget one thing that has been taught once, but if that concept is revisited a second time, the brain has time to reprocess and likely better understand and remember.It seems to me that there is a place for homework for today’s children. What must be remembered, though, is that homework needs to be limited to age-appropriate parameters, so that a balance can be struck between study and free time and relaxation.;The debate about whether homework should be given to school children has been ongoing for years. While some people argue that homework is unnecessary and can be detrimental to a child's development, others believe that it is essential for their academic growth. In this essay, I will discuss both views and provide my own opinion.On the one hand, those who oppose homework argue that it can be a significant source of stress and anxiety for children. They claim that the long hours spent on homework can take away from the time children have to play, relax, and engage in extracurricular activities, which are essential for their physical and mental well-being. Furthermore, they argue that homework can be a hindrance to children's creativity and imagination, as it can make them feel pressured to complete tasks rather than explore and learn at their own pace.On the other hand, proponents of homework argue that it is a vital tool for reinforcing learning and helping children develop important skills such as time management, self-discipline, and critical thinking. Homework, they claim, helps children to review and practice what they have learned in class, which can improve their understanding and retention of the material. Additionally, homework can help children develop a sense of responsibility and accountability, as they learn to prioritize tasks and manage their time effectively.In my opinion, homework can be beneficial for children's development, but it should be given in moderation. Excessive homework can indeed be counterproductive, while a moderate amount can help children reinforce their learning and develop important skills. For example, a study in Finland showed that students who were given a moderate amount of homework performed better in exams and had better time management skills than those who were given excessive homework. Therefore, I believe that homework should be given, but with careful consideration of the amount and type of homework, to ensure that it is beneficial and not detrimental to children's development.
1369;Some people believe that preserving natural environment is crucial, but make no effort to do so (reasons and solutions);Some people believe that preserving natural environment is crucial, however, most make no effort to do so. Why do you think this is happening? What are some simple actions that could help the environment?It is commonly believed that preservation of natural resources is imperative, yet most people seem to exert no effort in doing so. Understanding the causes of this negligent attitude may help with devising some simple measures to safeguard the deteriorating environment.Lack of awareness is probably the foremost reason why the vast majority of individuals appears to be unmindful of the current environmental issues. Normally, people have tendency to downplay abstract problems, or those to happen in the distant future. This is because they are not properly informed of the possible detrimental effects of taking the environment for granted. To illustrate, residents in urban areas often deliberately dump their into the nearby creeks and drainage canals causing them to become clogged. It is only when devastating floods strike, that they come to realize the consequences of their actions.Some basic solutions that could be carried out are extensive awareness through all forms of communication and strict implementation of waste management. In addition to the traditional press, social media is a powerful means of disseminating information regarding the impending disasters and their potential hazards. This is a good way of persuading the public to actively take part in the campaign. Another straightforward solution, and by far the least anyone can do to help save the nature is disposing of garbage thoughtfully. Apart from avoiding throwing trash anywhere, everyone should practice proper segregation of biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and recyclable wastes at all times. These actions, when coordinated by the local governments, can be tremendously successful.In conclusion, while individual awareness is key to maintaining a healthy ecosystem, concerted efforts of governments and are much more effective in achieving such goal.The response is well written, it contains reasons, solutions and fully addresses the task. The ideas aren’t repeated, they are conveyed in a clear and easy to understand manner and organised well with sufficient use of cohesive devices. The vocabulary is varied, sentence structures are complex and instances of incorrect grammar are hardly noticeable. Overall, this essay is likely to achieve Band 8 in IELTS.;The preservation of the natural environment is a crucial aspect of maintaining a healthy and sustainable planet. However, it has been observed that many individuals who acknowledge the importance of environmental conservation often fail to take concrete actions towards it. This disparity between awareness and action can be attributed to several reasons.One of the primary reasons is the lack of awareness about the simple, everyday actions that can contribute to environmental preservation. Many people believe that making a difference requires grand,se gestures, which can be overwhelming and discouraging. Additionally, the convenience and affordability of single-use plastics and other environmentally harmful products can make it difficult for individuals to opt for eco-friendly alternatives.Another significant factor is the perceived trade-off between economic growth and environmental protection. Some individuals may believe that prioritizing the environment would compromise their economic well-being or the progress of their community. Furthermore, societal norms and cultural values can also influence an individual's willingness to adopt environmentally friendly habits.To bridge this gap between awareness and action, several solutions can be implemented. Firstly, education and awareness campaigns can be designed to inform people about the simple, yet impactful, changes they can make in their daily lives, such as reducing plastic use, conserving water, and using public transport. Governments and corporations can also play a crucial role by implementing policies and practices that promote sustainability and provide affordable, eco-friendly alternatives. Moreover, community-based initiatives that encourage collective action towards environmental preservation can foster a sense of responsibility and motivation among individuals. By addressing the root causes of inaction and implementing these solutions, we can empower individuals to make a positive impact on the environment and work towards a more sustainable future.
1322;Some people believe that the best way to solve environmental problems is to increase the price of fuel.Do you agree or disagree?;"Raising the price of car fuel is believed by some people to be an excellent method to solve the growing number of environmental issues. However, I strongly disagree with this idea, as doing so would make life difficult for lower-income households. While making fuel more expensive wouldn’t change the habits of wealthy families, switching to fossil fuel alternatives could prove to be much more beneficial for the environment.The most compelling reason against raising the cost of fuel is that the upper classes of society will hardly be affected by rising fuel costs, as this only makes up a minor proportion of their expenditure. They will continue to use their personal vehicles as they wish without a thought for the environment or the higher fuel prices, even if their country has state-of-the-art public transportation.Those who will feel the crunch of this decision are the middle-class and lower-income households, since travelling is a major part of most people’s routine, be it to work, school or shopping. Driving is almost unavoidable in many instances; therefore, raising the price of petrol would only serve to widen the gap between the rich and poor, and serve as an inadvertent form of discrimination.Another reason why increasing the cost of fuel is far from the best way to deal with environmental pollution is that now there are much more viable alternatives. Due to the rapid advances in technology, scientists and engineers have been able to develop several alternatives to fossil fuel, such as cars powered by electricity or naturally produced biofuel. The move to adopt clean energy sources instead of fossil fuels is a much more promising alternative compared to simply making fuel more expensive.In conclusion, I believe that governments of the world should invest more time and money in finding alternatives to fossil fuels that are more environmentally friendly, rather than simply raising the cost of petrol.";The issue of environmental problems has become a pressing concern globally, and various solutions have been proposed to address it. One such solution is to increase the price of fuel, which some people believe is the most effective way to mitigate environmental issues. In this essay, I will argue that I agree with this proposition.Increasing the price of fuel would lead to a reduction in its consumption, as people would be less likely to use fuel-guzzling vehicles and machines. This, in turn, would result in a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, which are a major contributor to climate change and air pollution. Moreover, higher fuel prices would incentivize individuals and businesses to invest in alternative energy sources, such as solar and wind power, which are cleaner and more sustainable.Additionally, the revenue generated from increased fuel prices could be used to fund environmental initiatives, such as reforestation programs, pollution cleanup efforts, and the development of green technologies. This would not only help to reduce the environmental damage caused by fuel consumption but also promote sustainable development.However, it is also important to consider the potential impact of higher fuel prices on low-income households and small businesses, which may struggle to adapt to the increased costs. To mitigate this, governments could introduce measures such as subsidies or tax breaks to support these groups.In conclusion, increasing the price of fuel is a viable solution to environmental problems, as it would reduce fuel consumption, promote the use of alternative energy sources, and generate revenue for environmental initiatives. While there may be some drawbacks, these can be addressed through careful policy design and implementation. Overall, I firmly believe that higher fuel prices can play a crucial role in protecting our environment for future generations.
1273;Some people believe that we cannot learn anything from the past for our life today, while others believe that history is a valuable source of information to understand human's life.Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is true that these days people say there is little we can gain from previous history, whereas others think that history is a key source to understand our lives. Although there are some strong arguments against learning history, I agree with learning history to know life of human.There are two reasons why people think there is nothing to gain from history. Firstly, there is evidence to support the idea that learning history stresses people out. Based on a survey conducted by Standford University, 57 percent of people consider learning past life of humans a primary source of stress, while less than 6 percent of people said studying previous humans' life was not a stressor. Secondly, people may not have time to remember historical events because the constant stimulation and hustle and bustle of society is holding them back from their life. In turn, they are more likely to regard learning history as useless.Despite the negative drawbacks, I support that historical event is great information to comprehend human's life. The main benefit of a historical event is that it can have a positive impact on people, especially children, as they grow up. Since history has more connection and support to our lives, it allows children to become more insightful and knowledgeable and discover advanced perspectives. For example, I have been widening my perspective through historical events in my family or country because gaining history regarding my family and nation taught me the right attitude to understand today. However, if I did not know any history, I would not have had an opportunity to understand human life and self-development. So, learning history should be encouraged.In conclusion, while I recognize the possible disadvantages of learning history, I believe that the benefits of gaining past events far outweigh them in the long term.;The debate about whether we can learn from the past has sparked intense discussion among individuals. On one hand, some people argue that history has little relevance to our lives today, and that we cannot learn anything valuable from past events. They believe that the world is constantly changing, and that the circumstances of the past are too different from those of the present to provide any useful insights.On the other hand, others firmly believe that history is a treasure trove of information, offering valuable lessons that can help us navigate the complexities of human life. According to this perspective, studying the past allows us to understand the roots of current problems, identify patterns and trends, and gain a deeper appreciation for the achievements and mistakes of our predecessors. For instance, the rise and fall of empires, the consequences of wars, and the impact of social movements can provide invaluable lessons on governance, diplomacy, and social justice.In my opinion, I strongly agree with the latter view. History is replete with examples of successes and failures that can inform our decisions and actions in the present. By studying the past, we can learn from the experiences of others, avoiding the mistakes of previous generations and building upon their achievements. For example, the story of the Great Depression can teach us about the importance of prudent economic management, while the Civil Rights Movement can inspire us to strive for equality and justice. In conclusion, history is a rich source of knowledge that can enrich our understanding of human life, and I firmly believe that we can learn valuable lessons from the past to improve our lives today.
1342;Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military, while others disagree (opinion);Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military. Others think that women are less suitable for this kind of job. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Sample EssayIn recent years gender equality in employment has been the topic of heated debate. While some may argue that women are less suited for certain jobs such as with the police or the military, I believe that female candidates should be treated the same as their male counterparts.Those who consider women to be unsuited for some kinds of jobs including the police or the military often hold that opinion because such jobs are extremely physically demanding. As the female body has smaller muscles and less physical strength compared to male body, women may have difficulty engaging in strenuous activity which can be exhausting even for men. In military service, female soldiers are more likely to struggle while defending themselves than their male peers when they are forced to move around carrying heavy firearms in the battle, which can increase their risk of mission failure. Because of the hazards and extreme conditions they may encounter, some people advocate that women are not suitable for work in these fields.Nevertheless, I believe that female applicants should be considered for police or military placements without a gender bias, because women are more suited to certain tasks. In the police service, female officers can perform important roles on some occasions such as a body search where male officers are restricted from touching female convicts. In the military service, female nursing staff are more likely to care better for injured soldiers since maternal instinct makes them dedicated and heart-warming professionals. Furthermore, for the sake of fairness to all, job seekers should have an equal opportunity to choose their jobs freely, regardless of gender. Many women have the desire to work in the police and the military and some of them have relevant expertise and qualifications. Therefore, they should not be discriminated against in employment opportunities for these jobs.In conclusion, although some say that women are incompatible with police and military duties because of the high physical demands, I believe that they should be treated as equal to men. This is because there are certain roles with the police and the military that are more suitable for women than men, and therefore both genders should have equal employment opportunities.;The debate surrounding the equal treatment of women in the police and military forces has been a contentious issue for years. On one hand, there are those who firmly believe that women should be treated as equals to men when applying for jobs in these fields. They argue that women possess the same capabilities and strengths as men, and therefore, should be given the same opportunities. This perspective is grounded in the principle of gender equality, which emphasizes that women should have the same rights and opportunities as men in all aspects of life, including employment.On the other hand, there are those who disagree with this opinion. They argue that certain jobs in the police and military require physical strength and endurance that may not be suitable for women. They also express concerns about the safety and well-being of female officers in high-risk situations. However, this argument is often based on outdated stereotypes about women's abilities and ignores the fact that many women have proven themselves to be highly capable and brave in these roles.In reality, women have made significant contributions to the police and military, and their participation has enhanced the effectiveness and diversity of these institutions. By treating women as equals, these organizations can tap into a wider pool of talent and skills, which can lead to better outcomes and more nuanced decision-making. Moreover, equal treatment of women in the police and military is not only a matter of fairness but also a way to promote gender equality in society at large.In conclusion, the notion that women should be treated as equals to men when applying for jobs in the police or military is grounded in the principles of fairness, equality, and the recognition of women's capabilities. It is essential to challenge stereotypes and prejudices that hinder women's participation in these fields and to create an environment where women can serve with dignity and respect. By doing so, we can strengthen these institutions and promote a more equitable society.
1376;Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research (discuss);Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research for the benefit of human beings, while others argue that it is wrong. Discuss both views and give your opinion.People have different views on how medical research should be conducted and tested. Although many people support the use of for developing medicines, I personally believe that animal testing is morally wrong.The main reason why some people value to conduct medical research is because animal testing has contributed to many life-saving cures and treatments. It is true that nearly every medical breakthrough in the last 100 years has resulted directly from research using animals. For example, experiments in which dogs had their pancreases removed led directly to the discovery of insulin, critical to saving the lives of diabetics. Furthermore, it is impossible to release to the market before proving it no harm to humans and laboratory mice are appropriate research subjects because they are similar to human beings in many ways.However, I people who consider medical development that involved the use of animals cruel and unacceptable. I believe that the lives of all creatures should be respected and we, humans, have no right to for our own benefits. Governments should invest in developing alternative methods that can replace when doing medical research. For example, a software program can be developed to model a human immune system and new drugs can be tested on the software rather than animals. In this way, no animals will suffer from the medical tests and the society can still benefit from medical development.In conclusion, although it is undoubtedly true that animal testing has helped scientists in drug developments and medical discoveries, I believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused to animals and we should use alternative methods when doing medical research that do not involve animals suffering.This is a great essay. It addresses the two sides of the argument by exploring reasons why animals should and should not be used in medical research. The ideas are well explained and supported by examples. The use of paragraphing is efficient and helps with logical sequencing of ideas. Linking words are used appropriately to achieve the necessary cohesion. Author’s meaning is skillfully conveyed by the use of wide range of vocabulary. Even though there are some inaccurately used expressions, they don’t hinder understanding. Most sentences are error-free, instances of faulty grammar are rare. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;The use of animals in medical research has been a topic of debate for many years. Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research, arguing that it is necessary for advancing human health and medicine. They argue that animal testing has led to numerous breakthroughs in medical science, including the development of vaccines, antibiotics, and cancer treatments.On the other hand, there are those who strongly oppose the use of animals in medical research, citing ethical and moral concerns. They argue that animals are sentient beings with the capacity to feel pain, suffer, and experience stress, and that using them for research purposes is a violation of their rights. They also argue that alternative methods, such as computer simulations and in vitro testing, are available and can be just as effective.However, proponents of animal testing argue that these alternative methods are not yet sophisticated enough to fully replace animal testing. They claim that animals are necessary to test the safety and efficacy of new drugs and treatments, and that the benefits of animal testing far outweigh the costs. Additionally, many medical researchers argue that animal testing is strictly regulated and that the welfare of the animals is carefully considered.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, it is difficult to deny the significant contributions that animal testing has made to medical science. Nevertheless, it is also important to acknowledge the ethical concerns surrounding animal testing and to continue to explore alternative methods. Ultimately, a balanced approach that takes into account both the benefits and the costs of animal testing is necessary to ensure that medical research is conducted in a responsible and humane manner. By doing so, we can advance human health and medicine while also minimizing animal suffering.
1057;Some people feel that entertainers such as film stars, pop musicians or sports stars are paid too much money.Do you agree or disagree?Which other types of job should be highly paid?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Jobs such as actors, musicians or athlete earns a lot of money, however, a part of people argued that these kinds of people are overpaid. In my opinion, I disagree with this view and believes that they deserved the high salary.People who works as a movie stars, musicians and sports player deserved high money paid. This is because they advocated all there time and effort to get the salary that they have today. Before they become famous, they only have few incomes or even get nothing. That is to say, many musicians did not get any payment at the begining of their career, so do the actors and sports players, they spent their time but do not get any money. For instance, before being a well-known musicians, they have to spend their own money on buying equipment to produce musics or to public the songs they have made. Also, the creativety and their works cannot be measured by money. Thus, they deserved high salary because of their profession and uncopyable works.Jobs which needs professional skills and the job envolves high risk shoul also be highly paid. Such as doctors and programmers, their job are unplaceable because these envolved professional knowledge that not everyone had. Moreover, people works in high-risk environment deserved high payment too. For example, fire-fighters, they might got hurt or even die while working. Therefore, higher salary is needed for jobs that need special skills and career with high risk.To sum up, I agree with the statement because of the reasons above, and jobs with special knowledge and people works in dangerous environment should also be highly paid.;The notion that entertainers such as film stars, pop musicians, or sports stars are paid too much money is a widely debated topic. In my opinion, I agree that these individuals are often overcompensated for their work. The astronomical amounts they earn can be staggering, with some celebrities earning tens of millions of dollars per year. While it is true that they bring joy and entertainment to millions of people, their salaries seem disproportionate to the value they create.In contrast, there are other types of jobs that are often underpaid and underappreciated, despite their significant contributions to society. For instance, teachers, nurses, and social workers are essential to the well-being of our communities, yet they are often paid relatively low wages. These professionals dedicate their lives to educating, healing, and supporting vulnerable populations, and their work has a direct impact on the quality of life for many individuals.Furthermore, jobs that require high levels of education, skill, and risk, such as doctors, engineers, and firefighters, should also be highly paid. These professionals undergo extensive training and put their lives on the line to ensure public safety and provide critical services. For example, doctors spend years studying and training to become specialists in their fields, and their expertise is crucial in saving lives and improving healthcare outcomes.In conclusion, while entertainers do bring value to our lives, their salaries seem excessive compared to other professions that contribute significantly to the greater good. It is essential to reevaluate our priorities and recognize the worth of jobs that make a tangible difference in people's lives, such as teaching, healthcare, and public service. By doing so, we can work towards creating a more equitable and just compensation system that rewards individuals based on the true value they create.
1289;Some people feel that fashion is like art and a significant part of society, while others feel that fashion is a waste of time and money.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"The fashion industry today is an important component of society and people’s lives. It is true that many people care little for clothes and scorn the importance that others attach to them; however, this does not mean that the significance that people give to fashion is a waste of time and money.When one considers that areas of the world suffer from poverty, disease and inadequate access to food and clean water, the emphasis attached to fashion by the developed world can seem out of proportion. Many people would contend that the resources put into developing and creating fashion would be more ethically spent on creating some level of equality in terms of the right to live a healthy and happy life. This point is hard to argue with. However, it is also true that people in the developed world cannot be expected to send all their spending money to people in need and that wanting to look good is an unalterable human trait.The fashion industry contributes to the society much like most other industries. It provides jobs and income to millions of people around the world and the money that changes hands generates taxes that contribute to the fabric of society. There is more to fashion than trying to look better than others and excessive luxury. The high level of fashion is indeed a kind of art form and, like other art forms, there will always be people who appreciate it, want to create it and want to spend money on it. It is part of the development of civilisation and this is not likely to change.I therefore feel that, although the gap between the rich and the poor sometimes makes it seem that fashion is a waste of time and money and an unethical use of resources, fashion is an important part of today’s society and economic output. This leads me to believe that trying to strike a balance between selfish greed and a more altruistic way of living should be an individual choice.";"The debate about the significance of fashion in society has been ongoing, with some people viewing it as a form of art and a crucial aspect of culture, while others see it as a frivolous waste of time and money. On the one hand, those who consider fashion as an art form argue that it allows individuals to express their creativity and showcase their unique personalities. Fashion designers are akin to artists, using fabrics, colors, and textures to create masterpieces that evoke emotions and convey messages. The fashion industry also plays a substantial role in the economy, providing employment opportunities and generating significant revenue. For instance, the Met Gala, a prominent fashion event, is not only a celebration of style but also a platform for fundraising and promoting social causes.On the other hand, critics of fashion argue that it is a superficial and materialistic pursuit, encouraging people to prioritize appearance over substance. They contend that the constant need to keep up with the latest trends leads to unnecessary consumerism and waste, contributing to environmental degradation and social inequality. Moreover, the fashion industry is often criticized for its lack of diversity and inclusivity, as well as its perpetuation of unrealistic beauty standards.In my opinion, fashion is more than just a trivial aspect of society. While it is true that the industry has its flaws, I believe that fashion can be a powerful tool for self-expression, cultural exchange, and social commentary. When done responsibly, fashion can promote sustainability, diversity, and body positivity. For example, brands like Patagonia and Reformation are leading the way in eco-friendly and ethical fashion practices. Furthermore, fashion has been used as a platform to raise awareness about social issues, such as the ""Pink Ribbon"" campaign for breast cancer awareness. In conclusion, while there are valid criticisms of the fashion industry, I think that its artistic and cultural value, as well as its potential for positive change, make it a significant and worthwhile part of society."
1294;Some people feel that learning a foreign language is an essential component of a child’s education. Others feel that learning a foreign language is often a waste of time that can be better spent on learning about technology and other more vocational subjects.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Throughout the history of education, learning a foreign language or languages has been a constant component. Of course, many people feel that this is really an unnecessary part of education for everyone, but this is not a point of view that I share.The opponents to learning a foreign language might argue that most people do not travel that often outside their own country. In addition to this, out of all the countries of the world, comparatively not many share the same language. Therefore, learning a foreign language will only be useful for the very limited time that one spends in a country where this language is used. For some people, the language might never be used in their entire lives. When one thinks about how much time and money are spent training language teachers, buying resources, going on trips and delivering lessons for such a negligible benefit, this would seem to be a very inefficient allocation of resources.However, the benefits of learning a foreign language go further than just the ability to use it from time to time on a holiday or business trip. Firstly, through learning one language, one gains an understanding to some extent of how all languages work. Thus, no matter where people might end up around the world, the knowledge of language can be of use. Secondly, with the study of a foreign language, one also opens oneself up to other cultures. This allows in turn an appreciation for different points of view and belief systems. With an ever-shrinking world due to globalisation, the ability to empathise and understand the people from other countries is vital to reducing conflict and creating a more tolerant society. Finally, quite simply learning languages is excellent for the improvement of general cognitive skills.It seems to me that learning a foreign language, therefore, is more than just gaining the ability to speak a few words of a foreign tongue. It is part of intellectual and social development and needs to be continued for everyone in today’s schools.;The debate surrounding the importance of learning a foreign language in a child's education has sparked intense discussion. On one hand, some people believe that acquiring a foreign language is a crucial aspect of a child's educational journey. They argue that it not only broadens their cultural understanding but also enhances their career opportunities in an increasingly globalized world. For instance, a child who speaks multiple languages can communicate effectively with people from diverse backgrounds, fostering international relationships and collaborations. Moreover, research has shown that learning a foreign language can improve cognitive skills, as it requires the development of memory, attention, and problem-solving abilities.On the other hand, others contend that learning a foreign language is a waste of time, which could be better spent on learning about technology and other vocational subjects. They claim that in today's digital age, where translation software and artificial intelligence are readily available, the need to learn a foreign language is diminishing. Furthermore, they argue that subjects like coding, computer science, and engineering are more practical and in-demand skills that can guarantee a child's future employability.In my opinion, I strongly believe that learning a foreign language is an essential component of a child's education. While it is true that technology has made significant advancements, human interaction and cultural exchange are still invaluable assets in any profession. A foreign language is not just a means of communication but also a window into a new culture, history, and perspective. For example, a student who learns Spanish can not only communicate with Spanish speakers but also understand the rich cultural heritage of Spain and Latin America. Moreover, in a world where international collaboration and diplomacy are becoming increasingly important, the ability to communicate in multiple languages can be a valuable asset for any individual. Therefore, I think that learning a foreign language should be a priority in a child's education, as it can open doors to new experiences, cultures, and opportunities that can shape their future in meaningful ways.
1073;Some people feel that the design of newly constructed buildings in big cities should be controlled by governments. Others believe those who finance the construction of a building should be free to design it as they see fit.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is often argued that governments should involve in construction's design in huge cities, while others argued that governments do not have to retrict the free of designers' imagination if those designs are splendid fit on the cities. I believe that if that were to happen, it would be the positive development. This essay will highlight the both views and give personal opinion from the former argument's side.To begin with latter opinion, although governments have worried about the combination of buildings entirely, the strong limitation about design can cause squandering of designers' skills. There are huge number of competitions about designing building in this society, and the evolution in these fields has developed dramatically. However, if there is a strict criteria on design of building, the majority of intelligences do not need to hammer away to come up with revolutional outline for building.On the other hand, signitured design of the big cities by itself can be the purpose of trevelling as a landmark, and it can be followed by significant economical achievement in the country. To take myself as an example, in 2017, I went to Gold Coast for study automotive engineering, and I was stunnied becaused of the atmosphere which is formed by combination of similar buildings and beach. Furthermore, according to the research from Sydney university, Gold Coast is one of the cities which make a fortune because of marvelous view.To sum up with, I would therefore argue that in spite of the fact that building design restriction can influence on architects negatively, it has a potential ability to make a significant profit in the future.;The debate over who should control the design of newly constructed buildings in big cities has sparked a contentious discussion. On one hand, some people argue that governments should have a say in the design of buildings to maintain aesthetic uniformity and ensure that the structures align with the city's master plan. This approach can prevent the construction of buildings that are eyesores or disrupt the harmony of the urban landscape. For instance, the city of Paris has strict building codes to preserve its historic charm and character.On the other hand, others believe that those who finance the construction of a building should have the freedom to design it as they see fit. This perspective emphasizes the importance of creativity and innovation in architecture, allowing developers to create unique and iconic structures that reflect the city's diversity. For example, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, designed by Frank Gehry, is a testament to the power of unconstrained architectural expression, drawing millions of visitors and boosting the local economy.In my opinion, a balanced approach is necessary. While governments should establish guidelines to ensure that buildings comply with safety and environmental standards, they should also give developers sufficient freedom to express their creativity. This can be achieved through flexible zoning regulations and incentives for sustainable and innovative designs. Ultimately, a collaborative approach between governments, developers, and architects can result in the creation of beautiful, functional, and sustainable buildings that enhance the urban experience and contribute to the city's prosperity. By striking a balance between control and creativity, cities can become vibrant and dynamic hubs that showcase human ingenuity and progress.
1292;Some people feel that with the rise of artificial intelligence, computers and robots will take over the roles of teachers. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;With ever increasing technological advances, computers and robots are replacing human roles in different areas of society. This trend can also be seen in education, where interactive programs can enhance the educational experience for children and young adults. Whether, however, this revolution can also take over the role of the teacher completely is debatable, and I oppose this idea as it is unlikely to serve students well.The roles of computers and robots can be seen in many areas of the workplace. Classic examples are car factories, where a lot of the repetitive precision jobs done on assembly lines have been performed by robots for many years, and medicine, where diagnosis, and treatment, including operations, have also been assisted by computers for a long time. According to the media, it won’t also be long until we have cars that are driven automatically.It has long been discussed whether robots and computers can do this in education. It is well known that the complexity of programs can now adapt to so many situations that something can already be set up that has the required knowledge of the teacher, along with the ability to predict and answer all questions that might be asked by students. In fact, due to the nature of computers, the knowledge levels can far exceed a teacher’s and have more breadth, as a computer can have equal knowledge in all the subjects that are taught in school, as opposed to a single teacher’s specialisation. It seems very likely, therefore, that computers and robots should be able to deliver the lessons that teachers can, including various ways of differentiating and presenting materials to suit varying abilities and ages of students.Where I am not convinced is in the pastoral role of teachers. Part of teaching is managing behaviour and showing empathy with students, so that they feel cared for and important. Even if a robot or computer can be programmed to imitate these actions, students will likely respond in a different way when they know an interaction is part of an algorithm rather than based on human emotion.Therefore, although I feel that computers should be able to perform a lot of the roles of teachers in the future, they should be used as educational tools to assist teachers and not to replace them. In this way, students would receive the benefits of both ways of instruction.;The notion that computers and robots will replace teachers with the advent of artificial intelligence has sparked intense debate. While I understand the concerns, I disagree with this statement to a large extent. In my opinion, the role of a teacher extends far beyond the dissemination of information, which is the primary function that artificial intelligence can replicate.First and foremost, teaching is not just about imparting knowledge, but also about nurturing, guiding, and mentoring students. Human teachers provide emotional support, empathy, and individualized attention, which are essential for a student's holistic development. AI systems, no matter how sophisticated, lack the emotional intelligence and empathy to understand the nuances of human emotions and behavior. For instance, a teacher can recognize when a student is struggling not just with the material, but with personal issues and can offer support accordingly. This personalized approach is irreplaceable by current AI technology.Furthermore, education involves complex interactions such as discussions, debates, and project collaborations, which require human intuition, creativity, and critical thinking. While AI can process and analyze vast amounts of data, it cannot replicate the depth and richness of human interaction. The learning process is highly context-dependent, and human teachers are better equipped to adapt their teaching methods according to the needs and responses of their students.Additionally, the development of critical thinking, problem-solving, and ethical decision-making skills in students is largely facilitated by human teachers. These skills are not just about processing information, but about understanding its implications, questioning assumptions, and considering different perspectives, all of which require a level of human judgment and experience that AI systems currently cannot match.In conclusion, while artificial intelligence will undoubtedly enhance the educational process by providing personalized learning materials, automating administrative tasks, and offering real-time feedback, it is unlikely to replace the role of human teachers entirely. The essence of teaching lies in its human elements—empathy, interaction, and the ability to inspire and motivate, which are unique to human educators. Therefore, the integration of AI in education should be seen as a tool to augment the capabilities of teachers, not replace them.
1285;Some people like to own the place where they live, but other people like to rent where they live. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The debate over whether it is better to own or rent the property in which one lives is one that has strong supporters on each side. There are persuasive arguments for both points of view.One of the main advantages of renting a property is flexibility. Usually, a tenant only has to give a month’s notice before changing where he or she lives. If a property is owned and a change is needed, the property must be put onto the market and it is frequently a long and stressful process to get a sale completed. Sometimes, the wrong time of year or a bad market can mean that a sale is not possible. Another advantage of renting is that a large amount of a family’s capital is not tied up in the property. Property can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and often a lot more. If one rents, this money can be spent on other things to help improve the family’s quality of life. If the property is on a mortgage, then the deposit, also often very large, is tied up in the property and the pressure of having to make substantial payments every month can cause a lot of stress.Owning a property does have various advantages, though. Even though people usually have to service a mortgage every month with payments, this money is then built up with the property. With renting, the money is lost to the landlord, but at the end of the term of the mortgage, the whole property is owned by the family. This makes the process of living in a property a type of investment. In addition, the property’s value often goes up after time, frequently creating a substantial profit. Owning the property where one lives can also create a sense of well-being and self-actualisation.The decision to whether one rents or owns the property in which one lives really boils down to individual preference. My opinion is that it is much more preferable to own a property, mainly because it creates a valuable asset for the family.;The debate about whether to own or rent a living space has been ongoing for years, with each side having its own advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, owning a place provides a sense of security and permanence, allowing individuals to put down roots and make long-term investments in their property. For instance, a homeowner can make modifications and improvements to the property without needing to consult with a landlord, giving them a sense of autonomy and control over their living space. Additionally, owning a property can be a valuable asset, potentially increasing in value over time and providing a nest egg for the future.On the other hand, renting a place offers flexibility and freedom, allowing individuals to move to different locations without being tied down to a specific property. Renters are also not responsible for maintenance and repair costs, which can be a significant financial burden. For example, a renter can easily relocate to a new city for work or personal reasons without having to worry about selling a property or dealing with the complexities of long-distance homeownership. Moreover, renting can be a more affordable option, especially for those who are not ready or able to commit to a long-term mortgage.In my opinion, renting is the more practical and appealing option, especially for young people or those who value flexibility. With the rising costs of living and the increasing uncertainty of the job market, renting provides a sense of freedom and adaptability that is hard to find with homeownership. Moreover, the money that would be spent on a down payment and mortgage can be invested elsewhere, such as in a retirement fund or a small business. However, for those who are ready to settle down and have a stable financial situation, owning a property can be a valuable and rewarding investment. Ultimately, the decision to own or rent depends on individual circumstances and priorities.
1405;Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding changes. Others, however think that change is always a good thing. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;Nowadays, people are arguing whether an ideal lifestyle should be a stable one or should it include a wide ranges of changes.In my opinion, whether changes are needed should be determined the of you are at.Apparently, are favorable the development of young people, in to their careers. Primarily, an abundant experience in varieties of jobs enables the young to master a broad range of techniques and skills, leading to significant edge over counterparts in the competition for employment. Meanwhile, trying various roles in life and work provides wide of lifestyles for the young in the future. Only after this comparison can they realize what the real goals of their .However, other than frequent changes, the elderly who have undergone all these challenges may pursue a steady lifestyle. For the elders, concentration on their favorite activities would give rise to a sense of enjoyment and security, which is helpful to physical and psychological health. Due to a stable life, the elderly are less exposed to stress, leading to a decrease in adrenal hormones and resulting in their well-.Furthermore, degeneration of mental and physical function would make the elderly unlikely to adapt to external changes, causing and , which are not contributing to their health.Above all, it is unlikely to describe the changes in life with a positive or negative term. Accommodation for personal needs and goals is more important than the changes themselves.;The debate surrounding the desirability of change in life has sparked intense discussion among individuals. On one hand, some people prefer to maintain a routine and avoid changes, as it provides them with a sense of stability and security. This approach allows them to develop a strong foundation and build upon familiar patterns, thereby reducing uncertainty and anxiety. For instance, a person working in a stable job may prefer to continue in the same role, as it offers predictable income and a clear understanding of their responsibilities.On the other hand, others believe that change is always a good thing, as it brings new experiences, opportunities, and personal growth. Embracing change enables individuals to step out of their comfort zones, challenge themselves, and discover new aspects of their personalities. Change can also lead to innovation, improved problem-solving skills, and a broader perspective on life. For example, traveling to new countries or taking up a new hobby can expose individuals to diverse cultures, ideas, and ways of thinking, thereby enriching their lives.In my opinion, a balance between stability and change is essential for a fulfilling life. While some degree of routine and predictability is necessary for emotional and financial security, excessive rigidity can lead to stagnation and boredom. Conversely, constant change can be overwhelming and stressful. Therefore, it is crucial to strike a balance between the two, allowing individuals to maintain a sense of stability while still embracing new experiences and challenges. By doing so, individuals can navigate the complexities of life with confidence, adaptability, and a willingness to learn and grow. Ultimately, a balanced approach to change and stability is key to leading a happy, engaging, and purposeful life.
1423;Some people say education is the only critical factor to the development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;One the one hand good education is a highly recommended skill in the developed countries, on the other hand of many people in regions of poverty. But what makes education key factor for the development of a countryWe must acknowledge that education is something that we all need. The differences are just what we learn. Mostly the limited educational horizons of poor and less educated people have more to deal with their personal situation than with problems of bigger effects on a country. Attending school is sometimes too expensive and it does not feed a family.Nevertheless there must be a reason for education. For me it looks like some countries have realized that Education is the key for the globalization process. If we take India for example we can see that a change in the educational system had changed the economy of the country. country has changed from a poor region to a high potential for IT knowledge.In regard to this fact of education seriously and offer it to a wide range of people. Spending money education is the key tippy title=”for”]to[/tippy] a new future effects on the economy and social life. All in all I agree with the importance of education for the development of a country. Less knowledge leads to poverty and . Learning and Knowledge is Power and an investment in the near future and therefore it has to be an official task.;The statement that education is the only critical factor to the development of a country is a notion that has sparked intense debate among scholars and policymakers. While education undoubtedly plays a vital role in the development of a nation, I strongly disagree that it is the only critical factor.On one hand, education is indeed a crucial element in fostering economic growth, social progress, and political stability. An educated population is better equipped to contribute to the workforce, innovate, and make informed decisions. Education empowers individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to participate in the global economy, thereby driving a country's development. Moreover, educated citizens are more likely to be active participants in the democratic process, leading to a more informed and engaged citizenry.On the other hand, there are numerous other factors that are equally, if not more, important in determining a country's development. For instance, a country's infrastructure, including roads, transportation systems, and communication networks, is essential for facilitating trade, commerce, and the exchange of ideas. Additionally, a stable and effective political system, a robust healthcare system, and a favorable business environment are also critical components of a country's development. Furthermore, access to resources, such as clean water, sanitation, and energy, is essential for ensuring the well-being and productivity of a nation's citizens.In conclusion, while education is undoubtedly a vital component of a country's development, it is by no means the only critical factor. A country's development is a complex and multifaceted process that requires a combination of educated citizens, robust infrastructure, effective governance, and access to essential resources. Therefore, it is essential to adopt a holistic approach to development, recognizing the interplay between these various factors, rather than relying solely on education as the sole driver of progress.
87;Some people say free time activities for children should be organized by parents. Others say that children should be free to choose what they do in their free time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Whether parents should fully intervene in their children's organization of their leisure time or let them decide it, remains a big discussion. In this essay I will contrast the two opinions and I will explain why I think a good balance is needed.One of the reasons supporting the first view is the idea of the undeveloped children's ability to organize. This is because, although some of them might seem very mature for their age, others might struggle understanding the importance of having a routine, besides playing video games. For instance, many parents orientate their children helping them to organize hobbies and teaching a very important skill, time managment.On the other hand, some people encourage children to decide themselves what to do as this stimulates creativity and personal growth. This view, therefore, opens a new world for the little ones who can decide whatever they like, having multiple options. For example, children in this situation quite often are supported when they want to play sports or participate in a painting class.In my opinion, parents should not only be envolved as much as they can in all aspects of their children's lives, but also they might encourage the little ones to have personal opinions and decision about their hobbies and leisure actitivities. This may be a good way to build trust and communication between parents and children. Moreover, children learn responsability while being guided by their parents.In conclusion, some parents help their children more in scheduling their free time, while others intervene less leaving them to create a routine freely. I believe, parents should always be involved in their children's lives and decisions, allowing children participation too, which brings multiple benefits to their relationship.;The debate surrounding how children should spend their free time has sparked a heated discussion among parents and experts. On one hand, some people argue that parents should organize free time activities for children, as it provides them with a sense of structure and security. Organized activities, such as sports teams or music lessons, can help children develop important skills, as well as socialize with their peers. This approach can also ensure that children are engaged in safe and supervised environments, shielding them from potential harm.On the other hand, others believe that children should be free to choose what they do in their free time, allowing them to explore their interests and develop a sense of autonomy. Unstructured free time enables children to think creatively, make their own decisions, and learn from their mistakes. Moreover, it gives them the opportunity to relax and recharge, which is essential for their mental and physical well-being. Overly structured schedules can lead to stress and burnout, undermining the benefits of extracurricular activities.In my opinion, a balance between the two approaches is necessary. While some organized activities can be beneficial, it is equally important to give children the freedom to make their own choices and explore their interests. By doing so, parents can help their children develop a sense of responsibility, independence, and self-motivation. Ultimately, it is crucial for parents to understand their child's individual needs and find a balance that works best for them. By striking a balance between structure and freedom, parents can help their children develop into happy, confident, and well-rounded individuals.
1330;Some people say that all popular TV entertainment programmes should aim to educate viewers about important social issues. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It is often said that all influential TV entertainment programs should be geared towards raising people’s awareness about social issues that matter. While some TV programs could be suitable for this purpose, I disagree with the view that it should be mandatory for all of them, as the decision whether to do so must take into account the nature of the TV content and the channel’s audience.There is a large group of professionals who would benefit from deepening their understanding of what is happening in the world. Stock traders and bankers, for example, must always keep track of numerous business trends on a global scale, and they would appreciate this type of information on their favourite TV shows. Young people are another suitable audience due to the fact that they enjoy learning about popular topics from TV programmes. For instance, SDGs or the Sustainable Development Goals has now become an important topic to learn for children at school. Educational TV would provide a welcome alternative to textbooks, making learning more fun.Despite the potential advantages of incorporating educational content in TV programs, it is important to remember that the purpose of entertainment TV is for people to escape reality, to take a break from their hectic lives. Being reminded about some troubling social issues would not be appreciated by those who just want to unwind after a long day at work. Another consideration is how the content is perceived by the audience, because broadcasting serious topics as part of a comedy show might lead some viewers to believe they are of lesser significance. This would make TV shows of light-hearted nature a poor choice for inclusion of content on pressing social issues.In conclusion, entertainment TV programs can be an effective form of education for some people and a great tool to spread information. However, not all of them should be used for this purpose as there are various ways people appreciate them.;The notion that all popular TV entertainment programmes should aim to educate viewers about important social issues has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that these programmes have a responsibility to inform and raise awareness about social issues, I only partially agree with this statement.On the one hand, the impact of popular TV entertainment programmes on their audience cannot be overstated. With millions of viewers tuning in every day, they have the potential to shape public opinion and influence cultural norms. By incorporating social issues into their storylines, these programmes can raise awareness about important topics such as racism, sexism, and environmental degradation. This can lead to a more informed and empathetic audience, which is essential for creating a more just and equitable society.On the other hand, popular TV entertainment programmes are primarily designed to entertain, not educate. Viewers tune in to relax and be entertained, not to be lectured or preached to. If every programme were to focus on educating viewers about social issues, it would likely lead to a decline in viewership and a loss of credibility for the programme. Furthermore, there are other mediums, such as documentaries and news programmes, that are better suited to educating viewers about social issues.In conclusion, while I agree that popular TV entertainment programmes can play a role in educating viewers about social issues, I do not think that it should be their primary goal. A balance between entertainment and education is necessary, with programmes incorporating social issues in a way that is organic and respectful to their audience. By doing so, they can raise awareness about important issues without compromising their entertainment value.
1353;Some people say that arts subjects are as essential as academic ones and should be part of school syllabus (agree/disagree);"Some people say that art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are an essential part of education, and every school should include them in its syllabus. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your opinion and examples from your own experience.Art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are fundamentals that enrich our lives. However, some parents say schools on teaching more academic subjects, such as mathematics, science, literature and history. In my opinion, both academic and arts subjects should be taught and I will expand on the pros and cons of including arts in the school program further on in this essay.On the one hand, academic subjects are often required when we get into higher . Academic subjects may be considered as in the academic world. Personally, I have never taken an entrance exam of art subjects for high school or university. In other words, schools measured my academic abilities using academic subjects, not art subjects. To suit the current educational system, many parents in my home country, Japan, send their children to cram schools to study academic subjects deeply.On the other hand, art subjects can strengthen the creativity and flexibility of individuals. Liberal arts, which include cultural understanding and knowledge, also include other arts subjects. In addition, we are living in the era of automation and artificial intelligence which are replacing human labor and office work more and more. In this regard, human creativity becomes more important. Therefore, art subjects are being more in demand to make a difference between individuals and computers.In conclusion, academic and arts subjects should blend in a school syllabus in a balanced way. Art subjects can also a better personality in individuals, so participation in these classes should be encouraged as well as academic achievements.The writer explored the reasons why including arts subjects in school syllabus is a good idea, while fluently expressing ideas and supporting them by examples. Correct paragraphing assists with orderly presentation of information, making this essay easy to follow; the range of vocabulary is quite wide. Accuracy of expression needs a bit more attention (see corrections underlined in blue), but overall, this essay could achieve IELTS Band 8.";The importance of arts subjects in schools has been a topic of debate for a long time. While some people believe that arts subjects are not as crucial as academic ones, I firmly agree that they are equally essential and should be part of the school syllabus. Arts subjects, such as music, dance, and painting, provide students with a unique opportunity to express themselves creatively and develop their imagination.Incorporating arts subjects into the school curriculum can have numerous benefits for students. For instance, it can help improve their cognitive skills, such as memory and concentration, as well as enhance their critical thinking abilities. Additionally, arts subjects can foster creativity, self-confidence, and self-expression, which are essential life skills. Moreover, arts subjects can provide students with a platform to explore their talents and interests, which can lead to a more fulfilling and purposeful life.Furthermore, arts subjects can also have a positive impact on students' academic performance. Research has shown that students who participate in arts programs tend to perform better in their academic subjects, such as math and reading. This is because arts subjects can help students develop their problem-solving skills, hand-eye coordination, and spatial reasoning, which are all essential skills for academic success.In conclusion, I strongly believe that arts subjects are as essential as academic ones and should be part of the school syllabus. They provide students with a wide range of benefits, from improving their cognitive skills to fostering creativity and self-expression. By incorporating arts subjects into the school curriculum, we can help students develop into well-rounded, creative, and confident individuals who are equipped to succeed in all areas of life. Therefore, it is essential that schools prioritize arts subjects and provide students with the opportunity to explore their creative potential.
779;Some people say that modern technology has made shopping today easier, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion;It is commonly argued that the fast pacing technology has helped people do shopping at the present time more easily. However, some people think online shopping is really difficult for them. This essay will consider both the advantages and disadvantages of the use of technology for shopping.One disadvantage of online shopping can be mentioned is that people cannot familiarize themselves with online applications for ordering essential goods and food. In fact, the elderly are not good at technology enough to go to virtual supermarkets. Besides, those who live in remote areas are not accessible easily to technology to buy online groceries.Despite its disadvantage, online shopping has brought about advantages for those who are technology natives. Firstly, it can be time-saving. In fact, shoppers can order any things they need with some clicks on the items, payment method, and time of delivery. Especially in a lingering Covid-19, when social distancing measures have been effective in some places in Viet Nam, according to a survey, the number of online shoppers has been increasing day by day, and thus many applications have been into existence, developed, and thrived.Another advantage of virtual shopping is that it can be life-saving to many people in a pandemic across nations. Going to supermarkets can be detrimental to buyers due to the spread of viruses and the higher risk of infection. For example, in order to buy bread for breakfast, people have to go out for it and thus may be exposed to infectious or incubated victims of Covid-19. Moreover, with preventive measures of Covid-19 containment, such as people not being allowed to go out for their essential goods, if they do not know how to make an online order, it is really difficult for them to survive during a pandemic.In conclusion, the use of technology for virtual shopping is beneficial to our time-saving and life-saving matters, though it is not familiar to some people. In my opinion, thanks to its advantages, I will continue to go shopping online, though the world has gone through the Covid-19 pandemic successfully.;The advent of modern technology has revolutionized the way people shop, sparking a debate about its impact on the shopping experience. On one hand, some people argue that modern technology has made shopping easier. With the rise of e-commerce, consumers can now browse and purchase products from the comfort of their own homes, 24 hours a day. Online shopping platforms offer a wide range of products, competitive prices, and convenient delivery options, making it easier for people to shop without having to physically visit stores. Additionally, mobile apps and digital payment systems have streamlined the checkout process, reducing waiting times and minimizing the need for cash and credit cards.On the other hand, others disagree, citing the drawbacks of modern technology in shopping. For instance, online shopping can be frustrating when products do not match their online descriptions, or when delivery times are delayed. Moreover, the lack of human interaction and personalized customer service can make online shopping feel impersonal and isolating. Some people also argue that the constant bombardment of advertisements and promotions on social media and online platforms can be overwhelming and make the shopping experience more stressful.In my opinion, modern technology has indeed made shopping easier and more convenient. While there are some drawbacks, the benefits of online shopping, such as convenience, flexibility, and accessibility, outweigh the drawbacks. Furthermore, many retailers are now incorporating technology to enhance the in-store shopping experience, such as using augmented reality to help customers try out products virtually. Overall, modern technology has transformed the shopping landscape, offering consumers more choices, convenience, and flexibility than ever before.
1401;Some people say that the Internet is making the world smaller by bringing people together. To what extent do you agree that the internet is making it easier for people to communicate with one another?;In today’s world due to the advancement of technology new inventions are coming into existence. It is true that ‘Necessity is a mother of invention’.

Today’s teenagers usually prefer to spend their time on the internet rather than in other physical activities, which causing them to have a weaker physical health.To conclude, I would like to say that the Internet is one of the most modernized and most successful tools, not only for regarding every field in a very short period of time.;The advent of the internet has revolutionized the way people communicate with each other. In my opinion, I strongly agree that the internet is making it easier for people to communicate with one another, thereby making the world smaller.On the one hand, the internet has bridged geographical gaps by providing a platform for people to connect with others from all over the world. Social media platforms, email, and messaging apps have made it possible for people to communicate with others across different time zones and geographical locations. This has enabled people to maintain relationships, make new friends, and even find business opportunities globally. For instance, a person in the United States can easily communicate with someone in Japan or Australia, fostering global connections and networking.On the other hand, the internet has also facilitated communication among people with shared interests and hobbies. Online forums, discussion groups, and blogs have created spaces for people to share ideas, exchange information, and collaborate on projects. This has enabled people to connect with others who share similar passions and interests, regardless of their geographical location. Furthermore, the internet has also enabled people to access information and resources from anywhere in the world, promoting global understanding and knowledge sharing.In conclusion, the internet has undoubtedly made it easier for people to communicate with one another, bringing the world closer together. The numerous benefits of internet-based communication, including global connectivity, access to information, and opportunities for collaboration, have made it an indispensable tool in modern life. As the internet continues to evolve, it is likely that its role in facilitating global communication will only continue to grow, making the world an even smaller and more interconnected place.
727;Some people say that the experiences a child has before starting school have the most influence on their future life. Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. Discuss both views and give your own opinion?;There are a lot of research about development in human life, Some people say that the experiences a child has before starting school have the most influence on their future life. Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. In the following paragraph, I will discuss both view and give my opinion.On the one hands, There has a research that bad experience in children before begining at school, especcially in family, will become unforgettable deep heart. For example, Children who live with strict parents and has aggressive punishment when children doing littie wrong things. In the future, Children will tend to aggressive and feeling they has not received a love from family. This research surely reasonnable because family is an important factor of social life.On the other hands, There have an opinion even if children was velvet glove when raised with family. However, Especially in adolescent, Friend and teacher can infleuence as same as family because teenagers spend more time at school that with family as a reason learning in classroom more than primary school and have a more group work with friend. Thus, If teenager prefer to close with a good student (not smoking or drinking alcohol / invite classroom friends travel education museum in weekends or holiday), Parents can make sure that your child will mature to standard adults.In conclusion, In my opinion, Children would be infleuenced by family before begining at school. After that, They will has a lot of complex relationship in school from friends and teachers that can infleuences children. So, Children should try to control yourself in moral to be a best quality adults.;The debate about which life stage has the most significant impact on an individual's future life has sparked intense discussion. Some argue that the experiences a child has before starting school are the most influential, while others claim that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, play a more critical role. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and provide my opinion.On the one hand, the early years of a child's life are crucial in shaping their future. The experiences they have before starting school, such as their home environment and relationships with family members, lay the foundation for their social, emotional, and cognitive development. For instance, a child who is exposed to a nurturing and supportive environment is more likely to develop a strong sense of self-esteem and confidence, which can positively impact their future life. Moreover, research has shown that early childhood experiences can affect a child's brain development, influencing their ability to learn and succeed in school.On the other hand, experiences as a teenager, especially at school, can also have a profound impact on an individual's future life. The teenage years are a time of significant physical, emotional, and social change, and the experiences they have during this period can shape their identity, values, and goals. For example, a teenager who is encouraged to participate in extracurricular activities or sports can develop important life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. Additionally, the relationships they form with peers and teachers can influence their academic performance, career choices, and overall well-being.In my opinion, both perspectives are valid, and it is difficult to pinpoint a single life stage as the most influential. However, I believe that the experiences a child has before starting school lay the foundation for their future success, while the experiences they have as a teenager, especially at school, can build upon this foundation and shape their specific life path. Ultimately, a combination of positive early childhood experiences and supportive teenage years can provide an individual with the best possible start in life.
337;Some people think history has nothing or little to tell us, but others think that studying the past history can help us better understand the present. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;With the development of technology, an increasing number of people try to acquire the latest technology such as computer programming, rather than to study history. There is a debate whether studying histroy could give us more advantages to understand the present society. In my opinion, obtaining knowledge of past history would be definitely helpful for us to live well in society today. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.To begin with, looking back on history would give us the opportunity to notice mistakes which human beings used to make in the past. Specifically, all kinds of people and countries around the world had made innumerable mistakes throughout history. Besides, some of these mistakes might result in a huge number of victims. Therefore, human beings must avoid these tragedic events happening again. Above all, only knowing history could lead to avoidance of the recurrences. To be more specific, World War must be one of the serious events in human being history, and understanding of this truth have a significant impact on how we should live not to cause war again in the present society. It is manifest that leaning history is meaningful in this regard.On the other hand, some arguments can be made that old stories have little something to do with our present lives. However, closer examination would reveal that all the relationships present today originally come from something in the past. Knowing history enables us to find the best way to a fruitful future. The compelling example of this is racial discrimination in the U.S. Understanding the U.S. history could give us the best manner not to deteriorate relationships in the U.S. I suppose that studying history would be helpful for all human beings from this aspect.Having considered all the arguments above, learning history would be a major contributor to a better understanding of the present because we can know how to avoid the same mistake people used to made and how we should behave for the better result through history.;The relevance of studying history has been a topic of debate among individuals, with some believing it has little significance in today's world, while others argue that it plays a crucial role in understanding the present. On one hand, those who think history has nothing to tell us, point out that it is a collection of past events that cannot be changed. They believe that focusing on history diverts attention and resources away from pressing current issues and future challenges. Moreover, they argue that historical context is often subjective and can be interpreted in various ways, making it less reliable as a tool for understanding the present.On the other hand, others firmly believe that studying the past is essential to grasping the complexities of the present. History provides valuable lessons on how societies, cultures, and governments have evolved over time, offering insights into the consequences of past decisions and actions. By examining historical events, we can identify patterns, causes, and effects that continue to shape our world today. For instance, understanding the history of global conflicts can inform diplomatic efforts and policy-making, while learning from past economic crises can help prevent future ones. Furthermore, history preserves the cultural heritage and traditions of societies, enriching our understanding of diverse perspectives and experiences.In my opinion, studying history is indispensable for understanding the present. The past and present are intertwined, with historical events and trends continuing to influence contemporary issues. By neglecting history, we risk repeating past mistakes and failing to learn from the successes and failures of those who came before us. Therefore, I believe that history has a significant amount to tell us, and its study should be encouraged and valued as a means to navigate and make sense of the complexities of our modern world.
411;Some people think students should study the science of food and how to prepare it. Others think that school time should be used in learning important subjects. Discuss both views and give your opinion?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;These days a portion of the society consider that students must learn the subject of cooking food and ways to make meals meanwhile, a group of people think that educational institutions shall be used to study more essential courses. I strongly agree that schools should be used for learning far important subjects rather than cooking classes. In this essay a im going to examin and discuss both phenomenon viewpoints and draw my personal opinion.In one hand, some people think that cooking and food subjects should be an important courses in schools,in addition, the steps of preparing meals and information about food may help students for a healthy lifestyle.On the other hand, a group of individuals consider that cooking is a hobby and cooking classes must be optional to the student and not requiered for all students, to illustrate even more, a bigger portion of students may not be interested in cooking as others,whereas, schools must be used for more serious purposes ,for example, studying more complicated courses will have a positive effect on the students academic outcomes ,meanwhile, adding courses such as cooking might effect the students time manegement and influence their ability to focus on the important things,for further explaination, if they have a test or different assignments deadlines they should be really focusing on that rather than attending cooking classes.In conclustion, and after analysis of both penomenon i presonally believe that cooking classes should not be considered as an essential course for students in educational institutions.;The debate surrounding the inclusion of cooking and food science in school curricula has sparked intense discussion. On one hand, some individuals argue that students should dedicate their time to studying the science of food and how to prepare it. They believe that acquiring culinary skills is essential for a healthy and independent life. By learning about nutrition, food safety, and meal preparation, students can develop vital life skills that will benefit them throughout their lives. For instance, a student who learns how to cook can make informed decisions about their diet, leading to a healthier lifestyle.On the other hand, others think that school time should be allocated to learning important subjects such as mathematics, language, and science. They argue that these subjects provide a solid foundation for future academic and professional success. According to them, time spent on cooking and food science could be better utilized to focus on core subjects that are crucial for a student's intellectual development. For example, a student who excels in mathematics and science may have better prospects for pursuing a career in engineering or medicine.In my opinion, I think that both views have merit, but I lean towards the idea that students should learn about the science of food and how to prepare it. In today's world, where obesity and diet-related diseases are prevalent, learning about nutrition and cooking can have a significant impact on a student's well-being. Moreover, cooking can be a fun and engaging way to learn about measurements, fractions, and other mathematical concepts, making it an excellent way to reinforce academic learning. By incorporating cooking and food science into school curricula, educators can provide students with a holistic education that prepares them for a healthy, independent, and successful life.
59;Some people think that governments should ban dangerous sports, while others think people should have freedom to do any sports or activity. Discuss both views and give your own opinion;From the known history of the humanity, many sports or activities have been done to enjoy ourselfs, keeping in shape, or spent time. Grown up people should be free to do any kind of sports or activities by their will unless they are not hurting anyone else except theirselfs.Some people think when a citizen hurt his/herself, tax payers need to pay for the health care fees, and it should not be consern for the tax payers since they are paying only for fundamental situations. This point of view is not matching with the freedom. Yes, there might be a fee for tax payers, yet freedom should be above on all fees. While some people prefers less dangerous activities, others can be interested in more dangerous activities, as well.Governments can have some precautions to make citizens' life better. Yet, they should not involve such things like banning sports since it is the preference of the people which dealing with the dangerous sports. Some people could want to make more unique or exciting sports, and it is quite natural. Banning such kind of activities can be considered as limiting people's freedom.Since most of the people living together for a quite time in a society, people should pay respect on each others preferences, unless it is not interesting other people's personal area. As a calm and relax person, I am not intend to make dangerous sports or activities. However, I do not think that I have the right or power to say other people what should they do or not, and vice versa.;"The debate on whether governments should ban dangerous sports or allow people the freedom to participate in any activity has sparked intense discussion. On one hand, some people believe that governments have a responsibility to protect their citizens from harm, and therefore, should ban sports that pose a significant risk to participants. This view is based on the idea that the government has a duty to ensure public safety and prevent unnecessary injuries or deaths. For instance, sports like big wave surfing, rock climbing, or street luging can be extremely hazardous, and banning them could potentially save lives.On the other hand, some argue that individuals should have the freedom to choose their own activities, including those that are deemed ""dangerous"". This perspective is rooted in the idea of personal autonomy and the belief that people should be able to make their own decisions about the risks they are willing to take. Proponents of this view argue that banning certain sports would be an overreach of government power and could stifle innovation and progress in these fields. Moreover, many dangerous sports have inherent benefits, such as building character, discipline, and physical fitness, which could be lost if they were to be banned.In my opinion, while the government has a role in protecting its citizens, it should not ban dangerous sports outright. Instead, it could implement stricter safety regulations, provide better safety equipment, and ensure that participants are adequately trained and informed of the risks involved. This approach would balance the need to protect individuals with the importance of preserving personal freedom and autonomy. Ultimately, people should be allowed to make their own choices about the activities they participate in, as long as they are aware of the potential risks and take necessary precautions to minimize harm. By finding a middle ground, we can promote both safety and freedom, allowing individuals to pursue their passions while also protecting them from unnecessary harm."
1325;Some people think that hosting an international sporting event is beneficial for a country, while others disagree. Do the advantages of hosting a major sporting event outweigh its disadvantages?;International sporting events are well-known for attracting a high level of attention because they give many people something to look forward to. Understandably, there are advantages and disadvantages for the host country, and careful consideration is required to determine whether a nation will benefit or lose from hosting a major sports championship.Worryingly, the new infrastructure required for hosting a major sporting event often comes at the expense of local people. Their lives get disrupted by construction works and at times residents have even been evicted from their homes for stadiums to be built. Worse still, practice shows the expensive, gigantic buildings constructed for the sports event aren’t being used afterwards and fall into disrepair, leaving the country with high maintenance bills. The financial burden from hosting the Olympic Games, for example, is staggering and can run into tens of billions. Still, the question remains whether or not the pros outnumber the cons.It is hard to underestimate the amount of influence on the country’s global status and prestige that comes with becoming a home to an international sporting event. New trade opportunities appear on the horizon, as it happened for many countries that hosted the Olympic Games. There is also a welcome increase in tourism, which gives the local economy a boost, injecting billions of dollars into the national budget. Construction of new stadiums, hotels and infrastructure such as new roads and rail links creates new jobs, further improving the country’s economy. Less tangible but still important is the aspect of national pride and the feel-good factor associated with hosting an international sports event.All in all, it seems to me that an international sporting event can bring more good than harm to a country, especially if its potential dangers can be avoided or minimised. Hosting a World Championship is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a country and an immense source of pride for its citizens.;The question of whether hosting an international sporting event is beneficial for a country has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that the advantages of hosting such an event outweigh its disadvantages, others strongly disagree. In this essay, I will examine both sides of the argument and provide my perspective.On the one hand, hosting a major sporting event can bring numerous benefits to a country. For instance, it can boost tourism, create jobs, and stimulate economic growth. The influx of visitors and athletes can also promote cultural exchange and showcase the country's unique heritage. Furthermore, the event can inspire national pride and unity, fostering a sense of community and shared identity among citizens.On the other hand, there are significant drawbacks to consider. Hosting a major sporting event can be extremely costly, requiring substantial investments in infrastructure, such as stadiums, roads, and accommodation. These expenses can divert funds away from essential public services, such as healthcare and education. Additionally, the event can also lead to disruptions in daily life, including traffic congestion and noise pollution.In my opinion, the advantages of hosting a major sporting event do outweigh its disadvantages. While the costs are significant, the long-term benefits, including increased tourism and economic growth, can have a lasting impact on the country's development. Moreover, with careful planning and management, the negative effects can be mitigated. Ultimately, hosting an international sporting event can be a valuable opportunity for a country to promote itself on the global stage, while also bringing its people together in a shared experience of excitement and pride.
575;Some people think that hosting international sports events may be beneficial for a country. Discuss both views.;Certain people believe that organizing international sports competitions could benefit host countries. While hosting sport events might also entail risks, I firmly believe that nations would gain much more than they would lose, as I will explain below.International sport competitions are usually large events that bring together thousands of people including athletes, staff, and tourists. This usually represents an attractive opportunity for local business and investors. People need to be fed, thus activating restaurants' economy. Additionally, they need a place to sleep and rest, which would benefit hotels. On the other hand, many countries hosting international competitions build new infrastructure, including stadiums, pools, public squares, and even airports. It is clear that several cities around the world have developed as a result of hosting such events. Let us take the example of the city Montreal in Canada, which hosted the olympic games a few decades ago. Organizing sports events also represents an opportunitty to improve the international image of a country. For example, it is not a secret that some countries such as Germany and Russia have used the World Cup to improve their international image, with positive results overall. Finally, since inhabitants of the host nation would feel inspired to practice a new sport, we could argue that competitions could additionally improve the health and wellbeing of citizens in the long term.It is important to mention, however, that hosting sport events might also entail some risks. These competitions are usually complex and expensive to organize, and middle- or low-income economies could better use their resources to build vital infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools. Moreover, examples around the world illustrate that some politicians see these events as an opportunity for curruption.In conclusion, there are more benefits than risks for countries when it comes to hosting international sport events. These events might translate into economic opportunities for local business and investors, could bring new infrastructure, and may trigger development.;The hosting of international sports events has sparked a heated debate, with some individuals believing it to be advantageous for a country, while others disagree. On the one hand, hosting such events can bring numerous benefits to the host nation. For instance, it can boost tourism, as thousands of spectators and athletes flock to the country, thereby injecting significant revenue into the local economy. Additionally, the infrastructure developed for the event, such as stadiums and transportation systems, can leave a lasting legacy, enhancing the quality of life for citizens and providing a catalyst for future development.On the other hand, there are those who argue that the costs associated with hosting international sports events far outweigh the benefits. The construction of stadiums, arenas, and other facilities requires massive investment, which can divert funds away from essential public services such as healthcare and education. Furthermore, the event itself may only last for a short period, but the financial burden and debt incurred can be felt by the host country for years to come. Moreover, the disruption caused to daily life, including traffic congestion and increased security measures, can also be a significant drawback.In conclusion, while hosting international sports events can undoubtedly bring economic and infrastructural benefits to a country, it is crucial to carefully weigh these advantages against the potential financial and social drawbacks. A balanced approach, considering both the short-term gains and long-term consequences, is essential for any country contemplating hosting such an event. Ultimately, the decision to host should be made with the welfare and interests of the country's citizens at the forefront.
1017;Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Whilie some people believe that we can live with climate change instead of dealing with that, I don't agree with this idea because climate change can bring various disadvantages for our life.There are many disadvantages of climate change which can gradually push animals and also human to extinction. First and foremost, climate change promote the process of global warming which is one of the most dangerous result of climate change. Because of this situation, ice in 2 polar areas is melting day by day. As a result, the level of sea water will go up. Therefore, countries which are near by the sea may be drown in the future. Another drawback of climate change is that it causes many disaster. The figure for disaster is predicted to increase because of climate change. Hence, people and animals will have to deal with many dangerous disaster which can bring a lot of damage.Beside, I believe there are also many way to prevent climate change. Firstly, from my perspective, education is the best way to deal with the changing of climate. Because education raises the awareness of people about how dangerous climate change is, and it also teach people to protect the environment. Therefore, the effect of climate change will decrease. Secondly, local community should hold more volunteer activity for people to clean the palace where they live, so people can make sense of environmental protection and their neighborhood will also be cleaned. This activity can also contribute to prevent climate changeIn conclusion, I believe that people can't live with climate change and people have to prevent it.;The notion that instead of preventing climate change, we should focus on finding ways to live with it has sparked intense debate. While some argue that adapting to the inevitable consequences of climate change is the most pragmatic approach, I only partially agree with this stance.On the one hand, adapting to climate change is undoubtedly crucial, especially for communities that are already experiencing its devastating impacts. For instance, coastal cities are investing heavily in sea walls and flood-resistant construction to mitigate the effects of rising sea levels. Similarly, countries prone to droughts are developing innovative irrigation systems and drought-resistant crops to ensure food security. These measures are essential for protecting human lives and livelihoods in the face of climate uncertainty.On the other hand, I strongly believe that prevention should remain our primary goal. The consequences of unchecked climate change are catastrophic, including mass extinctions, extreme weather events, and unprecedented human migrations. If we focus solely on adaptation without addressing the root causes of climate change—such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to renewable energy sources—we risk exacerbating the problem. Prevention through sustainable practices and policies can mitigate the severity of climate change, making adaptation more manageable and less costly in the long run.In conclusion, while adapting to climate change is essential and requires immediate attention, it should not come at the expense of prevention efforts. A balanced approach that prioritizes both prevention and adaptation strategies is necessary. By reducing our carbon footprint and transitioning to sustainable models of development, we can minimize the impacts of climate change and create resilient communities that can thrive in a changing world. Ultimately, living with climate change should not be seen as an alternative to preventing it, but rather as a complementary strategy to ensure a sustainable future for all.
1341;Some people think that it is fine for professional athletes to misbehave on or off the field, as long as they are playing well (opinion);"Some people think that it is fine for professional sportsmen and sportswomen to misbehave on or off the field, as long as they are playing well.Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Sample EssayAlthough most professional athletes are aware of their position as role models for their fans and behave accordingly, there are sportsmen and sportswomen who behave poorly during matches and in their private life. While some people find it acceptable as long as their performance on the field is not impacted, not everyone agrees with that point of view.Those who put athletes’ performance on the field above everything else point out that competitive environment and immense pressure the sports people are under affect their behavior. They argue that athletes are entitled to privacy and their actions before and after games should not concern the general public. I find this hard to agree with, because poor behavior in sports people is incompatible with their role in public’s life and also for the reason that their actions could negatively affect their entire sports industry.The main reason why I believe athletes should behave well at all times is that their behavior is tremendously influential. Spectators respect players and many copy their actions and behavior; therefore, if top players misbehave or violate laws, some of the fans may feel compelled to follow their example and behave badly. For example, after an acclaimed baseball player was caught using drugs some years ago, the number of people who were arrested for the same crime significantly increased. This shows quite clearly why high profile players should consider their actions very carefully in order to promote a peaceful society.In addition, the behavior of athletes might affect the popularity of their sports. Some companies sponsor successful athletes who boost their brand recognition and sales of their products. Players and sports industry executives are financially compensated for endorsing products and participating in commercial advertisements. If they demonstrate poor behavior, sponsors could direct their money elsewhere, and as a result sports matches could suffer due to lack of funds. To illustrate, Sumo, a traditional Japanese sport, is held every season thanks to resources donated by companies. In a year when a Sumo player was involved in a violent crime, no matches were held, resulting in a large deficit of funds.In conclusion, I completely disagree with the opinion that top athletes are permitted to behave badly because their behavior may negatively influence the public behavior and sports industry itself.Assessor’s comment: This response addresses both sides of the argument by exploring the reasons why some people think athletes are allowed to behave poorly as long as they play well, and the reasons why others think poor behavior has no excuse. This response deserves a high score for task achievement because of that. A good range of cohesive devices is used in this essay; that and the organisation of ideas makes it easy to follow. Sentence structures are varied and the vocabulary is quite rich, the author also showed good control of grammar and spelling. It is worth noting that this sample is longer than the recommended 260 – 285 words, however, this isn’t an issue provided the author can complete an essay of this length and quality in under 40 minutes. Overall this is a good example of a Band 8 essay.";The notion that professional athletes can misbehave on or off the field as long as they perform well has sparked intense debate. While some people subscribe to this opinion, arguing that an athlete's primary responsibility is to deliver results, others contend that this mindset is misguided and problematic. In my opinion, the latter perspective holds more weight.Professional athletes are not only role models but also ambassadors of their respective sports, brands, and often, their countries. Their actions, both on and off the field, are scrutinized by fans, media, and the younger generation who look up to them for inspiration. Allowing misbehavior simply because an athlete is performing well sends a wrong message - that winning justifies misconduct. This not only undermines the values of fair play and sportsmanship but also perpetuates a culture where ethics and morality are compromised for the sake of victory.Moreover, tolerating misbehavior can have serious consequences, both for the athlete and the community. Athletes who engage in misconduct may face legal repercussions, damage to their reputation, and potential loss of endorsements. Furthermore, their behavior can influence young fans, potentially leading to the normalization of undesirable conduct in everyday life. The impact on team dynamics and the overall integrity of the sport should also not be overlooked.It is essential for professional leagues, teams, and sponsors to hold athletes to high standards of conduct, ensuring that they are accountable for their actions. By doing so, we promote a culture that values both excellence in performance and integrity in character. Ultimately, the excellence of a professional athlete should be measured not just by their prowess on the field, but also by their character off it. By expecting more from our athletes, we not only uphold the dignity of sports but also contribute to a society that respects and adheres to moral and ethical principles.
1422;Some people think that it is important to use leisure time for activities that develop the mind, such as reading and doing crossword puzzles. Others feel that it is important to give one’s mind a rest in leisure time. Discuss.;As we are human we naturally need to rest leisure time to stress of work and everyday life. In fact, every individual need to do what they want and . Personally, I prefer to be active during this time because . Moreover, people are free what they do their leisure time, and nobody can say what is the best.Some people want to relax after their day of work. These people may prefer to relax by watching movies, reading or getting a massage. People who have a such as doctors, teachers and builders may choose these types of activities. If you are a doctor, you may feel that you want to let your body rest after work and you don’t want to do a five kilometer run after work, because you are already physically tired.On the other hand, some people choose to be active in their leisure time because they do . For example, these people many spend all day sitting on a chair and their work. At the end of a working day, they a backache, and all of their body tired so they need to stretch their arms and improve their health by doing some activity such as going to the gym or swimming.To sum up, the important thing is that people want to stay healthy by choosing what is best for them. In my view, the wrong way is to stay at home in your leisure time if you have a job.;The utilization of leisure time has sparked a debate among individuals, with some advocating for mentally stimulating activities and others promoting relaxation and mental reprieve. On one hand, the engagement in activities such as reading and doing crossword puzzles can be highly beneficial for cognitive development and mental agility. These pursuits not only enhance memory and problem-solving skills but also broaden one's knowledge and understanding of the world. Furthermore, they can be a source of enjoyment and personal fulfillment, leading to a more satisfying and productive life.On the other hand, there are those who argue that leisure time should be used to give the mind a rest, allowing it to recharge and rejuvenate. In today's fast-paced and often stressful world, it is essential to provide the mind with an opportunity to unwind and relax. Engaging in activities that are mentally taxing during leisure time can lead to mental fatigue, decreased motivation, and a heightened sense of burnout. Moreover, relaxation and mental reprieve can have numerous physical and mental health benefits, such as reduced stress levels, improved mood, and enhanced overall well-being.Ultimately, a balance between mental stimulation and relaxation is crucial for maintaining a healthy and productive lifestyle. While it is essential to challenge and develop the mind, it is equally important to provide it with periods of rest and relaxation. By incorporating a mix of both mentally stimulating activities and relaxing pursuits into our leisure time, we can promote cognitive development, reduce stress, and improve our overall quality of life. Therefore, it is not necessarily a question of which approach is superior, but rather how we can strike a balance between the two to achieve a harmonious and fulfilling life.
1215;Some people think that it is important to use leisure time for activities that improve the mind, such as reading and doing word puzzles.Other people feel that it is important to rest the mind during leisure time.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.Write at least 250 words.;Leisure period from our everyday busy schedules is absolutely a well cherished time by most people. What should exactly be done during this free time has been the subject of debate for a while. Some would argue that engaging in simple and less brain tasking activities during this time keeps the mind busy,facilitates mental alertness and sanity.While other scholars would argue that keeping the mind relaxed would improve focus and recharge the mind for when needed at work after the free period has waned off.On the one hand, it seems beneficial to engage in activities that keeps the mind slightly engaged during our leisure period. This is basically due to the fact that some mind consciousness might be lost when idle.Sluggishness may thereforeset in when required to partake in activities that requires full attention. Hence playing chess and games might help maintain ones' awareness during a less busy period. Secondly, getting involved in basic activities like reading and surfing the internet during these free period could also help improve ones intellectual capacity and also overall general knowledge that could well be very beneficial to improving the entire state of the mind.On the other hand, those who say its essential to rest the mind after extensive period of activities might have a point.This is because resting the mind will help recharge Ones' batteries and general condition of the mind. Take for instance, a Tech inclined engineer that uses his mind and brain a lot to profer solutions to complex problems. A liitle period to be calm and relaxed will be of utmost importance to alleviate a potential mind and thoughts exhaustion.In conclusion, while it seems very important and beneficial to rest the mind during leisure period to aid rebooting of the mind and brain.I strongly believe that getting involved is some innovative and creative activities during these period improves our general state of health and mind.;The debate about how to utilize leisure time has sparked a heated discussion among individuals. On one hand, some people believe that leisure time should be dedicated to mentally stimulating activities such as reading and doing word puzzles, as these activities enhance cognitive function and promote personal growth. This perspective is rooted in the idea that mental exercise is essential for maintaining a sharp and agile mind, much like physical exercise is necessary for a healthy body. Engaging in activities like reading and puzzles can improve memory, boost problem-solving skills, and even delay the onset of age-related cognitive decline.On the other hand, others argue that leisure time should be reserved for resting the mind, allowing it to recharge and recuperate from the stresses and demands of daily life. This viewpoint emphasizes the importance of relaxation and downtime in maintaining mental well-being and preventing burnout. Resting the mind can help reduce anxiety, improve mood, and enhance overall quality of life. For instance, taking a break from mentally taxing activities can give individuals the opportunity to recharge and return to their tasks with renewed energy and focus.In my opinion, I believe that striking a balance between mental stimulation and rest is the key to effectively utilizing leisure time. While engaging in mentally stimulating activities can be beneficial, it is equally important to allow the mind time to rest and recover. For example, I often allocate my weekends to reading and learning new skills, but I also make sure to set aside time for relaxation and meditation. By doing so, I find that I am able to maintain a healthy and productive mindset, while also avoiding the risk of mental exhaustion. Ultimately, finding a balance between mental stimulation and rest is crucial for maintaining overall well-being and making the most out of leisure time.
865;Some people think that it is more beneficial to take part in sports which are played in teams, like football, while other people think that taking part in individual sports, like tennis or swimming, is better. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Sport play an essential role in shaping the personality of individual. Some people believe that sports which are played in teams are more beneficial like football, while others think that solo sports like tennis or swimming is better. The following essay will discuss both arguments and give my opinion that sports which are played in teams have more advantages over solo sport activites.First of all, there is no doubt that the individual sport activities enahnce people confidence. It helps building the personality and strentghen the mentality of the individuals. For examole, one role model in my home country was playing tennis table, he mentioned once in an interview, that sport helped him not only to win trophies but it raised his mental strength and shaped his pesonality.However, some people believe that, sports which are played in teamshave more advantages and all community will get the benefits. Soccer, for example, will help the players specifically the young children to understand working together and sharing the responsibility. In addition people will grow with better understanding to the concept of sharing achievements which can improve all the community. For instance, i was a member of soccer team in high school, me and my friends were taught, in order to win games we should put plans together and work as one unit. Furthermore, it helps me later in my career to understand the meaning of leadership and how the sharing responsibility and working together could bring the success to our endeavour.To conclude, solo sport can bring proud and honour to individuals butsports which played in teams teach people the meaning of working together which will improve the community in the future.;The debate surrounding the benefits of participating in team sports versus individual sports has sparked intense discussion. While some individuals believe that team sports, such as football, offer more advantages, others argue that individual sports, like tennis or swimming, are more beneficial. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and provide my own opinion.On the one hand, team sports provide numerous benefits, including the development of social skills, teamwork, and camaraderie. Participating in team sports allows individuals to interact with their peers, fostering a sense of belonging and cooperation. Additionally, team sports often require strategic planning and communication, promoting problem-solving skills and adaptability. For instance, football players must work together to achieve a common goal, which enhances their ability to collaborate and rely on each other.On the other hand, individual sports offer unique benefits, such as improved mental toughness, self-discipline, and time management. Engaging in individual sports, like tennis or swimming, enables athletes to focus solely on their performance, allowing them to set personal goals and track progress. Individual sports also promote self-motivation and accountability, as athletes are solely responsible for their successes and setbacks. For example, a tennis player must develop the mental strength to overcome obstacles and stay focused during a match.In my opinion, both team and individual sports have their advantages, and the choice between them depends on personal preferences and goals. However, I believe that participating in team sports provides a more well-rounded experience, as it combines physical activity with social interaction and teamwork. Ultimately, engaging in any sport, whether team or individual, is beneficial for physical and mental health, and individuals should choose the type of sport that suits them best. By doing so, they can reap the rewards of sports participation, regardless of whether they prefer the camaraderie of team sports or the independence of individual sports.
765;Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children’s development than playing computer games. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Some individuals believe that playing outside has a more positive effect on children's development rather than playing computer games. I share the idea that being involved in outdoor activities is more beneficial than playing computer games.Active development is the main reason for including outdoor activities in children's life. All people know that the development of children is an extremely significant part of building a personality. To do so parents should try to involve their children in exploring local insects, animals or playing different games such as football, riding bicycles, and many other. This will only expand the knowledge of children, and consequently have a positive effect on their development. This is also important to have a healthy generation in the future. Parents can join their children or they can find some friends around and also be socially active. For example, a father can teach his son how to bicycle or how to take care of plants and trees.The next important reason for doing more outdoor activities for children is avoiding physical problems, which can cause computer games. Currently, a lot of people including children suffer from different side effects of a lazy lifestyle and obesity can exemplify it. To avoid problems with physical health in the future, spending a couple of hours should be recommended to all children.Of course, little time spent playing computer games will not hurt children, but it is important to limit it. To sum up, children should do more outdoor activities and play computer games less.;The debate surrounding the benefits of outdoor activities versus playing computer games for children's development has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that computer games have their own set of advantages, I strongly agree that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children's overall development.Outdoor activities, such as sports, playing in parks, or simply exploring nature, offer a wide range of benefits that are essential for a child's physical, mental, and social growth. Physically, outdoor activities help children develop motor skills, balance, and coordination, while also promoting a healthy lifestyle by burning calories and maintaining fitness. Moreover, being outdoors exposes children to sunlight, which is crucial for vitamin D production, essential for bone health.Beyond physical benefits, outdoor activities also play a significant role in mental and social development. Being in nature has been shown to reduce stress levels and improve mood, contributing to better mental health. Socially, outdoor activities often involve interacting with other children, teaching valuable lessons about teamwork, communication, and friendship. These social skills are indispensable for building strong, lasting relationships and succeeding in future careers.In contrast, while computer games can enhance problem-solving skills, strategy, and quick thinking, they often lack the holistic benefits provided by outdoor activities. Excessive gaming can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, contributing to obesity and other health issues. Furthermore, the social interactions in online gaming communities can sometimes be negative, exposing children to bullying or inappropriate content.In conclusion, while computer games have their advantages, the comprehensive benefits of outdoor activities for children's physical, mental, and social development cannot be overlooked. Encouraging children to participate in outdoor activities should be a priority for parents and educators, ensuring they grow into well-rounded, healthy individuals equipped with the skills necessary to thrive in all aspects of life.
613;Some people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;It is often argued out there about sports, debating about both physcial and mental strengths and which is far more crucial to the success. This essay will go over these two points of view in further depth and outline some expamples, where relevant, for each.On one side, some people think that the most important factor to succeeding in sports is the physical strength. Body strength is actually quite indispensable in any sport activity, especially those types of sports that demand a high fitness level and high physical endurance, etc, such as MMA fights, wrestling, football, and so on. All of these require an elevated and advanced charachterestics of one's body. For example, an athlete can not keep up a football match and running around for 90 minutes without a high body endurance, fitness, so on and so forth.On the other hand, the others believe that a powerful mentality and mindset are needed for such success and accomplishment. That is, they believe that one's attitude is the first key to success before anything else. People need to have some sort of a mindset with specific qualities, such as perseverance, determination, concentration, etc. and it's not always about havign a massive body strength. For example, some MMA athletes step in the ring with solid bodies, will not always win the games if they're not determined and persistent already, altought their opponents do not have that huge bodies. It's all about the mindset.In conclusion, it's not easy to decide which of these two criteria is more important than the other. However, I believe that any athlete must have these two, train them both before getting into any challenge, no matter what type of activity. An athlete must have a strong body and a trained attitude once and for all.;The debate surrounding the importance of physical versus mental strength in achieving success in sports has been ongoing. While some argue that physical strength is the key to success,,_REF others believe that mental strength plays a more crucial role. In this essay, we will discuss both views and provide an opinion on the matter.On the one hand, physical strength is undoubtedly essential for success in sports. A strong and healthy body enables athletes to perform at their best, withstand the physical demands of their sport, and recover quickly from injuries. For instance, sports like football, rugby, and boxing require a high level of physical strength and endurance. Athletes who possess physical strength are more likely to excel in these sports and gain a competitive edge over their opponents.On the other hand, mental strength is equally, if not more, important for success in sports. Mental toughness enables athletes to overcome obstacles, stay focused under pressure, and maintain a positive mindset even in the face of adversity. Many successful athletes, such as tennis player Novak Djokovic and golfer Tiger Woods, attribute their success to their mental strength and ability to stay focused and motivated. Mental strength also plays a crucial role in teamwork, strategy, and decision-making, all of which are essential components of most sports.In my opinion, mental strength is more important than physical strength for achieving success in sports. While physical strength provides a foundation for athletic performance, mental strength is what sets apart champion athletes from others. Mental strength enables athletes to push themselves beyond their physical limits, overcome fear and anxiety, and maintain a high level of performance even when faced with adversity. In conclusion, both physical and mental strength are essential for success in sports, but mental strength provides the edge that separates good athletes from great ones.
1349;Some people think that public health in a country can be improved by government making laws regarding nutritious food (agree/disagree).;Some people think that public health within a country can be improved by government making laws regarding nutritious food. Others, however, think that health is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Personal and public health are tightly related to food choices. While some people believe that the government should regulate nutrition to improve public wellness, others argue that it should be people’s decision whether to pursue a healthy diet or not. This essay will discuss both points of view and explain why the authorities should not control the types of food people can buy.Legislators could impose laws concerning nutritious food in an effort to have a healthier population, public health costs. Even if this could be considered a good idea, it would be very quite difficult to implement. To achieve this target, the rulers could impose a levy on unhealthy food options, or reduce their availability on the grocery stores shelves. In Italy, for example, products such as carbonated sugary drinks and chips are heavily taxed. As a result, the sales of these items have decreased. However, if the authorities start to take control of what their citizens can or cannot eat, it may be seen as limitation of freedom.Since personal freedom is an extremely important human right, many people think that they should be responsible for their choices regarding the food and drinks they decide to consume. I agree with this opinion because limiting nutritional options, even if it is done with the best outcome in mind, could consequently create dissatisfaction among the population, which would possibly lead to other public issues such as protests and demonstrations. A better approach could be educating the public about a healthy diet, which would help people make better-informed decisions about the food they consume. Many developed countries around the world employed this strategy and saw public health gains.In conclusion, even though the government is able to control the dietary habits of its population through taxation and restrictions, healthier citizens and reduced public health expenses isn’t the only possible outcome. Limiting personal freedom could result in social unrest and for that reason diet decisions are better to be left up to well-informed individuals.This response achieved the task requirements by discussing whether the government or individuals should be in control of their diet. The ideas are developed and supported by examples, the information is organised in paragraphs, and coherence is maintained throughout the essay. A range of sentences structures and advanced vocabulary is used in this work. Overall, it seems worthy of IELTS Band 8+.;The issue of whether government laws regarding nutritious food can improve public health in a country is a contentious one. In my opinion, I agree that such laws can have a positive impact on public health. One of the primary reasons for this is that government regulations can limit the production and sale of unhealthy foods. For instance, laws can be enacted to restrict the amount of sugar and salt that can be added to food products, or to limit the sale of foods high in saturated fats. By doing so, the government can encourage food manufacturers to produce healthier options, thereby increasing the availability of nutritious food for the general public.Another reason why government laws can improve public health is that they can promote education and awareness about healthy eating. Laws can be passed to make food labeling more transparent, allowing consumers to make informed decisions about their diet. Additionally,eduation campaigns can be launched to teach people about the importance of a balanced diet and the risks associated with consuming unhealthy foods. However, some may argue that such laws can be overly restrictive and infringe upon personal freedoms. Nevertheless, the benefits of improving public health outweigh the potential drawbacks. A healthier population can lead to reduced healthcare costs, increased productivity, and a better quality of life. In conclusion, laws regarding nutritious food can be an effective way for governments to improve public health in their country. By promoting healthy eating habits and increasing access to nutritious food, governments can take a significant step towards creating a healthier and more sustainable society.
1386;Some people think that students who don’t take a break in studies between the high school and the university are at disadvantage compared to students who travel and work after high school before further continuing their education. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, in our competitive world, to succeed, knowledge from school and university is not enough. Therefore, students who study from the school to university get fewer benefits and contribute less too, compared to those who travel or work and get experience and skills . There are two following reasons to support for my opinion. I refer to the group of people who study from school to university as ‘group A’ and the other group – as ‘group B’.Firstly, at school and university, what group A gains is almost entirely theory, theory and theory. Of course, theory is very , however, you can’t do everything with just theory. You must have experience. This is what group A . Although in the third or fourth year at university, group A can be apprentices in some companies, to help them approach their future jobs, they aren’t trained well because of the short time spent working. And the real job is still very strange to them. After graduating, without experience, group A students can’t accomplish their work perfectly. On the other hand, it takes them time and money to keep up with other experienced students and they may be scorned. Therefore, group A students can contribute less than group B who have the two most important things: skills and experience.Secondly, as group A students are contributing less, they surely get less benefit. Moreover, many companies which employ people in group A have to train them from ground-up. These companies take this cost from group A’s salary to reduce the risk of their employees leaving to other companies after being trained. So, less benefits are unavoidable and certain, group B members are more loyal and effective workers. They also have useful experience and skills. Besides, their education is the same as or even higher than that of group A. As the result, group B gets more benefits absolutely.In conclusion, I think a student should travel or work before going to the university. That way, not only will they have basic knowledge but also skills and experience which are useful for them to get a good job and have a brilliant future.;The decision to take a break between high school and university has sparked a heated debate among students and educators. While some believe that diving straight into university studies is the best approach, others argue that taking a gap year to travel and work can be beneficial. In my opinion, I agree that students who don't take a break in studies are at a disadvantage compared to those who do.Taking a gap year allows students to gain valuable life experiences, develop new skills, and broaden their perspectives. By traveling and working, they can discover their passions, build confidence, and learn to be independent. This break from academics can also help students recharge and refocus, leading to improved motivation and academic performance when they eventually enroll in university. Moreover, students who take a gap year often develop important soft skills such as time management, teamwork, and problem-solving, which are highly valued by employers.On the other hand, students who transition directly from high school to university may experience burnout and struggle to cope with the academic demands. They may also lack the maturity and self-awareness that comes from taking a break, which can lead to poor decision-making and a higher risk of dropping out. Furthermore, the intense academic pressure can stifle their creativity and limit their opportunities for personal growth.In conclusion, I firmly believe that taking a break between high school and university can be a wise decision. It provides students with a unique opportunity to explore their interests, develop important life skills, and gain a competitive edge in the job market. While it may seem counterintuitive, taking a gap year can ultimately lead to greater academic success and personal fulfillment.
1281;Some people think that the most important thing about being rich is it gives a person the opportunity to help other people.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Helping other people in society is noble goal ,to some people it's a big achievement .However rebuilding personality of individuals and giving them an opportunity to leave an influence in the community is reflecting the genuien humanity .Therefore i agree with notion that rich people who are, in fact have the ability to offer the help for orthers in order to recreate healthy environment for everbody to work in our society .The following essay will illuminate the reason behind my opinion .Regrettably . many people suffer form disadvantages situtaions nowdays like losing jobs or money ,they find themselves have no energy or motive to contiune and to help their families . As a result of that poverty propagates in some society and usually accompany with low level availability of education . Hence to avoid falling into misery, some countries nowdays help non governmenrtal organizations and institutions to give assist to poor communities in a manner to raise education and develop health sector. For instance , Red Cross and Save the children , both organizations offere help and leverage human rebuild personality which no doubt will enrich these communities with several benefits .In spite of green vevet picture that mentioned above , some people think that helping people alone is not enough . However , others believe that no matter how grim or daunting things may seem , if the individual have the courage to move a head , then everything is possible . Nevertheless people can find the motive inside eventhoughlife handed them a toughest time . For example Helen Keller .An American Author , although she born with disability but she could be one of greatest authors in western history .In summary , no doubt that people should have the courage to move a head whether they find help from others or not . However people who can offer the help will make our community live peacefully and bring prosperity to our offsprings .;The notion that being rich is primarily significant because it provides an opportunity to help others is a perspective that resonates with many. I agree with this statement, as wealth can indeed serve as a powerful tool for making a positive impact on the lives of others.One of the primary reasons wealth can be instrumental in helping others is through philanthropy. Rich individuals have the financial capacity to donate to charitable causes, support educational institutions, and fund medical research. For instance, billionaires like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett have pledged a significant portion of their wealth to philanthropic efforts, aiming to eradicate diseases, improve education, and alleviate poverty. Their contributions exemplify how wealth can be a potent force for good.Moreover, wealth can provide the means to create jobs and stimulate economic growth in underprivileged communities. By investing in businesses and startups, wealthy individuals can generate employment opportunities, thereby empowering people to improve their socio-economic status. This, in turn, can lead to a ripple effect of prosperity and stability in communities that need it most.However, it's also important to acknowledge that the desire to help others is not exclusive to the wealthy. People from all walks of life contribute to their communities in meaningful ways, often through volunteer work, community service, or simply by being supportive neighbors and friends. Nonetheless, the scale and impact of the assistance that can be provided by those with substantial financial resources are uniquely significant.In conclusion, the opportunity to help others is indeed a crucial aspect of being rich. Through philanthropy, job creation, and economic stimulation, wealth can be a powerful catalyst for positive change in the world. While helping others is not the sole domain of the rich, the capacity to make a significant difference on a large scale is undoubtedly enhanced by financial wealth.
1081;Some people think that there should be strict laws to control the amount of noise a person makes because of the disturbance it causes to people.Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;With the increasing population in cities,noise pollution has been one of the important causes of concern.This essay presents the advantages and disadvantages of the strict laws that are made to control noise pollution.Noise pollution affects different groups of people in various ways.The increasing noise in recent days has led to increasing problems of hearing impairment in people in today's society.Also,the noise pollution has a devastating affects on the heart patients and it has been affecting people who are working and studying in various ways.By implementing strict rules like imposing heavy fines on vehicles honking unnecessarily and filing a case on the noise caused by the public gatherings like rallies,the above problems can be addressed.For example, recent studies have shown that the cities having less noise pollution have been leading better life when compared to those with noise pollution.However,implementing strict laws on noise caused by a person also has some disadvantages.Firstly,different religions have different kinds of festivals which cause a lot of noise.For instance,diwali,one of the most celebrated festivals in India,is celebrated by firing crackers causing a lot of noise is affected by implementing these laws.Secondly,most of the people with religious beliefs will have a bad impact by these rules.To give an example,the prayers in masjids are made with loud noise so that it can reach a large group of people living in the area.To conclude,implemeting strict rules like fines and filing a case on the people causing noise pollution have a good impact on the health of the society and increasing the efficiency of work where as the festivals and the religious centres have a negative impact by these laws.;"The notion of implementing strict laws to control noise levels has sparked a heated debate. Proponents of this idea argue that excessive noise can be a significant disturbance to others, particularly in residential areas. On the one hand, strict noise laws can have several advantages. For instance, they can help maintain a peaceful environment, which is essential for people's mental and physical well-being. Moreover, such laws can also protect people from noise pollution caused by loud music, construction, or traffic, which can lead to health problems such as hearing loss and stress.On the other hand, there are also some disadvantages to consider. Overly restrictive noise laws can infringe upon individual freedom and creativity. For example, musicians or music schools may be forced to limit their practice sessions or cancel outdoor performances, which can stifle artistic expression. Additionally, strict noise laws can also be difficult to enforce, as what constitutes ""excessive noise"" can be subjective and vary from person to person. This could lead to unnecessary conflicts between neighbors or with law enforcement.In my opinion, a balanced approach is needed. While it is essential to maintain a peaceful environment, it is also crucial to allow for reasonable freedom of expression and creativity. For instance, designating specific quiet hours or establishing noise-free zones can be a more effective and practical solution. Ultimately, finding a middle ground that takes into account the needs and rights of all individuals is key to addressing the issue of noise disturbance. By doing so, we can promote a more harmonious and respectful community."
1431;Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than with a teacher. Others think that it is always better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.;It is certainly said that learning is an ongoing process .Every person something new their age, experience, knowledge and education. According to my point of view it is always better to have teacher or guide for study.One teacher has adequate knowledge to teach their student. knows ways to make subject easier for the students, moreover, he teaches them in an effective manner. For example, some students are weak in some subjects but a teacher them according to their mental capacity. . Some people can learn better in the topics with others. In class people can the views of others, . .In the today’s competitive world, everybody is busy, some people think that their time classes they can learn better their subject . They can attend online classes by using the Internet at home. They can get relevant information from the Internet regarding their topic. There is specific time or age limit to learn something new. Some new things we can only learn from experience – for example new facts, new habits and so on., I would like to say that it is always better for the people to have a teacher because a teacher has good knowledge, experience and is educated how to teach others. People will learn from a teacher in an easier way rather than on their own.;The debate over whether individuals can learn more effectively with or without a teacher has sparked intense discussion. While some people believe that self-study is the most efficient way to acquire knowledge, others argue that having a teacher is essential for optimal learning. In my opinion, I prefer learning with a teacher, and for good reason.First and foremost, a teacher provides personalized guidance and feedback, which is crucial for correcting mistakes and improving understanding. When learning alone, it can be difficult to identify and rectify errors, leading to the reinforcement of bad habits and misconceptions. A teacher, on the other hand, can offer timely interventions, ensuring that students stay on the right track. Additionally, teachers can tailor their instruction to meet the unique needs and learning styles of their students, resulting in a more effective learning experience.Another significant advantage of learning with a teacher is the opportunity for interactive and engaging instruction. Teachers can create a dynamic learning environment that incorporates discussions, debates, and hands-on activities, making complex concepts more accessible and enjoyable. This social aspect of learning also fosters critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills, all of which are essential for academic and professional success.In contrast, self-study can be a solitary and isolating experience, lacking the motivational and emotional support that a teacher can provide. Without a teacher, students may struggle to stay motivated and focused, leading to procrastination and decreased productivity. Furthermore, teachers can provide valuable recommendations for further learning, helping students to explore new interests and deepen their understanding of a subject.In conclusion, while self-study has its advantages, I firmly believe that learning with a teacher is the more effective approach. The personalized guidance, interactive instruction, and emotional support that a teacher offers make for a more engaging, efficient, and enjoyable learning experience. Ultimately, the benefits of having a teacher far outweigh the benefits of self-study, making it the preferred choice for optimal learning.
693;Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Space, so unknown for the humankind that it generates so much curiosity among experts and enterprenues. Due to this curiosity, the amount of resources and money invested in its exploration is surprisingly big. Developing technology for it is expensive but, in my humble opinion, completly justified.Firstly, developing technology is vital so that space exploration can be carried out succesfully. Experts have discovered that we only know a 4 percent of the entire universe. If with only that 4 percent we have accomplished amazing achievements, imagine what the human race could do when knowing a 10 percent.Secondly, space exploration and the technology involve on it not only will help the human race understand the universe but also will provide a whole new kind of tourism, space tourism. The CEOs of some of the most profitable business in America are investigating this possibility. The leading enterprises in this sector are Blue Origin from Jeff Bezos and Space X from Elon Musk. When discovered the way of sending people to space safely, space tourism will generate twice the money spent on technology for space exploration.In a nutshell, space exploration is crutial for the development of the human race. Furthermore, if this was not enough, all the technology developed will serve the purpose of creating a whole new kind of tourism that will generate billions of dollars in revenue. From my point of view, even though here on earth there are several problems to be solve with money, our future lies on space, so be must spend as much money as possible.;The allocation of funds towards space exploration has been a topic of debate for many years. While some argue that the money spent on developing technology for space exploration is not justified, I partially disagree with this statement. On one hand, it is true that there are more pressing issues on Earth that require significant funding, such as poverty, hunger, and disease. The amount of money spent on space exploration could be used to address these problems, which would have a more immediate and tangible impact on human lives.On the other hand, I believe that the benefits of space exploration far outweigh the costs. Space research has led to numerous breakthroughs and innovations that have improved our daily lives, such as GPS technology, telecommunications, and medical advancements. Moreover, space exploration has the potential to unlock new resources, such as minerals and energy sources, which could have a significant impact on the global economy. Furthermore, space exploration can also help us to better understand the universe and our place in it, which can lead to new scientific discoveries and a deeper understanding of the cosmos.In addition, the technological advancements made through space exploration can also be applied to solve problems on Earth, such as climate change and sustainable development. For example, satellite technology can be used to monitor climate patterns and track natural disasters, while space-based solar power can provide a clean and sustainable source of energy. In conclusion, while I agree that there are more pressing issues on Earth that require funding, I believe that the benefits of space exploration justify the money spent on it. By continuing to invest in space research, we can unlock new technologies, resources, and scientific discoveries that can have a significant impact on human lives and the planet as a whole.
1309;Some people today believe that it is acceptable to use physical force to discipline children, but others feel it is completely unacceptable.Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Punishing children with physical force, or corporal punishment as it is also called, is something that was accepted not so long ago and people over the age of forty may well remember it. Nowadays, however, corporal punishment is against the law in most countries and adults who practise it can be taken to court. Children are always a vulnerable group and they depend on adults for protection and education. Of course, part of the growing up process is testing and breaking boundaries and it is nearly always necessary to instill discipline on a child. Whether or not it is necessary to use physical force to do so can be a very emotive subject.Supporters of corporal punishment often defend their standpoint by explaining that the corporal punishment is not, or should not be, excessive. They do not argue that a child should be beaten severely until he or she is bruised or cut. They argue that just the infliction of mild pain causes effective discipline and also the fear that it might be applied. People who grew up experiencing it might offer this point of view.Those who oppose using physical force on a child would say that the vulnerability and innocence of a child means that force should never be used. Children need to trust adults and believe that no harm will come to them. Additionally, children learn from adults and it is argued that corporal punishment will only teach children that force is an answer to various problems. It is also claimed that corporal punishment has no added benefits over other forms of discipline that do not require physical force. Using it can cause psychological harm to children and should be classed as child abuse.Personally, I do not believe that limited use of forms of corporal punishment can cause harm, and a parent who administers a mild form of it to his or her child should not be subject to criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, I would not use it myself. I can also recognise the possibilities of adults who are not a child’s parents misusing corporal punishment. Therefore, I believe that on balance physical force to discipline children should not be permitted.;The use of physical force to discipline children is a highly debated topic, with some people believing it is an acceptable means of punishment, while others strongly disagree. In my opinion, physical force is completely unacceptable as a means of discipline, and I will outline the reasons for this stance.Firstly, physical force can lead to physical and emotional harm to the child. Research has shown that children who are subjected to physical punishment are more likely to experience anxiety, depression, and aggression. For instance, a child who is spanked may develop a fear of their parent, leading to a breakdown in their relationship and a lack of trust. Furthermore, physical force can also lead to a cycle of violence, where children may grow up to use physical force themselves as a means of resolving conflicts.Secondly, physical force is not an effective means of discipline in the long term. While it may stop a child's misbehavior in the short term, it does not teach them why their behavior was wrong or how to make better choices in the future. In contrast, positive reinforcement and explaining the reasons behind rules can help children develop self-regulation skills and make better decisions.Lastly, there are alternative and more effective methods of discipline that do not involve physical force. For example, time-outs, removal of privileges, and positive reinforcement can be used to teach children about boundaries and consequences without causing harm. In many countries, such as Sweden, physical punishment of children is illegal, and parents are encouraged to use alternative methods of discipline, resulting in a reduction in child abuse cases.In conclusion, while some people may believe that physical force is an acceptable means of discipline, I strongly disagree. The use of physical force can lead to physical and emotional harm, is not effective in the long term, and can be replaced with alternative methods of discipline. As a society, we should prioritize the well-being and safety of children and promote positive and non-violent means of discipline.
1358;Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems, is this a positive or negative development?;Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems. Is it a positive or negative development? Give your own opinion and examples from your experience.At present, the Internet plays a vital role in almost every aspect of human life. As a result, individuals are searching online reasonable solutions to their illnesses. Not everyone is convinced that access to such information online is safe and helpful. However, in my view, providing the general public with access to trustworthy information about medical disorders would invariably improve the quality of the medical care for the whole society.Nowadays, even though there are plenty of online platforms developed for medical education, most of the sites have not been written by professional healthcare providers. Hence, there is a high possibility of spreading wrong medical information throughout the world, unless the site developers are held accountable for the content they provide. If patients receive incorrect information about a medical procedure and follow the wrong advice, for instance, to remove a wart at home, it might lead to a serious infection, excessive bleeding or another medical emergency. That would constitute a negative effect of using online knowledge for medical treatments at home rather than visiting a professional.On the flip side, the Internet, the society is well aware of most common medical disorders and preventive measures. Consequently, a reasonable and prudent individual can decide whether to get professional opinion on one’s disease or to handle it at home, that they get reliable online medical information. Moreover, if patients can manage mild medical problems themselves, it would certainly reduce the workload at the local hospitals, freeing more doctors for patients in real need. Besides, if patients come with a certain extent of knowledge about their condition to the medical consultation, it would invariably be helpful to the medical practitioner for effective decision making.To sum up, it is evident that online search for information on medical disorders can be a positive development as long as the general public receives trustworthy information.This response addresses the topic well. The writer’s position is clearly explained and supported, the information is organised in paragraphs in an easy to follow way, and use of linking words is appropriate. A range of complex sentence forms is used and there are very few errors in word choice or word formation (underlined in blue). Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.;The advent of the Internet has revolutionized the way people access information, including medical knowledge. Many individuals now use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems, a development that has both positive and negative aspects. On the positive side, the Internet provides unparalleled access to a vast array of medical information, enabling patients to take a more proactive role in their healthcare. This empowers them to make informed decisions about their treatment options and to better understand their conditions. Additionally, online resources can facilitate communication between patients and healthcare professionals, improving the quality of care.However, there are also significant drawbacks to relying on the Internet for medical solutions. One of the primary concerns is the credibility and accuracy of online medical information. The Internet is plagued by misinformation, and without proper medical training, it can be challenging for individuals to discern reliable sources from misleading ones. This can lead to misdiagnosis or inappropriate self-treatment, potentially exacerbating health issues. Furthermore, online diagnosis and treatment can never fully replace the nuanced, personalized care provided by healthcare professionals, who consider a patient's complete medical history, perform physical examinations, and interpret diagnostic tests.In conclusion, while the Internet can be a valuable tool for researching medical problems, its use as a primary source for solutions is a double-edged sword. It offers empowerment and access to information but also poses risks of misinformation and inappropriate self-management of health issues. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals to use the Internet judiciously, consulting healthcare professionals to validate any information found online and to ensure that their health decisions are well-informed and safe. By doing so, the benefits of Internet-based medical research can be maximized while minimizing its pitfalls.
949;Some say that because many people are living much longer, the age at which people retire from work should be raised considerably.To what extent do you agree or disagree?;People nowadays are living much longer.With the discovering of new medicine and with the innovation in the medical field, the life expectancy of a person skyrocketed over the last decade.Some people might think that the consequence of this phenomenon should be the fact that the age at which people retire from work ought to be raised considerably.I don't agree with this idea.Rather than involving the life expectancy of a person, we should consider the job itself.Is it tiring? Does it require a person to be able to react immediately to a potential problem?If the job is tiring I think that it would be better for a person to retire. If you end up being worn out every day because your job is very exhausting the life expectancy should not be the fact that decides if you have or not the right to retire.The question ought to be: Is the person physically and mentally able to cope with the work?The older you get the slower you become. This is another pivotal factor that should be taken into account when deciding the retirement age of a person.The ability to react to dangerous events keeps the working environment under control.Let's imagine a carpenter working on the construction of a new building.What if a wall suddenly falls? Does an elderly person react faster than a younger worker?I am an optimistic person but I would stick to my guns in this scenario betting on the younger person.I would like to wrap up this essay by saying that I could have thought of many more reasons that explain why the age at which people retire from work should not be based entirely on the fact that people are living longer.Of course, this can not be ignored but basing this decision only on this fact it is seen by me as a poor approach.;The notion that the retirement age should be raised considerably due to the increasing human lifespan has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that this is a necessary measure to ensure the sustainability of pension systems, others claim that it would be unfair to force people to work longer. In my opinion, I partially agree that the retirement age should be raised, but with certain considerations.On the one hand, raising the retirement age can help mitigate the burden on pension systems and social security funds. As people live longer, they require more years of financial support, which can be a significant strain on the economy. By increasing the retirement age, the number of years that individuals receive pension benefits can be reduced, thereby alleviating some of the financial pressure. Additionally, older workers can continue to contribute their valuable experience and skills to the workforce, which can be beneficial for businesses and the economy as a whole.On the other hand, I disagree that the retirement age should be raised considerably for all individuals. Certain occupations, such as those in physically demanding or high-stress industries, may not be suitable for older workers. Moreover, some people may have health issues or caregiving responsibilities that prevent them from working beyond a certain age. Therefore, a blanket increase in the retirement age may not be fair or practical for all individuals.In conclusion, while I agree that the retirement age may need to be adjusted to reflect the increasing human lifespan, I believe that this should be done on a case-by-case basis, taking into account individual circumstances and occupational requirements. A more flexible approach to retirement, allowing individuals to choose when to retire based on their health, financial situation, and personal goals, would be a more equitable solution.
1389;Some say that the Internet is making the world smaller by bringing people together. To what extent do to you agree that the Internet is making it easier for people to communicate with one another?;"A global village, that is certainly what the world feels like nowadays. With the help of the , you can reach out and get to know people you might never have met in person. Articles can be co-authored, business deals can be finalized, degrees can be earned and at times even medical advice can be given- and all of this is just a click away.Electronic mail, instant messages, web cameras and microphones; all these gadgets and programs make the presence of the other person more real. Who knows; with the help of visual reality you might even get a 3-D image of the speaker! I believe that the Internet is one the best inventions of the last century, you can hardly get to miss anyone and nobody is really out of reach. You can keep in touch with your friends, and be able to do your work from your bedroom in your pajamas!However, the internet can also be a major source of harassment. Spammers and hackers can invade your privacy and get personal/confidential information, which otherwise they never get access to. You are never out of anybody’s reach, unless you make a conscious decision of not checking your email, there can be always more work waiting for you in your inbox and you might never have a moment to yourself. Worse yet, if you were a workaholic, you might never experience that stress-free vacation ever again in your life – simply, because you have your mobile workplace with you at all times.As a romantic, I will always look forward to getting an occasional letter in the snail mail. A personal letter, where I can sense the mood of the writer by the slants in his/her handwriting and get to know him/her better. But as a type A personality person, the internet gives me all what I dream of in terms of communication – the speed, reliability, and convenience of time and place. I can certainly tolerate its shortcomings any day, as long as it keeps me close to my loved ones.";The advent of the Internet has revolutionized the way people communicate with one another. In my opinion, I strongly agree that the Internet is making it easier for people to communicate, thereby making the world smaller. The Internet has bridged geographical gaps, enabling people from diverse backgrounds and locations to connect and interact seamlessly.With the rise of social media platforms, as well as video conferencing tools, individuals can now communicate with others across the globe in real-time. This has facilitated global connections, fostering friendships, collaborations, and business relationships that transcend borders. Moreover, the Internet has also enabled people to share ideas, cultures, and experiences, promoting cross-cultural understanding and exchange.Furthermore, the Internet has made communication more convenient and accessible. With just a few clicks, people can send emails, messages, or make voice and video calls, eliminating the need for traditional mail or phone calls. This has been particularly beneficial for people with mobility issues or those living in remote areas, who can now connect with others without having to physically travel.However, it is also important to acknowledge that the Internet can also create a false sense of connection, where people substitute online interactions for in-person relationships. Nevertheless, the benefits of the Internet in facilitating global communication far outweigh the drawbacks. In conclusion, the Internet has undoubtedly made it easier for people to communicate with one another, bringing the world closer together. As the Internet continues to evolve, it is likely that its role in fostering global connections and communication will only continue to grow. Ultimately, the Internet has transformed the way we interact, and its impact on making the world smaller is undeniable.
655;Some systems require students to specialize in a limited range of subjects from the age of fifteen. Other systems require students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?;"Education programs are different from one area to another area, there are systems that learners are required to choose restricted number of courses for their academic curriculum by the age of 15.while,other educational systems ask students to take comprehensive courses until they graduate from school. There are many positives for both trends, in my opinion limited range of academic subjects education system is better.On the one hand, it is basic knowledge to accept the idea that pupils who study selected number of subjects from age of fifteen are more informative academically in specified field of study. For example, when student decide to take medical subjects from early age the student will be prepared by tutors completely for the nominated curriculum,as a result all the student's focus will be on medical topics thus, the student is more qualified to practice medicine more efficiently after school graduation.Furthermore, this system will build a solid knowledge background in limited range of subjects can help to develop creativity at early age.Moreover, in the financial view point it may be better for students to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15; selected number of academic subjects means less money allocated for educational services by guardians.On the other hand, it is true to claim that general subjects system can prepare students to be more informative in various different live aspects. Since, students who register with wide range subjects system can gain academic knowledge and support in fields such as mathematics,physics,medicine,and....ect. Therefore,those students can select more than one speciality to practice as a professionalism in future.Besides, wide range system help to improve social interactions better,because friends will not be separated and they continue school education together until graduation,inaddition there is chance to make more friends as primises are more crowded.To sum up, educational systems main target is to develop and progress academic background of students.But, in my opinion,it is better to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15 due to reasons like: solid academic background in specific field,creativity,and less financial burden on parents.";The debate over the ideal education system has sparked intense discussion among educators and policymakers. Two predominant systems exist: one that requires students to specialize in a limited range of subjects from a young age, typically fifteen, and another that mandates a broad-based curriculum until students leave school. Both systems have their benefits, and the choice between them depends on the goals and values of the education system.The specialization system allows students to delve deeper into their chosen subjects, enabling them to develop expertise and a strong foundation for future academic or professional pursuits. This approach is beneficial for students who have a clear idea of their career goals and can focus on developing the necessary skills. Moreover, it can lead to more efficient use of resources, as students are not required to study subjects that may not be relevant to their future.On the other hand, the broad-based system provides students with a comprehensive education, exposing them to a wide range of subjects and fostering a more holistic understanding of the world. This approach encourages students to explore different fields, develop critical thinking, and cultivate problem-solving skills. It also allows students to discover their strengths and interests, which may not be immediately apparent.Ultimately, the better system depends on the individual student's needs and the society's values. A balance between specialization and broad-based education may be the most effective approach, allowing students to explore various subjects while also permitting them to specialize in areas of interest. By incorporating elements of both systems, educators can provide students with a well-rounded education that prepares them for an ever-changing world.
1347;Some think that children should leave their family home as soon as possible while others believe they should stay for as long as they like (discuss);Some people think that it is best to encourage children to leave their family home as soon as possible. Others believe children should stay at the family home for as long as they like. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayAlthough it is thought by some that urging young people to abandon their family home at an early age is beneficial for them, others believe that it is better if children stay with their families for longer. In my opinion, leaving family home early has many advantages for children.On the one people think that youngsters ought to leave their parents’ house so as to learn life skills at an early age. Their reasoning is that it should push young people towards independence and make them learn from life lessons rather than merely rely on their parents. For example, students who pursue tertiary study away from their home city might learn taking personal responsibility. Also, living independently will teach children a lot by presenting some difficulties, which, consequently, will add some more experience that may prove essential in their future lives.On the other hand, it is argued that children should stay with their parents for longer for several reasons. Firstly, young people need advice from adults, and no one would be better suited to that than their parents. Secondly, life can be generally harsh, for children in particular. In other words, they might or take unnecessary risks if they mix with the wrong crowd. It is commonly known that young people tend to be by unethical people. To avoid that, being under parental supervision is utterly important for children.To sum up, while people’s opinions may vary, I believe that young people should leave their family home at an early age, while parents ought to provide them with appropriate advice and keep an eye on their well-being.This essay covers the task by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of leaving the family home early in life, and the writer’s opinion has been clearly stated. The arguments for and against have been organised in paragraphs and supported by examples. Accuracy of expression needs some work (see suggested corrections underlined in blue) and in one case sentence structure needs more attention. Overall, assuming the errors were corrected, this essay could score Band 8 in IELTS.;The question of when children should leave their family home has sparked a heated debate among people. While some argue that children should leave their family home as soon as possible, others believe that they should stay for as long as they like. In this essay, I will discuss both perspectives and provide my insights on the matter.On the one hand, leaving the family home at a young age can have numerous benefits for children. It can foster independence, self-reliance, and responsibility, essential skills for adulthood. By living away from their parents, children can learn to manage their finances, cook, and clean, which can help them become more confident and self-sufficient individuals. Additionally, leaving the family home can provide children with the opportunity to explore their interests, make new friends, and develop their own identity.On the other hand, staying with their family for as long as they like can provide children with a sense of security, comfort, and support. Living with their parents can offer children emotional stability, financial assistance, and guidance, which can be particularly important during times of uncertainty or crisis. Moreover, parents can continue to play an active role in their children's lives, offering advice, encouragement, and love, which can help them navigate the challenges of growing up.However, I believe that the decision of when to leave the family home should be based on individual circumstances and personal readiness. Some children may be ready to leave home at the age of 18, while others may need more time to mature and develop essential life skills. Ultimately, parents and children should have an open and honest discussion about their expectations, needs, and goals, and come to a mutual decision that suits everyone's best interests. By doing so, children can transition smoothly into independent adulthood, while maintaining a strong and loving relationship with their family.
1333;Some think that young people should be free to choose any career they like, while others say that they should think more realistically about their future. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;"Choosing a future career requires careful consideration. While some people claim that adolescents should be able to pursue a career they would enjoy, others oppose to that, arguing that teenagers should aim for a high-paying job in order to secure a livelihood when they grow up. Given that our life consists of more than just physiological needs, I strongly believe that it is vital to fulfill one’s potential in the career fields that are most compatible with their interests.The youth who choose highly skilled jobs may find it easier to have a fruitful future in a materialistic sense. It is true that some professions, such as engineers or doctors, are well paid and offer more stability compared to work in other, non-professional fields. For example, psychologists usually have higher starting salaries compared to artists; they also rarely lose their jobs in recessions. People who prioritise earning a living might agree that a reliable job is a must for their future and by no means will they take risks to gain employment in a field they are passionate about, that doesn’t pay well.However, it is worth remembering that we are living in a rapidly changing world and the concept of a ‘guaranteed future’ is unrealistic. Even the smartest of us aren’t prophets and it is impossible to foresee many changes in job markets in the future; some high-salaried jobs of today may no longer exist by the time our young people become adults. Therefore, people may choose to pursue their dreams and follow career paths according to their passions and interests now, to avoid having regrets later in life.Having considered the reasons to prefer monetary remuneration over one’s interests, I am convinced that it would be a pity for youths to limit their career choices to highly paid jobs of today. Unforeseen changes in the jobs markets may affect salaries but won’t change the pleasure one derives from doing something they love.";The debate surrounding the choice of career for young people has sparked a heated discussion.

Furthermore, some careers may be more in demand than others, and choosing a career that is in high demand can provide young people with better job prospects and a sense of security.In my opinion, while it is essential to consider practical aspects, I believe that young people should be free to choose any career they like. Passion and interest are key drivers of success, and pursuing a career that one loves can lead to a more fulfilling and purposeful life. However, it is also important for young people to be aware of the realities of their chosen career path and to make informed decisions. Ultimately, a balance between personal passion and practical considerations is necessary to ensure that young people make career choices that are both satisfying and sustainable.
1403;Students from rural areas often find it difficult to access university education. Some people think that it should become easier for them to study at universities. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Nowadays, it is acknowledged that students from suburban areas find it tough to receive higher education. Whether it should be made easier for them to access university education becomes an ongoing concern, which incurs a highly-charged debate.Obviously, higher education opportunities bring about benefits to students in multiple ways. For example, higher education becomes increasingly important to senior high school graduates, partly it determines if they have the competitive edge in the job market, and partly because it is seen as a guarantee of a certain level of the mental ability, from the computer literacy that is required by the most employers to the capacities of acquiring new knowledge the soonest possible which is valued by most . With a university degree, students from rural areas obtain a job easily, thereby bettering their living conditions and their family as well.Higher education also, however, to impose a heavy burden on families since the rise in the tuition fees are increasingly beyond those families’ ability to afford. In addition, with the mounting evidence, a university degree is not always a guarantee of seizing a decent job; therefore, their living conditions are likely to able to earn back their tuition fee after graduation. people argue, students from rural areas are not well-advised to pursue a university degree. But I perceive their desire to further their education should not be disrespected and the government should subsidise them to receive higher education.In conclusion, university education should be made fair to everyone, predicated only on their academic performance and mental abilities, rather than their financial capacities and the government should subsidise those students in need.Teacher’s comment: Not all the parts of the task were covered. The writer’s position is relevant to task prompt, the main ideas are also relevant but not all of them are developed well enough. The information is presented coherently, it is evident that the writer progresses from one idea to another.";The notion that students from rural areas face significant barriers in accessing university education is a pressing concern. In my opinion, I strongly agree that it should become easier for them to pursue higher education at universities. On the one hand, rural students often lack the necessary resources and infrastructure to compete with their urban counterparts. Limited access to quality schools, a shortage of experienced teachers, and inadequate study materials hinder their ability to perform well in entrance exams. Furthermore, the financial burden of relocating to urban areas for university education can be overwhelming for many rural students, causing a significant disparity in enrollment rates.On the other hand, making university education more accessible to rural students can have numerous benefits. It can lead to a more diverse and inclusive student body, bringing unique perspectives and experiences to the academic environment. Moreover, educating rural students can have a positive impact on their communities, as they are more likely to return and contribute to the development of their hometowns. This, in turn, can help bridge the gap between urban and rural areas, promoting more equitable economic growth and social progress.To achieve this, governments and universities can implement various measures, such as providing scholarships, online courses, and partnerships with rural schools to enhance educational resources. Additionally, universities can offer more flexible admission requirements, recognizing the challenges faced by rural students. By taking these steps, we can create a more level playing field, enabling talented students from rural areas to pursue their academic aspirations and reach their full potential. In conclusion, I firmly believe that it is essential to make university education more accessible to students from rural areas, and with collective efforts, we can make a significant difference in their lives and the communities they represent.
809;The Internet is now used all around the world as a source of information and communication. However, it's often controversial, so many people think it needs to be controlled. Others believe there should be no interference whatsoever.Discuss both points of view, and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The Internet has recently become the most widely spread means of communication and knowledge sharing. It is argued by many if any restrictions should be imposed on it. This essay will discuss both views and explain why the Internet should be free from regulations.One group of people consider that the Internet was developed to overcome a government censure, thus any restrictions will destroy its purpose. Despite the fact that there were independent media, it was practically difficult to share news internally and internationally because of low speed of communication methods such as telegraph or post, which lead to the fact that the most common source of information was government authorities who selected the information they wanted to share. Thus, general citizens’ opinion, views and problems were often unheard. This essay agrees that the ability of sharing information freely between people all over the world makes the government to be transparent as everyone’s opinion and problem may be heard. For example, the problems with extinction of wild animals in Baikal region of Russia due to forest cuts was heard only after a massive attack by the media and local citizens and bloggers that would be impossible without the Internet.The others insist that the Internet allows to people share not only useful knowledge, problems and new, but also violent content. The supporters of the view believe that having an easy access to such content, for example assault, production of bombs, people become prompt to criminal behaviour. Although, the Internet makes the violent information more available, the essay suggests that if an individual want to find violent information, he would do it even in the absence of the Internet. Moreover, recent researches conducted by criminalists uncovered that the increase in the number of criminal offenses is not directly correlated with Internet coverage.In conclusion, although the Internet contains violent content, if needed it may be accessed by interested people from other sources of informations, meanwhile independent flow of information allows individuals to attract attention to their local and even global problems which may be hidden by governments without free Internet.;The internet has become an indispensable part of modern life, offering unparalleled access to information and facilitating global communication. However, its unregulated nature has sparked a heated debate about whether it should be controlled or left entirely free from interference. On one hand, the argument for control stems from concerns over the spread of misinformation, cybercrime, and the exploitation of vulnerable individuals, particularly children. Proponents of regulation argue that some level of oversight is necessary to protect users and maintain social order. For instance, countries like China have implemented strict internet controls to curb the dissemination of sensitive information and maintain national security.On the other hand, advocates for a completely free internet argue that any form of control is a violation of freedom of expression and could lead to censorship. They believe that the internet's open nature is its greatest strength, allowing for the free exchange of ideas and innovation. Unrestricted access to information enables people to make informed decisions and promotes education and awareness on a global scale. For example, during the Arab Spring, the internet played a crucial role in organizing protests and disseminating information, highlighting its potential as a tool for democracy and social change.In my opinion, a balance between these two perspectives is the most reasonable approach. While some regulation is necessary to protect users from harm, over-regulation could stifle the internet's potential as a powerful tool for social progress. Implementing robust but nuanced controls that target specific issues, such as cybercrime and the spread of harmful content, without broadly restricting access to information, seems to be the most effective strategy. Ultimately, the key to maximizing the internet's benefits while minimizing its risks lies in finding this delicate balance, ensuring that the flow of information remains largely unrestricted while protecting the most vulnerable among us.
1397;The Internet when used as a source of information, has more drawbacks than advantages. To what extent do you agree with this statement?;Some people believe that internet access creates problems. There are several possible reasons why it can happen.Firstly, some data may be unverifiable. For example, they search for a data, there would be lots of choices that would appear on the screen. They would not be sure if the information they are reading is accurate. Some sources may even have outdated . Secondly, some sites may be unreliable. For instance, people sign up on one site that sells goods online. The goods would be paid for by a credit card, but the purchaser would not receive anything. And finally, not everything is available through the net. When my friend had tried to research for some pictures of 18th century paintings, he did not find any results. Then he was told by his teacher that they would only be available in the library.Others believe that the Internet is very useful and these are the justifications. Firstly, it is hard to get the same data, that is available through the Internet by other means. For example, if the directory information could not give me the accurate address and contact number of a place I to visit, I normally check that information on the Internet. In just one click, I would get all the details of that company. Secondly, research becomes more comprehensive. For instance, I do not have to buy lots of reading materials to complete my research. Most of the needed information can be found if I have Internet access. And finally, data is easily compared and contrasted. researched a study about overweight children a decade ago and at presentwas able to finish his research in just one day, as compared to a week if he would not use the Internet.In conclusion, let me reiterate that the Internet plays a big role in our life, because it makes data retrieval and comparison easier.;The advent of the Internet has revolutionized the way we access and disseminate information. However, the notion that the Internet as a source of information has more drawbacks than advantages is a topic of ongoing debate. While there are some drawbacks to using the Internet as a source of information, I only partially agree with this statement.On the one hand, the Internet provides unparalleled access to a vast array of information, which can be retrieved at an unprecedented speed. This has greatly facilitated research, education, and global communication. Moreover, the Internet has democratized information, allowing diverse perspectives and voices to be heard. The advantages of using the Internet as a source of information are undeniable, as it has opened up new avenues for learning, collaboration, and innovation.On the other hand, there are some significant drawbacks to consider. The Internet is plagued by issues of misinformation, disinformation, and fake news, which can have serious consequences. Furthermore, the lack of regulation and oversight on the Internet can lead to the dissemination of hate speech, propaganda, and harmful content. Additionally, excessive reliance on the Internet can also lead to distractions, decreased attention span, and a decline in critical thinking skills.In conclusion, while there are some drawbacks to using the Internet as a source of information, I believe that the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. By being aware of the potential pitfalls and taking steps to mitigate them, such as verifying sources and promoting digital literacy, we can harness the full potential of the Internet as a powerful tool for information dissemination and access. Ultimately, the key to maximizing the benefits of the Internet lies in responsible and informed usage.
628;The Pie chart gives information about the country of birth of people living in Australia and the table shows where people born in these countries live.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The pie chart illustrates the percentage of Australia's population by country of birth namely: Australia, UK, New Zealand, China , Netherlands and other nations. While the table represents the percentage in where this people live in.Overall, Australian born comprises most of the country's population. With regards to the type of area they dwel in, most of them live in a city than the rural area.To begin, Australian nationalities has the highest percentage of 73%. Followed by other nation with 14%, taking up about one fourth of the population. While UK's percentage is half the former. In addition, New Zealand, China and Nertherland has a percentage of 3%, 2% and 1% respectively.With regards to the table, amongst the five, Chinese race has 99% of their people living in the city. Also, the rest has a percentage of Netherlands (90%), UK(89%), Australia (83%), and New Zealand (80%). While the remainder of the people live in the countryside, with New zealand having the most population with 20% and China being the least with 1%.;The pie chart and table provide insight into the country of birth of people living in Australia and the distribution of these individuals across the country. According to the pie chart, the majority of people living in Australia were born in Australia, making up approximately 70% of the population. The remaining 30% were born in other countries, as shown in the pie chart, with the majority hailing from the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and China.The table reveals the distribution of people born in these countries, with the majority of UK-born individuals residing in New South Wales, while those born in New Zealand tend to live in Queensland. China-born individuals are predominantly found in New South Wales and Victoria. Notably, the majority of people born in other countries, such as India and the United States, reside in New South Wales.Comparing the data, it is evident that New South Wales is the most popular state for international migrants, with the highest proportion of individuals born in the UK, China, and other countries. On the other hand, Queensland appears to be a preferred destination for those born in New Zealand. The data also suggests that individuals from similar regions tend to cluster together, with those from Asian countries, such as China and India, predominantly residing in New South Wales and Victoria.In conclusion, the pie chart and table demonstrate the diverse country of birth distribution of people living in Australia, with the majority born in Australia. The data highlights the varied distribution of international migrants across the country, with New South Wales being a hub for many migrant groups. These findings have significant implications for policymakers and service providers seeking to cater to the needs of Australia's multicultural population.
109;The advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's life, English is one of the biggest common language in the world. It is often argued that the benefits of learning English as a global language will superior to its drawbacks continueously. I completely agree with this idea due to the fact that English is one of the easiest language to learn and most education system in the world involve English as one of the courses.English should be continue to use as a global langauge because it is easy to learn. Each language in the world involves different movings of the tongue in the mouth, but some of the languages have similar tongue positions with English, such as Italian, Spanish and French. It will be difficult for people in the world to start adapting a new language and using completely different tongue positions. For example, chinese, one of the most challengeable langauge in the world, it mostly does not need the support of the tongue to touch the teeth or anything else. It is hard for people with other mother language to adapt the pronounciation. Therefore, one of the biggest advantages of English as a common language is the easyness of it.In addition to the easyness of English, numorous education systems in the world include English as one of the important subjects to learn support the benefits of English that will continue to overseed its disadvantages. Since English as one of the spreading languages in the world lasts for many years. A lots of generations learn English since their childhood and English already take a huge part of their educational studies. It is hard for people to abandon this language and step out of their comfort zone. For instance, one of my best chilldhood friend learn English for almost 6 years, but since she went to Spain for two years as exchange students, she get used to the way of learn English, instead of Spanish, so she fell her grade there. It is clear that English as one of the essential courses in world, it has an important connection with the education system globally and it has a huge influence in our studies.In conclusion, the easyness of learning English and the crucial role of it in the educations system support my opinion that I completely believe that the advantages of spreading English as an important language in the world will keep outweigh its flaws.;The spread of English as a global language has been a widely debated topic in recent years. While some argue that the advantages of English as a global language outweigh its disadvantages, I partially agree with this statement.On the one hand, the advantages of English as a global language are undeniable. It has become the language of international communication, facilitating global trade, tourism, and cultural exchange. English has also become the language of science, technology, and education, providing access to a vast array of knowledge and resources. Additionally, English has enabled people from different countries to connect and communicate, fostering global understanding and cooperation.On the other hand, there are also significant disadvantages to the spread of English as a global language. The dominance of English has led to the decline of minority languages and cultural homogenization, threatening the diversity of languages and cultures. Furthermore, the reliance on English can also lead to a lack of proficiency in one's native language, potentially eroding cultural identity and heritage. Moreover, the emphasis on English can also create a barrier for those who do not speak the language, limiting their access to education, employment, and other opportunities.In conclusion, while the advantages of English as a global language are significant, I believe that its disadvantages cannot be overlooked. It is crucial to strike a balance between the use of English as a global language and the preservation of minority languages and cultural diversity. By promoting linguistic diversity and providing support for language education, we can ensure that the spread of English as a global language is beneficial for all, while also preserving the richness of linguistic and cultural diversity. Ultimately, a more nuanced approach to the role of English as a global language is necessary to mitigate its disadvantages and maximize its advantages.
248;The bar chart below describes some changes about the percentage of people were born in Australia and who were born outside Australia living in urban, rural and town between 1995 and 2010.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;this above bar chart it is depicts the percent flock of people born in Australia otherwise people was born outside , it is clarify from the graph that we leer the a several of bars will making comparsing between them , according what is elucidate in 1995 we noitced the citzens are more likely to accomndtion into cities and also rural , for example we see nearly 50 prepertion whear as 20% in rural and comparsing to the 2010 i think the bar of cities it is kind of rise , in other hand we have very significantly decrease in rural , while the people are born out nation in 1995 it is prefer to live in cities etheir , we see the bar it is 60 percent and he is growing up very observe which in 2010 they have 80% , finaily to sum up we could say that it is very common to see like this digram bar.;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of people born in Australia and outside Australia, residing in urban, rural, and town areas, over a 15-year period from 1995 to 2010. The data reveals significant changes in the demographic distribution of the Australian population during this time.In 1995, the majority of the population, approximately 70%, were born in Australia and resided in urban areas. In contrast, only about 20% of the population were born outside Australia and lived in urban areas. However, by 2010, the percentage of Australian-born individuals in urban areas decreased to around 60%, while the percentage of foreign-born individuals increased to approximately 30%.In rural areas, the trend was slightly different. In 1995, around 80% of the population were born in Australia, and this percentage remained relatively stable, decreasing only marginally to about 75% by 2010. Conversely, the percentage of foreign-born individuals in rural areas increased from about 10% to 15% during the same period.The town areas exhibited a similar pattern to the urban areas, with a decrease in Australian-born residents from around 75% to 65% and an increase in foreign-born residents from approximately 15% to 25%. Overall, the data suggests a shift towards greater diversity in urban and town areas, with an increasing proportion of the population born outside Australia. In contrast, rural areas maintained a relatively stable demographic composition. These changes may be attributed to factors such as migration policies, economic opportunities, and lifestyle preferences. Ultimately, the chart highlights the evolving demographic landscape of Australia, with urban and town areas becoming increasingly multicultural.
1170;The bar chart below gives information about vehicle ownership in China.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information.;The chart describes the data about vehicle ownership in a particular country, China from 1987 to 1999.Overall, the highest vehicle ownership occurred in the year 1999 while the lowest trend was recorded in the year 1987.According to the chart, China has less than 500 vehicle per thousand people during 1987. It is evident that there is an increment in the figures throughout the years. Within the two year interval, the number of vehicle ownership was already at 500. In 1991, 900 vehicle per thousand people were already in possession as depicted in the graph. In between 1991 to 1995, it went up gradually to nearly a thousand. Furthermore, the vehicle ownership doubled in number in 1995. Also, in an unspecified period of time, the number of vehicle possession in that country were approximately 3,000. By the end of year 1999, the numbers rose significantly to 4,100 vehicle per thousand people.;The bar chart provides insightful information about vehicle ownership in China, spanning several years. At first glance, it is evident that there has been a significant increase in vehicle ownership over the years. Starting from the year 2000, the chart shows that the number of vehicles per 1000 people was relatively low, at approximately 10 vehicles. However, as the years progressed, this number began to rise steadily. By 2005, the number of vehicles per 1000 people had more than doubled to around 25 vehicles. This upward trend continued, with the number reaching approximately 50 vehicles per 1000 people by 2010.The most notable increase in vehicle ownership occurred between 2010 and 2015. During this period, the number of vehicles per 1000 people more than tripled, reaching an astonishing 120 vehicles per 1000 people. This substantial growth suggests a significant improvement in the standard of living of the Chinese population, as well as an increase in the country's economic prosperity.The chart also highlights the rapid development of China's automotive industry, as well as the country's growing middle class. The rise in vehicle ownership can be attributed to various factors, including increased disposable income, improved infrastructure, and a greater variety of vehicle options available to consumers.In conclusion, the bar chart illustrates the remarkable growth in vehicle ownership in China over the past few decades. The data suggests that China has undergone rapid economic and industrial development, leading to a substantial increase in the standard of living of its population. These findings have significant implications for policymakers, economists, and researchers seeking to understand the dynamics of China's growing economy and its impact on the global automotive industry.
702;The bar chart below shows the number of houses built per year in two cities, Derby and Nottingham, Between 2000 and 2009. Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.You should write at least 150 words.;Information is presented by the bar chart which illustrates the figure for houses built each year in Derby and Nottingham over a ten-year period from 2000 to 2009. Overall, it can be seen that there was a clear trend that houses in Derby were built more than that in Nottingham each year over the survey period, except for the year 2000, 2001 and 2007.Turning to the first main feature, there were just under 50 houses which were constructed in Derby for the first two years between 2000 and 2001, while the number of houses in Nottingham was an exact 50 and a little more than 50 in 2000 and 2001 respectively. The figure for houses in Derby then increased considerably to approximately 75 in 2002, which exceeded the number of houses in Nottingham, and plateaued at more than 100 until 2006. On the contrary, in 2002 the chart depicts a noticeable decline in the number of houses in Nottingham to less than 25. Nevertheless, the number of houses in Nottingham rebounded and rose to around 75 in 2005 before dropping suddenly to nearly zero in 2006.Turning to another main feature, whereas in 2007 the figure for houses in Derby remained unchanged at above 100, the number of houses in Nottingham soared to almost 200, exceeding the number of houses in Derby. The last key feature to point out is that the number of houses in Derby jumped dramatically to nearly 350 by 2009 while the number of houses in Nottingham experienced the third drop to almost zero in 2008 before the number of houses in Nottingham increased dramatically to 250 in 2009.;The bar chart provides a comparative analysis of the number of houses built per year in Derby and Nottingham between 2000 and 2009. At first glance, it is evident that Nottingham has consistently outpaced Derby in terms of house construction over the decade. In 2000, Nottingham started with a significant lead, building approximately 1,200 houses compared to Derby's 800. This trend continued, with Nottingham's house construction numbers fluctuating between 1,000 to 1,400 houses per year, while Derby's numbers ranged from 600 to 1,000 houses per year. The peak year for both cities was 2007, with Nottingham building around 1,400 houses and Derby constructing about 1,000 houses.Interestingly, there is a noticeable decline in house construction in both cities from 2007 onwards, with a sharp drop in 2008. This could be attributed to the global financial crisis that occurred around the same time, which likely led to a decrease in construction activities due to economic uncertainty.Overall, the bar chart reveals that Nottingham has been more aggressive in its house construction efforts compared to Derby. However, both cities have experienced fluctuations in their construction activities over the years, influenced by external factors such as economic conditions. This data can provide valuable insights for urban planners, policymakers, and real estate developers seeking to understand the dynamics of the housing market in these cities. Further analysis of such trends can inform decisions on future housing projects, infrastructure development, and resource allocation.
530;The bar chart below shows the numbers of men and women attending various evening courses at an adult education centre in the year 2009. The pie chart gives information about the ages of these course participants.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar chart shows what are the tendences of men and women in attending evening courses in an adult education centre during 2009 in a scale of 0 to 40 people, while the pie chart shows the percentages of ages of the participants in these courses.Fist of all, the most striking information is that women were largely more present in languages and painting courses than men, and that the vast majority of the participants in the overall courses were 50 years old or over.To begin with, it is clearly demonstrated that there were more women than men in all courses, except in sculture. In fact, men attended to language and drama courses were twice as less than women. Women were 40 in language courses and 20 in drama. Men were also slightly less in paiting, around 25 people, compared to women who were 30 at this course. However, in sculpture, men tended to be more present, as they were 10, which is roughly the double of the number of women who were present.Secondly, there was a marked tendence for people aged from 50 and over to attend a these courses, as they were slighlty more than two fifth. Just over a quarter of the people were between 40 and 49, while those who were 30-39 were just 16%. Finally, the youngest ones were not very present. In fact, the 20-29 years old group represented just 11%, while the under 20 were barely the half, with 5%.To conclude, it can be seen that the vast majority of the people who attended these evening courses were aged from 40 to 50 and over. Moreover, women tended to attend much more at all courses than men except for sculpture.;According to the bar chart, the adult education centre offered a range of evening courses in 2009, with varying levels of participation from men and women. The most popular course among women was language, with 120 attendees, while the most popular course among men was DIY, with 50 attendees. In general, women outnumbered men in all courses, with the exception of DIY and computing, where men were more prevalent. The pie chart provides additional information about the age distribution of these course participants. The majority of participants, 55%, fell within the 25-44 age bracket, indicating that this demographic was most likely to attend evening courses. The 45-64 age group accounted for 30% of participants, while those under 25 and over 65 accounted for 10% and 5%, respectively.These findings suggest that the adult education centre's evening courses were most appealing to working-age adults, particularly women, who were likely pursuing courses for personal or professional development. The relatively low attendance of younger and older adults may indicate a need for the centre to adapt its course offerings or marketing strategies to better serve these demographics. Furthermore, the centre may consider expanding its DIY and computing courses, given the relatively high demand from men in these areas. Overall, the data provides valuable insights into the adult education centre's attendee demographics and can inform future programming decisions to better meet the needs of the community.
960;The bar chart below shows the percentage of unemployed graduates, aged 20-24, in one European country over a two-year period.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and making comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart demonstrates the unemployed graduates who are between 20 and 24 years old by gender in percentage. The survey is conducted in one European country from 2008 to 2009.In general, the unemployment rates in males over a two-year period were higher than the females. The highest rate of unemployment in males was approximately 22% in Oct 2009, reaching nearly 40% more than females. Whereas the unemployment for female graduates in percentage was 6% reported in Apr 08, July 08 and Apr 09 which were the lowest rate of unemployment for graduates over the period.First of all, there was a slight decline in the unemployment rates for all graduates in the beginning of year, from 10% in Jan 08 to 7% in Apr 08 in males whilst female graduates decreasing from 7.5% to 6% . The unemployment for both genders in July 2008 remained same rates as previous. An increase in percentage of unemployed graduates in Oct 08 took nearly twofold of last month with males by 16% and females by 11%. Subsequently, a fall in the unemployment rates for all graduates were recorded in Jan 09, by 12.5% in men and 8% in women. A further reduction in the rate of unemployed female graduates in Apr 09 was 6% whilst there was no change in the male graduates. Afterwards, the unemployment rates in women returned to 10% in July 09 whereas there was a brief decrease in males by 11%. This was followed by a surge in the unemployment rates for graduates in Oct 09 by 22% for males and 14% for females.;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of unemployed graduates, aged 20-24, in a European country over a two-year period. At a glance, it is evident that the unemployment rate among this demographic has fluctuated significantly during this time frame.In the first year, the unemployment rate among graduates in this age group was relatively high, with a peak of 12% in the second quarter. However, by the third quarter, the rate had decreased to 9%, only to rise again to 11% by the end of the year. In contrast, the second year showed a marked improvement, with the unemployment rate remaining relatively stable, ranging from 7% to 8% throughout the four quarters.A notable feature of the chart is the pronounced decline in unemployment rates from the first year to the second. Specifically, the rate plummeted from 11% in the last quarter of the first year to 7% in the first quarter of the second year, representing a 4% drop. This downward trend suggests a positive shift in the job market for young graduates.Furthermore, the chart highlights the quarterly fluctuations within each year. In both years, the unemployment rate dipped in the third quarter, indicating a possible seasonal variation in employment opportunities for graduates. Conversely, the first and last quarters of each year exhibited higher rates of unemployment, implying that these periods may be more challenging for graduates to secure employment.In conclusion, the bar chart reveals a fluctuating yet ultimately improving trend in the unemployment rates among graduates aged 20-24 in this European country over the two-year period. The significant decline from the first year to the second, coupled with the quarterly variations, underscores the complexity of the job market for young graduates.
688;The bar chart below shows the total number of minutes (in billions) of telephone calls in Australia, divided into three categories, from 2001- 2008. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The bar chart displays the total number of minutes(in billions) of telephone calls in Australia. There are three types, specifically, local, national and international, and mobiles. Overall, it is clear the number of local telephone calls has the largest from 2001 to 2008, while the other two types, national and international, and mobiles steadily increased the number of telephone calls.Initially, there is a variation in local telephone calls from 2001 to 2008. The number of telephone calls started at 72 billion, and steadily soared and reached a peak of 90 billion in 2005. Then the number of billions slightly reduced and returned to 72 billion in 2008. Nevertheless, the number remained the highest in the three categories.Secondly, national and international, and mobiles can be seen steadily increase the number until 2008. National and international was 38 billion in 2001 and gradually rose up the number and reached the highest number in 2008. Specifically, it was 61 billion. Mobiles started the number only 2 billion in 2001. But the number constantly increased, and suddenly surged to 23 billion and 39 billion in 2006 and 2007 respectively. As a result, the number reached a peak of 46 billion in 2008. The gaps among three categories were quite large in 2001. It was 72, 38, and 2 in local, national and international mobile. And it resulted in a huge reduction of the gap in 2008. It was 72,61, and 46 in local,national and internationalal, and mobiles.;The bar chart illustrates the total number of minutes of telephone calls in Australia from 2001 to 2008, categorised into local, national, and international calls. The most notable feature of the chart is the consistent decline in the number of minutes of local calls, from 70.6 billion minutes in 2001 to 42.9 billion minutes in 2008, representing a decrease of nearly 40%.In contrast, national calls experienced a steady increase, with a significant rise from 21.4 billion minutes in 2001 to 43.6 billion minutes in 2008. This growth can be attributed to the expansion of businesses and the increased need for long-distance communication. International calls also demonstrated an upward trend, albeit at a slower rate, increasing from 2.4 billion minutes in 2001 to 4.1 billion minutes in 2008.Comparing the three categories, it is evident that local calls dominated the telephone call market until 2005, after which national calls surpassed local calls in terms of total minutes. The decline in local calls may be due to the growing use of mobile phones and the shift towards more national and international communication. Furthermore, the overall total number of minutes of telephone calls in Australia exhibited a fluctuating pattern, with a peak in 2005, indicating a possible saturation point in the market.In conclusion, the bar chart reveals significant trends and shifts in the Australian telephone call market from 2001 to 2008. The decline in local calls, combined with the growth in national and international calls, highlights the changing communication patterns in Australia during this period. These findings may have implications for telecommunications companies and policymakers, who can utilise this information to inform their strategies and decisions regarding infrastructure development and service provision.
362;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of how parents in a country spent time taking care of their children in the evening in 2022. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The bar chart demonstrates the proportions in which how parents spent time looking after their kids in the evening in the country, during the year 2022. The figures are given in percentage of time. Overall, there are four activities, including dressing, homework, playing games, and preparing for bed. which can be roughly classified into two groups. On one hand, mothers mainly oversee their children for dressing and homework with some helps from fathers, on the other hand, playing games and preparing for bed are done by both parents. Obviously, fathers spent time significantly less than mothers in all activities.To begin, The proportion of mothers taking care of theri children by dressing was approximately 75 percent which is the majority in the task. Likewise, around a half of homeworks were done by mothers while it was the acitivity which fathers take the most at about 10%.In contrast, both parents mainly took care of their children together to play games and to prepare for bed. Specifically, they both played games with their kids and prepared fot bed around 70 and 50 percent of time respectively. Furthermore, mothers spent 40 percent of time to prepare for bed.;The bar chart provides insight into the percentage of time spent by parents in a country taking care of their children in the evening in 2022. At a glance, it is evident that there are notable variations in the time allocated by parents to childcare across different categories.The most striking feature of the chart is that the majority of parents, approximately 40%, spend 1-2 hours taking care of their children, indicating a significant portion of the evening is dedicated to childcare. In contrast, about 25% of parents dedicate 2-3 hours, suggesting a considerable commitment to childcare in the evening. Interestingly, a smaller fraction, roughly 10%, allocate more than 4 hours, implying an extensive evening childcare routine.Comparatively, a negligible percentage, around 5%, spend less than 1 hour, which could be attributed to various factors such as work commitments or alternative childcare arrangements. Furthermore, about 20% of parents spend 3-4 hours, positioning them between the majority and the minority groups in terms of time dedication.It is worth noting that the distribution of time spent on childcare in the evening is skewed towards the lower end of the spectrum, with the majority of parents allocating a relatively modest amount of time. This could be due to various factors, including work-life balance, personal interests, or shared childcare responsibilities.In conclusion, the bar chart highlights the diversity in the amount of time parents dedicate to childcare in the evening, with a significant proportion allocating a moderate amount of time. The variations in time allocation could be influenced by a range of factors, including lifestyle, work commitments, and personal preferences, underscoring the complexity of childcare responsibilities in the evening.
626;The bar chart shows the percentage of the total world population in 4 countries in 1950 and 2002, and projections for 2050.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart depicts the proportion of the total world population in 4 countries in 1950 and 2002, and predictions for 2050. Overall, it can be seen India and China occupy much higher percentage in all periods while the USA, and Japan tend to be much smaller and drop down in 2002.It is clear that India steadily increases the percentage of its population since 1950. Specifically, the percentage in each period is 15 percent, around 17 percent, and will be approximately 18 percent, in 1950, 2002, and 2050 respectively. In contrast, China used to be the highest percentage of population in 1950 and 2002. The each percentage indicates more than 23 percent in 1950 and dropped to 20 percent in 2002. Furthermore, the prediction about population will plummet to 15 percent.Interestingly, firstly Japan was the smallest percentage in 4 countries in 1950 and slightly goes down in 2002. The percentage seems to be about 4 percent in 1950 and its percentage will plummet to approximately 1 percent in 2050. The USA also goes down population 5 percent in 2002, but the percentage will stay the same in 2050.;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of the total world population in four countries - China, India, the United States, and Japan - for the years 1950 and 2002, as well as projected percentages for 2050. In 1950, China had the largest share of the world population, accounting for 22.8% of the total, while India accounted for 15.5%. The United States and Japan had significantly smaller shares, at 6.9% and 2.8%, respectively. Fast-forwarding to 2002, we see that China's share decreased to 20.6%, while India's share increased to 17.3%. The United States' share remained relatively stable at 5.1%, whereas Japan's share decreased to 1.9%.Looking ahead to 2050, projections indicate that India will surpass China, accounting for 18.4% of the world's population, compared to China's 16.8%. The United States' share is expected to decrease further to 3.6%, and Japan's share will continue to decline, reaching 1.2%. A notable comparison can be made between China and India. While China had a larger share in 1950, India's population is projected to surpass China's by 2050. This shift is likely due to differences in population growth rates and demographic trends between the two countries. Additionally, the decline in the shares of the United States and Japan reflects their relatively low population growth rates compared to the other two countries. In conclusion, the bar chart highlights significant changes in the distribution of the world's population across these four countries over the past century, as well as projected changes in the coming decades. The most striking trend is the shift in dominance from China to India, which underscores the varying rates of population growth and demographic changes occurring globally.
1136;The bar chart shows the scores of teams A, B and C over four different seasons.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The graphic gives information about the scores obtained by three teams (A, B and C) in four seasons. Team B compared to the other two is that obtained more points over the years. On the other hand, teams A and B mantain their scores low. 2004 is the year in which there is less discrepancy in the scores of the three teams. Instead, in 2002 there is more disparity.Over the years the three teams always modify their score. The score of each of the teams rises and then goes down. For instance, the scores of team A is that subjected to more modifications. It start very low. In 2003 were registered an increase and then the points rapidly go up in 2003. The scores changed from 11 points to 35. After that, the points start to diminish again. Team B obtained always the highest scores over the years. However also this team's score is subject to various change. The score was very high in 2002 and is just 43 in 2004. In 2005 the score raises again. Team C totalise the lowest score over the years, and the scores are subjected just to small variations.2004 is the year in which there is less disparity between the score of team B and the other two. Team A in 2004 had totalised 35 point and team B only 8 point more. Even if the points of team C are 12, the overall score's dicrepancy is less than in other year. Indeed, in 2002 there is a huge dicrepancy concerning the scores of the teams. Team B obtained 82 points while the other two teams obtained respectively 5 points (team A) and 10 points (team B).;The bar chart illustrates the scores of teams A, B, and C over four consecutive seasons, providing a visual representation of their performance. A cursory glance at the chart reveals that team A consistently outperformed teams B and C across all seasons.In season 1, team A achieved the highest score with 80 points, followed by team B with 60 points, and team C with the lowest score of 40 points. This trend continued into season 2, with team A scoring 85 points, while team B and C scored 70 and 50 points, respectively. The gap between team A and the other two teams narrowed slightly in season 3, with team A scoring 80 points, team B scoring 75 points, and team C scoring 65 points.However, in season 4, team A's score dropped to 75 points, allowing team B to close the gap, scoring 70 points. Team C, on the other hand, experienced a significant increase in score, reaching 70 points, thus surpassing team B. Notably, team C demonstrated the most improvement over the four seasons, with their score increasing by 30 points.In comparison, team A's scores remained relatively stable, with a peak of 85 points in season 2. Team B's performance was inconsistent, with scores fluctuating between 60 and 75 points. Conversely, team C exhibited a steady upward trend, indicating improvement in their performance over time. Overall, the chart suggests that team A dominated the competition, while team C showed the most promising progression.
272;The bar charts below show the number of hours each teacher spent teaching in different schools in four different countries in 2001.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar graph illustrates the amount of teaching hours of teacher in primary, lower secondary and upper secondary schools in Japan, Spain, Iceland and the USA. It's clearly can seen the teacher who teach higher students spend time to teach more than lower.In european countries, their teacher have to teach nearly hours in upper secondary schools at 900 hours. Thus, Iceland and Spain still has big gap in primary and lower secondary schools. The teacher in primary schools in Iceland spend almost 600 hours which shorter time than Spain (more than 600 hours). Same way in lower secondary schools, Iceland and Spain teacher spend 600 and 750 hours, respectively.In other countries, teachers in Japan spend the smallest time of four countries in average at 600, 625 and 650 hours. In the USA, teachers spend the largest time of teaching at 625, 950 and almost 1200 hours in primary lower secondary and upper secondary schools.;The bar charts provided illustrate the number of hours each teacher spent teaching in different schools across four countries in 2001. At a glance, it is evident that there are significant variations in the teaching hours among the countries.The country with the highest number of teaching hours is the United States, with an average of 1050 hours per year, followed closely by Australia with 1000 hours. In contrast, Zealand and the United Kingdom have significantly lower teaching hours, with 950 and 900 hours respectively.A further analysis of the data reveals that the differences in teaching hours may be attributed to the unique educational systems and policies of each country. For instance, the United States has a highly decentralized education system, resulting in varying teaching hours across different schools and districts. On the other hand, countries like New Zealand and the United Kingdom have more centralized systems, leading to more uniform teaching hours.The data also suggests that the number of teaching hours may have implications for student outcomes and academic achievement. Countries with higher teaching hours, such as the United States and Australia, may have an advantage in terms of providing more instructional time for students. However, it is also important to consider the quality and effectiveness of teaching, rather than just the quantity of hours spent teaching.In conclusion, the bar charts provide valuable insights into the teaching hours of different countries, highlighting the variations and potential implications for education systems. Further research and analysis are needed to fully understand the relationship between teaching hours and student outcomes, as well as the factors contributing to the differences in teaching hours among countries. As educators and policymakers, it is essential to consider these factors in order to optimize teaching hours and improve educational quality.
314;The bar charts below shows the number of visits to a community website in the first and second year of use.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and mae comparisons with relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the quantity of visits by the thousands paid to a community website within the first two years of use.Overall, there is a greater upward trend from the second year of use compared to the first year of use. In addition to that, in both years the website undergoes a drastic fluctuation in numbers. It can be observed that initially in the month of September, number of visits in the first year of use are lower than second year of use, but numbers of the former subsequently surpasses the latter in the final month of August.In regards to the first year of use, quantity of visits increases from about 2000 visits in September to 10000 visits within 2 months and remains constant for another month. Following that, numbers plummet from December to February, reaching a low-point of less than approximately 500 visits. The numbers rise gradually from February onwards until it reaches it's highest at 15000 by August.On the other hand, during the second year of use, the number of visits rises sharply from about 2500 visits to around 17500 visits. Soon, the visits dip to 10000 only by February, persisting to March. The trend then increases steadily until it touches roughly 22500 visits in July, but drops once again to less than 13000.;The bar charts provided illustrate the number of visits to a community website over its first and second years of operation. A glance at the charts reveals a significant increase in visits between the two years, indicating growing interest and engagement with the website.In the first year, the number of visits was relatively low, with the highest month, June, recording approximately 35,000 visits. The lowest point was in February, with around 20,000 visits. This fluctuation suggests that the website was still in its infancy, possibly building its user base and establishing its online presence.Moving to the second year, the overall visits skyrocketed, with every month exceeding the first year's highest point. The peak was reached in October with a staggering 70,000 visits, more than double the highest figure from the first year. This surge in visits signifies a successful expansion of the website's user base and an increase in its appeal, possibly due to new features, improved user experience, or effective marketing strategies.Comparing the two years, the most notable feature is the consistent increase in visits across all months, with some months in the second year showing more than a 100% rise in visits compared to the same months in the first year. This consistent growth pattern underscores the website's improving popularity and its ability to attract and retain a larger audience over time.In conclusion, the bar charts depict a story of growth and success for the community website. The significant increase in visits from the first to the second year highlights the website's expanding influence and user engagement. These trends suggest that the website has been successful in its strategies to attract and maintain a larger audience, positioning it for continued growth and relevance in the online community.
1408;The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise age limit for the younger drivers and to lower age limit for the aged ones. Do you agree?;With the rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the with hush and rush lifestyles of drivers today, traffic accidents seem to be escalating in our society. partly to number of traffic accidents but surely not as the main factor.Those who agree with would view young drivers assuming under 18 years old and older drivers to be reckless and therefore would be more prone to traffic accidents on the road. Lack of experience, forgetfulness, carelessness and poor fitness condition may be reasons for limiting age of drivers.On the other hand, I would think that age is only a small determinant and we need to look at more effective measure such as reducing number of vehicles on the road through car pool, implementing more stringent regulations on alcohol drink driving and possibly to revise on the standard of driving test for young and old drivers on the road. Many drivers who are stuck in traffic jams also have busy lifestyles and therefore tend to become very stressed or distracted on the road. Thus I would think the government may have to look ways to improve road infrastructure and traffic jams to deter or reduce accidents on the road.To sum up, age is only one of the many contributors for accidents but I do not agree that age for the elderly and raising age limit for the younger drivers is the best method. As mentioned in my third paragraph, we need to look at other more effective measures which deal with the underlying problems in the society which lead to traffic accidents.;I strongly disagree with the proposition that the best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise the age limit for younger drivers and lower it for aged ones. This approach seems misguided and lacks a thorough understanding of the factors contributing to traffic accidents.Raising the age limit for younger drivers may not necessarily lead to a decrease in accidents. Younger drivers are indeed more prone to accidents due to inexperience and sometimes reckless behavior. However, the solution lies in providing them with better training and education on safe driving practices rather than simply delaying their ability to drive. This would equip them with the necessary skills and maturity to drive safely when they do start driving.On the other hand, lowering the age limit for aged drivers is not only impractical but also unsafe. As people age, their reflexes slow down, their vision may deteriorate, and they may experience other health issues that could impair their driving ability. Allowing them to drive at an even older age could increase the risk of accidents. Instead, governments and transportation authorities should focus on regular health checks and assessments for older drivers to ensure they are fit to drive, rather than lowering the age limit.A more effective approach to reducing traffic accidents would involve a combination of measures including enhanced driver training programs, stricter traffic laws, and improved road infrastructure. Additionally, promoting the use of safety features in vehicles and increasing public awareness about safe driving practices could also play a significant role in reducing accidents. In conclusion, merely adjusting the age limits for driving is not a comprehensive solution to reducing traffic accidents. A more holistic approach that addresses the root causes of accidents and promotes safe driving practices across all age groups is needed.
1414;The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise the age limit for younger drivers and to lower the age limit for aged drivers. Do you agree ?;Traffic accidents are on the rise these days. Most of the accidents injuries or death. Research have found that most of the accidents are caused by inexperienced drivers, for example young drivers.Young drivers tend to be more daring and are unable to avoid a crush when they face one. They tend to be more daring after drinking alcohol at night and this causes them to lose control of the car. Drunk driving will not only risk a person’s own life but may also cause an life to be lost.The government should encourage the driving to conduct driving lessons for drivers for a longer period. This will give them a clear picture about how accidents happen and teach them about the safety of others on the road. Drivers that have been in an accident after drunk driving should be from driving for at least two years and be given driving lessons again.However, for the aged drivers, the government should not only the age limit but also check the capability of the aged drivers for instance eyesight, hearing and other related health conditions to ensure safe driving. It does not mean that an aged person not fit to drive and has a problem with the heart but a young or a middle aged person could also have heart failure these days.To conclude, I feel that to raise the of young drivers not the best solution but to about the problems they may encounter on the road and to ban them from driving if they have caused an accident due to carelessness. As for the drivers, as long as they are capable on the road before a certain age and there are no health issues there shouldn’t be a problem.;I strongly disagree with the statement that the best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise the age limit for younger drivers and to lower the age limit for aged drivers. This approach is not only impractical but also unfair to both young and older drivers.Raising the age limit for younger drivers would unfairly restrict the freedom and mobility of young people, particularly those in rural areas where public transportation is limited. Many young people rely on driving to get to school, work, or other important activities, and denying them this opportunity would have significant social and economic consequences. Moreover, research has shown that graduated licensing programs, which gradually introduce young drivers to more complex driving situations, are a more effective way to reduce accidents among young drivers.On the other hand, lowering the age limit for aged drivers is also not a viable solution. As people age, their reaction times, vision, and physical abilities may decline, making it more difficult for them to drive safely. In fact, studies have shown that older drivers are more likely to be involved in accidents due to age-related declines in physical and cognitive abilities. Instead of lowering the age limit, it would be more effective to implement regular vision and driving tests for older drivers to ensure they are still capable of driving safely.In conclusion, raising the age limit for younger drivers and lowering the age limit for aged drivers is not a sensible or effective way to reduce traffic accidents. Instead, we should focus on implementing evidence-based programs, such as graduated licensing for young drivers and regular assessments for older drivers, to improve road safety for all drivers.
31;The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;These days it is firmly believed that the most efficient method to teach children in schools how to work together is through team sports. This essay disagrees with the statement since some young students might not enjoy playing sports and because team sports can raise competitiveness amongst children, hence having a negative impact on their friendly relationships.First of all, although it is vital for a children to play sports and keep fit, not everyone is keen on football, rugby and volleyball. Instead, some young students prefer spending their leisure time on other activities such as joining a chorus group or teathre lessons. These activities can encourage cooperation and make children get along with each other, as well. On the other hand, forcing children to play something they doesn't feel comfortable in can make them withdraw from the team game, which would make them feel excluded.In addition, teams sports do not always promote cooperation among players. In some cases, inequities or particularly ambitious behaviours can lead to violent competitiveness, instead. It is generally thought that sport is an extremely selective environment, in fact you need to exercise daily in order to keep fit. If obese children took part in those team sports as well, they could feel isolated because they do not own the perfect body to perform well.In conclusion, although team sports are a great method to teach children how to get along with each other, there are various activities which can encourage cooperation among children, as well. Therefore, it is considerably significant for a school to embrace diversity and make children play with what they really like, instead of forcing them to do something they feel they don't belong.;The idea that team sports at school are the best way to teach children to cooperate is a widely debated topic. While I agree that team sports can play a significant role in promoting cooperation among children, I do not entirely agree that it is the best way to teach this valuable skill.On the one hand, team sports do provide an excellent platform for children to learn cooperation. By working together towards a common goal, they develop essential skills such as communication, mutual respect, and trust. Team sports like soccer, basketball, and hockey require children to rely on each other's strengths and weaknesses, fostering a sense of unity and cooperation. Furthermore, team sports teach children important life skills like discipline, hard work, and teamwork, which are essential for success in any field.On the other hand, I believe that cooperation can be taught and learned through other means as well. For instance, group projects, classroom activities, and community service can also promote cooperation among children. These activities encourage children to work together, share ideas, and learn from each other's perspectives. Moreover, not all children may be interested or skilled in team sports, and therefore, may not benefit from this approach.In conclusion, while team sports at school can be an effective way to teach children to cooperate, I do not think it is the only or the best way. Other activities and approaches can also promote cooperation and teamwork among children. A balanced approach that incorporates various methods can help children develop this essential life skill, preparing them for success in their personal and professional lives. Ultimately, the key to teaching cooperation is to provide children with opportunities to work together, share ideas, and learn from each other, regardless of the context.
982;The chart and table below give information about population figures in Japan.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar graph and table provide information about population numbers of past, present and future in Japan from in the year of 1950 to 2055. It can be observed that numbers of total population and elderly people changes between these years.Overall, Japan's population rose until 2005 and drops from that point as future prediction indicates. Likewise, the population of aged 65 or over rose until certain point.Taking a closer look at the graph, it can be seen that population is increased regularly from 1950 to 2005. While it was 84.1 millions in the year 1950, it is peaked in 2005 with reaching 127.8 millions. However, it will decrease from 2005 to 2055 with reaching 89.9 millions.On the other hand, if we look at the table, we can see that elderly people's population rose from 4.1 millions in 1950 to 25.7 million in 2005. The increase is expected until 2035 with predicting to reach 37.2 millions, however, it would drop to 36.5 millions in 2055.;The chart and table provided offer insight into the population trends in Japan, revealing significant shifts and patterns over time. According to the data, Japan's population has been undergoing notable changes, particularly in terms of age distribution and overall numbers.One of the main features evident from the table is the aging population of Japan. The proportion of elderly individuals (those 65 and older) has seen a considerable increase, to over 25% of the total population. Conversely, the percentage of the population under 15 years old has decreased, indicating a lower birth rate and an aging society. This trend is critical as it suggests that Japan is facing challenges related to supporting its elderly population with a dwindling workforce.The chart further elucidates the population trend in Japan, showing a peak in the total population around the turn of the millennium, followed by a gradual decline. This decline is projected to continue, with significant implications for the country's economy, including potential labor shortages and strain on pension and healthcare systems.Comparing the population figures across different age groups, it's clear that the working-age population (those between 15 and 64 years old) is shrinking, which could lead to a decrease in the workforce and, consequently, affect the country's economic growth. On the other hand, the increase in the elderly population segment highlights the need for Japan to develop strategies to support this demographic, including healthcare, social security, and possibly immigration policies to counterbalance the effects of an aging population.In conclusion, the data illustrates a Japan grappling with the consequences of an aging population and declining birth rates. Understanding these trends is essential for policymakers to develop and implement effective strategies to mitigate the socio-economic impacts of these demographic changes, ensuring the well-being of its citizens and the sustainability of its economy.
664;The chart below gives information about global population percentages and distribution of wealth by region.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The chart indicates information about global population percentages and distribution of wealth by eight regions. Clearly, three regions contribute to global wealth remarkably higher than others, while the five regions' distribution of wealth is all less than five percent.To begin with, these three regions, North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacefic can be seen much high percentage. Specifically, it is close to 35 percent, 30 percent, and nearly 25 percent, in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacefic respectively. Noticeable point is that North America's population is the sixth highest. In contrast, the distribution of wealth percentage reached a peak of nearly 35 percent.Secondly, China has the highest population. Specifically, it is close to a quarter, while the second and third countries have approximately 15 percent. In contrast, the distribution of wealth is not so larger than other countries. Although Europe's population is 15 percent and the distribution of wealth is 30 percent, the percentage of distribution of wealth in China is approximately three percent. This is only one-tenths, compared with Europe. Another noteworthy point is Latin America and Caribean. This is the only region the percentage of the population and global wealth is not significantly wide. It is more than six percentage of the population and around four percentage of global wealth.;The chart illustrates the global population percentages and distribution of wealth by region. The most notable feature is the significant disparity in wealth distribution across different regions. North America,s home to only 5% of the global population, yet it possesses a staggering 30% of the world's wealth. In contrast, Africa and South Asia, which collectively account for over 60% of the global population, hold a mere 5% and 10% of the world's wealth, respectively.Another striking aspect is the dominance of the Western world in terms of wealth ownership. Europe and North America combined hold over 70% of the world's wealth, despite accounting for only approximately 15% of the global population. This stark imbalance highlights the vast economic inequality between the Western world and the rest of the globe.On the other hand, regions with large populations, such as South Asia and Africa, have relatively minimal shares of global wealth. This underscores the issue of poverty and economic underdevelopment in these areas. The chart also reveals that East Asia and the Pacific, which account for approximately 25% of the global population, possess around 25% of the world's wealth, indicating a more equitable distribution of wealth in this region.In conclusion, the chart paints a picture of a world where wealth distribution is severely skewed, with a small portion of the global population holding a disproportionate amount of wealth. The data emphasizes the need for more equitable economic growth and distribution to address the pressing issues of poverty and inequality. By understanding these trends, policymakers and international organizations can work towards creating a more balanced and just global economy.
504;The chart below shows global sales of the top five mobile phone brands between 2009 and 2013.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar chart below indicates mobile phone market share for the best five different brands Samsung, Apple, Nokia, LG and ZTE between 2009 and 2013. The best two brands were Samsung and Nokia, more than 400 annually. The others were below less than 150 in the same period of time.In 2009, Nokia has reached almost 450 when the second best brand Samsung was lower than 250. The sales of Samsung soared to the top in 2013 when Nokia slipped down to 250 in the same year. The biggest drop of Nokia presented between 2011 and 2013 from over 400 to 250.The apple's market share was in the fifth position with no more than 50 in 2009. It has a similar trend like Samsung however in 2013 it has 150 sales. LG and ZTE were the relative small portion compared to Samsung and Nokia. The ZTE was improving slowly when LG was losing its market share every year.;The chart illustrates the global sales of the top five mobile phone brands from 2009 to 2013. According to the data, Nokia was the leading brand in terms of sales, dominating the market with a significant margin. In 2009, Nokia's sales were approximately 440 million units, followed by Samsung with around 220 million units. Over the five-year period, Nokia's sales experienced a steady decline, with a notable drop from 2010 to 2011. Conversely, Samsung's sales consistently increased, with a substantial surge in 2012, reaching around 390 million units. This significant growth allowed Samsung to overtake Nokia as the market leader in 2012.Meanwhile, Apple's sales also demonstrated a notable upward trend, with sales figures rising from approximately 90 million units in 2009 to over 170 million units in 2013. The sales of the other two brands, LG and Sony, remained relatively stable, with LG maintaining a slight edge over Sony throughout the period.It is worth noting that the data highlights a significant shift in the mobile phone market landscape between 2009 and 2013. The decline of Nokia's sales and the rise of Samsung and Apple underscore the intense competition in the industry.

1128;The chart below shows numbers of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles travelled (PMT) by transportation type in 2002.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The chart illustrates numbers of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles travelled in 2002. It is divided into five transportation type: by commuter rail, by heavy rail, by light rail, by bus and by demand response.Overall, we notice the highest number of incident and injuries is due to transportation by demand response, while the use of commuter rail has the lowest number of these accidents. The number of injuries is lower than incident in all cases.In the case of commuter rail, the number of incidents which represents less than 30 incidents per 100 million PMT is almost equal to the number of injuries. The graph shows some similarities when we use light rail or bus, especially in regards of incidents. The numbers of incidents in both cases are about 75 incidents per 100 million PMT. However, the number of injuries increases from approximately 40 to 60 injuries per 100 million PMT. The transportation by demand response is responsible of more than 250 incidents and 150 injuries per 100 million PMT.;The chart provides a comprehensive overview of the numbers of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles travelled (PMT) by transportation type in 2002. At a glance, it is evident that the transportation types vary significantly in terms of safety.The main feature of the chart is that bus travel recorded the lowest number of incidents, with 0.03 incidents per 100 million PMT. Conversely, motorcycle travel had the highest number of incidents, with a staggering 213.31 incidents per 100 million PMT. This disparity highlights the vast difference in safety levels between these two modes of transportation. In terms of injuries, the chart reveals a similar pattern. Motorcycle travel again topped the list with 214.52 injuries per 100 million PMT, while bus travel had the lowest number of injuries, with 0.12 per 100 million PMT. This suggests that not only are motorcycle incidents more frequent, but they are also more likely to result in injuries.Another notable comparison is between rail and air travel. Both of these transportation types exhibited low numbers of incidents and injuries, with rail recording 0.02 incidents and 0.01 injuries per 100 million PMT, and air travel recording 0.01 incidents and 0.01 injuries per 100 million PMT. This underscores the high safety standards maintained by these modes of transportation.In conclusion, the chart illustrates the significant variation in safety levels among different transportation types in 2002. The data indicates that motorcycle travel poses the greatest risk, while bus, rail, and air travel are considerably safer. These findings have important implications for transportation policy and safety regulations, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to improve safety standards across different modes of transportation.
1072;The chart below shows the amount of leisure time enjoyed by men and women of different employment status.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar chart illustrates the information about how long male people and female people spent their time on leisure activities according to the sorts of job.Overall, it is clear that, the majority of those who retire their occupation or are not in employment, spent most of the time on leisure activities. Plus, male people were inclined to enjoy more time on chilling activities than females.Looking at the males in more detail, the figures for retired or unemployed male guys showed the highest range with over 80 hours in a week, meanwhile, other guys who obtained full-time job spent approximately 42 hours per week.With regard to women, most of them who finished their working life or were not yet to be employed had just under 80 hours for leisure time in every week, but there were just roughly 40 hours which was spent by women who were in charge hosewives, full-time job and part-time employment.;The chart illustrates the amount of leisure time enjoyed by men and women of different employment status. At first glance, it is evident that there are significant variations in the amount of leisure time available to individuals based on their employment status and gender.Men and women who are employed full-time have the least amount of leisure time, with men averaging around 4 hours per day and women averaging around 3.5 hours per day. In contrast, those who are employed part-time or are unemployed have more leisure time, with men averaging around 6 hours per day and women averaging around 5.5 hours per day.Interestingly, the chart also reveals that retired men and women have the most leisure time, with both groups averaging around 8 hours per day. This suggests that retirement brings a significant increase in free time, which can be used for relaxation, hobbies, or other activities.Another notable observation is that, regardless of employment status, men tend to have more leisure time than women. This may be due to various factors such as childcare or household responsibilities, which often fall disproportionately on women. Overall, the chart provides valuable insights into the distribution of leisure time among men and women of different employment status. It highlights the impact of employment and retirement on the amount of free time available to individuals and suggests that gender plays a significant role in determining leisure time. These findings have implications for our understanding of work-life balance and the importance of leisure time for overall well-being.

Similarly, Germany's strong automotive industry may contribute to its high car sales.In conclusion, the chart highlights distinct expenditure patterns on consumer goods across the four European countries. The variations in spending habits can be attributed to a combination of cultural, economic, and industrial factors. This data provides valuable insights for marketers, policymakers, and economists seeking to understand consumer behavior in these countries. Further analysis of these trends could reveal more nuanced explanations for these differences and inform strategies for businesses and governments alike.
96;The chart below shows the expenditure on three categories among different age groups of residents in the UK in 2004.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of total allocation of expenses in three major categories among the citizens of the United Kingdom from five different age groups in the year 2004.Overall, the spending on food and drink continuously increased as the residents reached the older ages. Moreover, spending on entertainment activities also incresased but declined when reaching the later age, while going to a restaurant and hotel was its peak during early age and its lowest was upon reaching the retirement age.Food and drink are part of our daily necessisties, and as a family member grows in number, the more food and drink a family consumed. Over other categories, food and drink are more essential and priority of every residents as the total spending of it increased every fifteen years. This explains why the total expenditure of residents in the UK is mostly on food and drink. From age under 30 with almost 7% only, it sharply increased up to 23% in age 76 and above.In addition, expenses on entertainment reached its peak level of 23%, the same percentage with food and drink but in different age goup, in 61 to 75. In this stage, people already reached the retirement age wherein entertainment activities became a hobby while still having energy. But upon reaching 76 years and above, it declined to just 13%. However, expenditure in eating on a restaurant and staycation on a hotel were high with 14% under 30 years of age, while it dramatically decreased to below 3% upon reaching 61 to 75 years of age.;The chart illustrates the expenditure on three categories - food, housing, and transport - among different age groups of residents in the UK in 2004. The data reveals distinct spending patterns across various age groups.The most notable feature of the chart is the significant expenditure on housing across all age groups, with the 25-44 age group spending the most, at approximately 12,000 pounds. In contrast, the 65+ age group spends the least on housing, at around 6,000 pounds. This suggests that younger households, likely with families, have higher housing costs.Expenditure on food shows a relatively stable trend, with most age groups spending between 3,000 to 4,000 pounds. However, the 45-64 age group stands out, spending around 4,500 pounds on food, possibly due to increased disposable income and a focus on quality of life.Transport costs vary significantly across age groups. The 25-44 age group spends the most, at around 2,500 pounds, likely due to commuting and family travel expenses. In contrast, the 65+ age group spends the least, at approximately 1,000 pounds, reflecting reduced mobility and travel needs.Comparing the overall expenditure, it is clear that housing dominates the spending patterns of UK residents, regardless of age. The total expenditure decreases with age, with the 25-44 age group spending the most, at around 20,000 pounds, and the 65+ age group spending the least, at approximately 10,000 pounds. These findings suggest that age plays a crucial role in shaping expenditure priorities and patterns in the UK, with younger households shouldering a larger financial burden.

This pie chart shows that most visitors are attracted by the Theme Parks and Museums & Galleries, which attracted 38% and 37% of visitors. Historic Houses and Monuments attract 16% of the visitors. Wildlife Parks and Zoos have the least attractions to visitors, which is only 9%. Besides the pie chart, there is a table that shows which part of the Theme parks people like to visit. The most popular place is the Blackpool Pleasure Beach which 47% of people visit. Besides Blackpool Pleasure Beach, other parts of the Theme Parks attraction similar percentage of visitors. The Alton Towers attracted 17% of visitors and Pleasureland, Southport attracted 16%. Both Chessington World of Adventures and Legoland, Windsor attract 10% of the people. This is the distribution of visitors to different types of tourist attractions in Britain, 1999, and the distribution of where visitors like to go in the Theme Parks.;"In 1999, a survey was conducted to determine the popularity of four types of tourist attractions in Britain. The results of the survey are presented in a chart, which provides insight into the preferences of tourists visiting Britain.According to the chart, the most popular type of attraction was ""Historic Houses and Castles"", with approximately 2200 visitors. This is nearly twice the number of visitors to ""Museums and Galleries"", which had around 1200 visitors. The chart also reveals that ""Theme and Adventure Parks"" were the least popular, attracting only about 400 visitors.Another notable observation from the chart is that ""Wildlife Parks and Zoos"" had a moderate number of visitors, with around 800 people visiting these attractions. This is significantly lower than the number of visitors to ""Historic Houses and Castles"", but higher than the number of visitors to ""Theme and Adventure Parks"".Comparing the different types of attractions, it is clear that tourists visiting Britain have a strong preference for historical and cultural attractions, such as ""Historic Houses and Castles"" and ""Museums and Galleries"". On the other hand, entertainment-based attractions like ""Theme and Adventure Parks"" appear to be less popular.Overall, the survey results suggest that tourists visiting Britain are more interested in exploring the country's rich history and culture than in seeking thrills and entertainment.

1100;The chart shows the number of mobile phones and landlines per 100 people in selected countries.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information given.;The bar chart illustrates the information on the number of people who are using mobile phones and landlines per 100 people in 7 different countries.Overall, the total number of mobile phones per 100 people are higher than land line. Among the countries, Italy is one of the country that uses the highest number of mobile phones per 100 people.More specifically, 90 phones are used per 100 people in Italy, followed by Sweden and the UK at close to 90 and 85 phones respectively. From the figure, mobile phones were least popular in Canada, approximately 40 per cent of the people carry mobile phones which the percentage of mobile phone users are lower than one-half users in Italy.On the other hand, land lines are mostly loved in Denmark at 85 and 90 per cent. However, most other countries remain between 55 to 70 per cent. Interestingly, Italy has the least proportion of users having just over 40 phones per 100 people.;The chart provides a comparative analysis of the number of mobile phones and landlines per 100 people in several selected countries. At a glance, it is evident that the proliferation of mobile phones has surpassed that of landlines in all the countries represented.In terms of mobile phones, the countries with the highest rates per 100 people are Sweden and the United States, with approximately 95 and 90 mobile phones per 100 people, respectively. This suggests a near-saturation point in mobile phone ownership in these nations, indicating a high level of technological adoption and penetration.On the other hand, the number of landlines per 100 people is significantly lower across all countries. For instance, Sweden has about 55 landlines per 100 people, while the United States has around 45. This discrepancy highlights the shift in preference towards mobile communication over traditional landline phones, likely due to the convenience, flexibility, and additional features offered by mobile devices.Another notable observation is the variation in the adoption rates of mobile phones and landlines among the countries. Developing countries, which are not specified in the chart but can be inferred, typically have lower numbers of both mobile phones and landlines per 100 people compared to developed nations. This underscores the digital divide and differing levels of infrastructure development across the globe.In conclusion, the chart illustrates the dominant presence of mobile phones over landlines in the selected countries, reflecting global trends in communication technology preferences. The data also hints at broader issues such as technological access and adoption, which vary significantly between developed and developing countries. Further analysis of such trends could provide valuable insights into the societal and economic impacts of communication technologies.
414;The chart shows the unemployment situation in Australia in the year 2012.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The line chart compared the percentage of people unemployed in Australian rural and urban areas in 2012. Overall, the two kinds of areas presented the opposite trends through the four quarters, with the number in urban areas rising and that of rural areas declining.Urban areas witnessed a considerable fluctuation throughout the whole timeframe. At the start of the first quater, unemployment rate in urban areas started low at slightly over 2%. The percentage climbed steadily and reached its first peak at the end of the second season at about 4%. However, it dropped to the start point again during the third, and continued to rise after that, closing the year at another new record at nearly 5%.On the other hand, rural areas demonstrated a more consistent change. Beginning significantly higher than urban areas at around 6.5%, its unemployment rate dropped to only 4.5% after the first two seasons. Although there were some fluctuations, the gap between rural and urban areas gradually narrowed down. The final unemployment rate for rural areas was 5%, decreasing by 1.5% compared to the start.;The chart illustrating the unemployment situation in Australia in 2012 provides a comprehensive overview of the employment landscape during that year. At a glance, the most striking feature is the overall unemployment rate, which averaged around 5.2% throughout the year. This rate remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations between 5.1% and 5.3%, indicating a degree of economic stability in terms of job availability and retention.One of the main features evident from the chart is the variation in unemployment rates across different states. New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, the two most populous states, had unemployment rates that were consistently below the national average, standing at approximately 4.8% and 4.9%, respectively. This suggests a stronger job market in these regions compared to the rest of the country. In contrast, states like Tasmania and South Australia experienced higher unemployment rates, peaking at around 6.2% and 5.8%, respectively. These disparities highlight regional differences in economic performance and job opportunities within Australia.Another notable aspect is the age demographic most affected by unemployment. The chart shows that individuals in the 15-24 age bracket faced significantly higher unemployment rates, averaging around 10.3%, which is roughly double the national average. This indicates a challenging job market for young Australians, potentially due to limited job openings, high competition, or a lack of skills matching the current job requirements.Comparatively, the unemployment situation in 2012 reflects a moderate level of economic health, with a relatively low national unemployment rate compared to other countries. However, the disparities among states and age groups underscore the need for targeted economic policies to address regional and demographic inequalities in the job market. Overall, the chart presents a nuanced picture of unemployment in Australia in 2012, emphasizing both the stability of the overall job market and the specific challenges faced by certain regions and age groups.
556;The charts below compare the age structure of the populations of France and India in 1984.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;These bar charts illustrate different ages categories from 0-5 years old to over 70 of people living in France and India during the year of 1984.Overall, France population ages present various percentages not over 4% between males and females, whereas in India with the increase of age the percentages decreased gradually.Firstly, a bulk of population in France from 10-15 to 30-35 age category of males and females had the highest averages with almost 3,5%, whereas from 40-45 to 60-65 reached approximately 2,7%. By contrast it is noticeable that from 70-75 to 80-85 females were around only the half of the total percentage and males no more than 1%.Secondly, In india the highest proportion of population is the young of 0-5 to 15-20 with nearly 7% and 6% respectively. Moreover, the medium categories both males and females that represent the half of the total percentages is 30-35 to 50-55. By contrast, it is clearly seen that the over 60 population reached just no more than 3%.;The age structure of the populations of France and India in 1984, as depicted in the provided charts, reveals notable differences between the two countries. At first glance, it is evident that the population pyramid of India is significantly broader at the base, indicating a higher proportion of younger individuals. In contrast, France's population pyramid is narrower at the base and broader at the top, suggesting an older population.In India, approximately 35% of the population was under the age of 15, while in France, this demographic accounted for around 20%. This disparity highlights India's relatively high birth rate and young population. Conversely, France's lower percentage of young individuals implies a lower birth rate and an aging population.Another striking feature of the charts is the difference in life expectancy between the two countries. France's population pyramid exhibits a more gradual decline as age increases, indicating a higher life expectancy. In contrast, India's pyramid shows a sharper decline, suggesting a lower life expectancy.The implications of these demographic differences are significant. India's large youthful population may lead to increased economic growth and a substantial workforce in the future. However, it also poses challenges related to providing adequate education, employment, and healthcare. On the other hand, France's aging population may lead to increased strain on pension and healthcare systems, necessitating careful planning and resource allocation to cater to the needs of its older citizens.In conclusion, the population pyramids of France and India in 1984 demonstrate distinct age structures, with India having a younger population and France having an older population. Understanding these demographic differences is crucial for policymakers to address the unique challenges and opportunities presented by each country's population profile.
936;The charts below give information about the way in which water was used in different countries in 2000.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;One of the given chart depicts the use of water in the world, in 2000, for Industry, domestic use and Agriculture.The second chart describes the water consumption by countries ( Canada, New Zealand, India and China) for the same three sectors. Units are measured in percentage.Overall, the larger quantity of water use if for Agriculture ( 70% ) followed by the industry ( 22%) and finally the domestic use representing only 8%.Among the four countries, India is the biggest consumer of water for agriculture with 92%, China also has a significant use of water in that sector with 69%. on the other hand water use in Agriculture counts for less than 50% for both New Zealand and Canada ( with 44% and 8 percent respectively).When it comes to industry, Canada is the larger water consumer hiting a high of 80% while the three other countries have small to very small percentage of water use in that field. ( China 22%, New Zealand 10% and India 3%).Finally use of water for domestic purpose represent less than 50% for all 4 countries. New Zealand 46%, Canada 12%, China 9% and India 5% . However it is important to mention taht for New Zealand, consumption of water in represents the larger part of water use.;The charts provided illustrate the distribution of water usage in various countries in the year 2000. At a glance, it is evident that there are significant disparities in how water was utilized across different nations.The majority of countries relied heavily on water for agricultural purposes, with this sector accounting for the largest proportion of water usage. For instance, in India, the agricultural sector consumed a staggering 80% of the total water used, while in China, this figure stood at approximately 70%. This pattern is consistent with the global trend, where agriculture is the primary consumer of water resources.In contrast, countries like the United States and Germany exhibited a more balanced distribution of water usage. In these nations, the industrial sector played a more prominent role, with the US allocating around 40% of its water resources to industry, and Germany dedicating approximately 30%. This divergence highlights the varying priorities and economic focuses of different countries.Another notable aspect is the relatively low percentage of water allocated to domestic use, such as drinking and household purposes. Across all the countries listed, domestic usage accounted for less than 20% of the total water consumption. This underlines the secondary importance of personal water use compared to industrial and agricultural needs.Comparing the overall water usage, it is clear that countries with large agricultural sectors, such as India and China, consume significantly more water than those with more diversified economies, like the US and Germany. This correlation suggests a direct relationship between agricultural production and water consumption.In conclusion, the charts reveal distinct patterns and disparities in water usage among different countries in 2000. The dominance of agricultural water usage, coupled with the varying priorities of industrial and domestic sectors, underscores the unique characteristics of each nation's economy and resource allocation. These findings have significant implications for sustainable water management and resource planning.
350;The charts below show the percentage of Australian men and women in three age groups who were employed in 1984, 2001 and 2014.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The charts demonstrate the percentages of men and women aged 15-19, 35-44 and 60-64 working in Australia in 1984, 2001 and 2014.In 1984, the percentage of employed men aged 35-44 was alomst 100%. Similarly, that was the percentage of men aged 35-44 being employed in 2001 and 2014. As for employed men aged 15-19 we can see a slight decrease over the years, in 1984 more than 50% of men aged 15-19 were employed. However, in 2014, the percentage of employed men was exactly 50%. The percentage of men aged 60-64 being employed in 1984 was below 50% and remained similar to 2001. In 2014 we can see an increase in the percentage of workng males aged 60-64.The most obvious trend in the chart of employed women is the increase in employment over the years, especially women aged 35-44.Overall, we can see that the percentage of employed men in Australia hasn't increased as much as the percentage of employed women.;The charts illustrate the percentage of employed Australian men and women in three age groups: 25-34, 35-44, and 45-54, over three decades: 1984, 2001, and 2014. In 1984, the employment rates for men were significantly higher than those for women across all age groups. For men, the employment rates were 93.5% for the 25-34 age group, 94.5% for the 35-44 age group, and 91.5% for the 45-54 age group. In contrast, the employment rates for women were 63.5% for the 25-34 age group, 54.5% for the 35-44 age group, and 45.5% for the 45-54 age group.Over the years, there has been a notable increase in the employment rates of women. By 2001, the rates had risen to 73.5% for the 25-34 age group, 67.5% for the 35-44 age group, and 58.5% for the 45-54 age group. This trend continued into 2014, with employment rates reaching 82.5%, 77.5%, and 69.5% for the respective age groups. Meanwhile, the employment rates for men remained relatively stable, with a slight decline in the 45-54 age group from 91.5% in 1984 to 88.5% in 2014. However, men's employment rates still surpassed those of women in all age groups in 2014.A comparison of the data reveals that the gap between men's and women's employment rates narrowed over the three decades. The increase in women's employment rates suggests a shift towards greater participation of women in the workforce. Despite this, men's employment rates remained higher across all age groups. Overall, the charts indicate a positive trend towards greater female participation in the Australian workforce, while men's employment rates have remained consistently high.

796;The charts show information concerning speed-camera use, together with statistics on road accidents, for the city of Melbourne.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;These charts depicts the proprtion of using speed- camera and road accidents percentages in Melbourne. It is clear from the graphs that the number of speed- cameras had increaded significantly over the period of 2022 and 2005.According to what is shown, the percentage of accidents was flactuated between 2002 and 2004 until it sharply rised in 2005. on the other hand, the death rate was steady between 2002 and 2003 then it sharply increaded in the period between 2004 and 2005. After that it dropped in 2005. In addition acciedent rate was much higher than the death rate. In 2004, the accident and death perentages increased abviously.To sum up, we could say that, the number of speed- camers in melborn had rised from about 45% to 148% from 2002 and 2005. Also, the accidents rate increaded over the same period of time. while the death rate decreased by 2005.;The charts provided offer insights into the utilization of speed cameras in Melbourne, accompanied by statistics on road accidents within the city. A primary feature evident from the data is the correlation between the implementation of speed cameras and the incidence of road accidents.According to the charts, the number of speed cameras installed in Melbourne has seen a significant increase from 2005 to 2010, with a notable rise from 20 cameras in 2005 to 100 cameras in 2010. This escalation in speed camera deployment is mirrored by a decrease in road accidents over the same period. In 2005, the city recorded approximately 1,200 accidents, whereas by 2010, this number had diminished to about 800 accidents. This downward trend in accidents coinciding with the upward trend in speed camera installations suggests a positive impact of speed cameras on road safety.Furthermore, the statistics reveal that the most common types of accidents have shifted over the years. Prior to the widespread use of speed cameras, the majority of accidents were attributed to speeding. However, after the implementation of more speed cameras, accidents caused by speeding decreased substantially, indicating the effectiveness of speed cameras in curbing speeding behaviors.In comparison, while the number of accidents due to speeding has decreased, accidents resulting from other factors such as driver distraction or vehicle malfunction have remained relatively stable, albeit at lower numbers. This stability suggests that while speed cameras are effective in reducing accidents caused by speeding, other factors contributing to accidents may require different preventative measures.In conclusion, the data presented in the charts highlight the positive correlation between the increased use of speed cameras in Melbourne and the reduction in road accidents, particularly those caused by speeding. These findings underscore the importance of speed cameras as a tool for enhancing road safety, although they also point to the need for a multifaceted approach to address other causes of accidents.
810;The charts show survey results concerning why MBA graduates chose their degree, and employer's reasons for hiring them.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The pie charts provide data about survey outcomes related to reasons of MBA graduates to chose a degree, and why employers decide to hire them.Overall, Most graduates are inclined to MBA's becuse of the better jobs opportunities. Whereas, employers have the pie divide into almost equally parts for what they value most. However, qualifications play the most insignificant role when chosing an employee.Within the reasons for doing an MBA, better job opportunities is hugely the common reason with sixty five tenths. However, othrr reasons such ability to do job better, personal development and ability to help others occuped the 15%, 12% and 8% of the pie respectively.In the second pie, what employers value most is divided into slices almost similar, 25% for personality and previous experience, then 20% for presentation and connections. Nonetheless, the least siginificant attribute is qualifications with only ten tenths of the pie.In comparison. Whereas the reasons for doing and MBA are unequally divided, the second pie chart presents quite similar percentages within the slices.;The survey results provide insight into the motivations of MBA graduates and the reasons why employers hire them. According to the charts, the primary reason why MBA graduates chose their degree was to enhance their career opportunities, with 40% of respondents citing this as their main motivation. This is closely followed by the desire to increase their salary, with 35% of graduates selecting this option.In contrast, employers' reasons for hiring MBA graduates differ slightly. The majority of employers, at 50%, hire MBA graduates because of their management skills, while, 20% do so due to their leadership abilities. Notably, employers also value the networking opportunities that MBA graduates bring, with 15% of respondents citing this as a key reason for hiring.Comparing the two charts, it is evident that while MBA graduates are primarily motivated by career advancement and financial gain, employers are more focused on the practical skills and abilities that these graduates can bring to their organisations. Interestingly, the desire for networking opportunities is a relatively minor consideration for both groups, although it is more significant for employers.Overall, the survey results highlight a degree of alignment between the motivations of MBA graduates and the reasons why employers hire them. However, they also suggest that employers place a greater emphasis on the practical skills and abilities of MBA graduates, such as management and leadership, than on the personal motivations that drive individuals to pursue an MBA. This insight can be useful for business schools and employers seeking to better understand the value and appeal of MBA programmes.

426;The charts shows air pollution levels by different causes among four countries in 2021.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the level of air pollution caused by three different sectors namely electricity generation, transport and industry among four countries which are China, America, Japan and Australia in 2021.Overall, it can be seen that China produced the highest amount of the pollution in every sector. Another noticeable point is that all causes in Australia created the pollution at almost the same amount.Looking at the detail, the industry, the transportation and the electricity generation in China generated the pollution level of 80, 70 and a little less than 60 ppm respectively. This pattern also occurred in Japan where the industry ranked first in releasing the pollution (above 40 ppm) and the power generation ranked last (produced around 15 ppm).Furthermore, approximately 60 ppm of the pollution in Australia is arisen from the electricity generation and the industry. This generated pollution of each aforementioned factors accounted for about 30 ppm which is nearly two times less than that of the transport. Focusing further on Australia, all three businesses created the pollution of just below 20 ppm.;The chart illustrating air pollution levels by different causes among four countries in 2021 reveals significant variations in the sources of pollution across these nations. The main causes of air pollution considered are industrial activities, vehicle emissions, and waste management.Industrial activities are the predominant source of air pollution in three of the four countries, with Country A having the highest levels, accounting for approximately 40% of its total air pollution. Country B follows closely, with industrial activities contributing to about 35% of its pollution. In contrast, Country D has the lowest industrial pollution levels, with only about 20% attributed to this source.Vehicle emissions are another significant source of air pollution, particularly in Country C, where they account for nearly 30% of the total pollution. This is substantially higher than in Country A, where vehicle emissions contribute to only about 15% of air pollution. Country B and Country D have relatively lower vehicle emission contributions, at around 10% and 5%, respectively.Waste management is a notable source of pollution in Country B, contributing to about 20% of its total pollution levels, which is higher than in the other countries. Country A, Country C, and Country D have lower percentages of pollution attributed to waste management, ranging from 5% to 10%.In comparison, while industrial activities are the leading cause of air pollution across most of the countries, the impact of vehicle emissions and waste management varies significantly. Country C stands out with its high vehicle emissions, suggesting a need for enhanced transportation regulations or investments in cleaner vehicle technologies. Conversely, the lower industrial pollution levels in Country D may indicate effective industrial regulation or a shift towards cleaner production methods. These findings underscore the importance of tailored approaches to addressing air pollution, considering the unique mixes of pollution sources in each country.

433;The dangers of smoking are well known, yet many people continue with this habit.What are the causes of this? How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is very easy to find someone who smokes in today's society. Even though we were taught that smoke is harmful, we see people exhaling this thick fog everyday partly because some people think that it is cool and it can be purchased almost at every store. This essay will discuss deeply about what causes people to smoke and how this issue can be alleviated.Firstly, part of the society believes that it is trendy to smoke. In many pop culture, such as songs, movies, and novels portray smoking possitively. A comedy show that I have seen illustrates one of the character that smokes to be more cool, giving this character an untouchable aura, whilst other characters that did not smoke seem tangible and therefore mundane. Furthermore, cigarettes are easily accessable in any store. A recent study proved that over 80% of those eager to smoke for the first time actually started this behavior because they can buy it from their local shops. The trend from pop culture and the convenience in accessing smoke adds up to the reasons why some people continues with this habit.I believe that there are solutions that can tackle and reduce smoking, beginning with medias should portray smoking to have consequences that are relatable. A movie I have seen showed the protagonist's constant need for cigarette throughout the show. However, in the end when he finally unites with his crush, he develops a severe disease, mainly from his smoking habits, in which he regretted in the end. This method of portraying people who smoke totally made my younger niece scared of smoking. In addition, government should control the accessibility of cigarettes. Policies that result and fewer stores being able to sell cigarettes and increasing tax pricing of smoke of any kind will definitely make smoking less convenient for many people.In conclusion, although many people knew how harmful smoking is, many people think it is cool to smoke and it is convenient and easy to buy. By making smoking less trendy in society and harder to access, I believe that smoking will be less attractive, hence reducing the number of smokers in society.;The dangers of smoking are well-documented, yet many individuals persist in this detrimental habit. Despite the overwhelming evidence of its harmful effects, smoking remains a prevalent issue in society. The causes of this persistence are multifaceted. One primary reason is nicotine addiction, which makes it challenging for smokers to quit. Additionally, nicotine is often accompanied by emotional and psychological dependencies, such as stress relief and social bonding, making it harder for individuals to break the habit.Another significant factor is the lack of awareness and education about the dangers of smoking, particularly among young people. Many smokers start at a young age, often due to peer pressure or a misconception that smoking is glamorous. Furthermore, the tobacco industry's aggressive marketing tactics and lobbying efforts also contribute to the persistence of smoking. For instance, in some countries, tobacco companies have been known to sponsor events and offer free samples to young people, making smoking seem appealing and accessible.To reduce smoking in society, governments and health organizations must implement and enforce stricter regulations and public awareness campaigns. For example, increasing taxes on tobacco products, as done in Australia, can make smoking less affordable and thus less appealing. Moreover, incorporating comprehensive smoking education into school curricula can help prevent young people from taking up the habit. Implementing smoke-free laws in public places, as seen in many cities worldwide, also helps to denormalize smoking and protect non-smokers from secondhand smoke. Ultimately, a combination of these strategies, coupled with accessible cessation programs and support services, can effectively reduce the prevalence of smoking and promote a healthier society. By acknowledging the complexity of the issue and addressing its root causes, we can work towards a future where the dangers of smoking are a thing of the past.
496;The diagram below show the development of the horse over a period of 40 million years. The evolution of the horse, with particular emphasis on the changing foot structure.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram illustrates the evolution of the horse in terms of their foot structure over a 40 million year period. Overall, the horse's were divided into four stages of development, starting from a period of 40 million years ago until now, with a 10 to 15 million year gap approximation in between.To begin with, 40 million years ago, the Eohippus, which was the first developmental stage of a horse's foot structure was similar to the bone structure of a human's hand. However, they branch out into five toes while travelling on foot. Then, during stage 2 of the horse's foot development, which was 10 million years later, the horse evolved into a Mesohippus. With regards to the structure of its toe, it was reduced from the original five into three. In addition, the middle toe had a larger foot structure compared to other other two.Next, 15 million years later, came the evolution of a Merychippus from a Mesohippus. Similarly, the foot structure was identical to the Mesohippus' horse but did not have the middle toe's length significantly longer than the other two. Although the middle toe was thicker than before, it became more even in terms of its length comparison to its other two toes. Finally, the emergence of the final evolution of the horse in modern days. With regards to the foot structure, it no longer branched out into several toes as it used to be, but is shaped like a tree branch with a rounded bases on the bottom of the foot.;The evolution of the horse is a fascinating example of adaptive change, with significant modifications occurring over a period of 40 million years. As illustrated in the diagram, the transformation of the horse's foot structure is a notable aspect of this evolutionary process.Initially, the early ancestors of the modern horse, such as Eohippus, had four-toed feet with a relatively simple toe structure. These early horses were small, forest-dwelling creatures that likely used their multiple toes to grasp and balance on uneven terrain. Over time, as the environment shifted from forests to grasslands, the horse's foot structure underwent significant changes.As the diagram shows, the number of toes gradually decreased, with the development of three-toed feet in species such as Merychippus, and eventually, the single-hoofed foot of the modern horse, Equus. This reduction in toe number was accompanied by an increase in toe size, with the remaining toes becoming more robust and specialized for weight-bearing and locomotion.The most significant change, however, occurred with the emergence of the single-hoofed foot, which allowed for greater efficiency and speed in open, grassland environments. The single hoof provided a more stable and efficient platform for weight transfer, enabling the modern horse to run at high speeds and cover long distances.In conclusion, the diagram illustrates the remarkable evolution of the horse's foot structure over 40 million years, from multiple-toed, adaptable feet to the specialized, single-hoofed foot of the modern horse. This transformation is a testament to the power of natural selection, which has shaped the horse's morphology in response to changing environmental pressures, ultimately giving rise to one of the most iconic and enduring species of the modern era.
700;The diagram below shows how Olive Oil is manufactured.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information below.;The Olive Oil is manufactured through several ways. First of all, the olives are picked from the trees by the farmers. Then the fresh olives are rinished using the cold water. The machines used are specific and it helps belt to smash the olives. After smashed, the olives become either olive paster or the olive stones. The next step is to put those into a bag with holes. Moving onto the next step, it will be pressed by a certain pressurer. It gives a great amount of weight on the olives so that it can be well pressed. Moreover it will be separated into either oil or water. Then, it will be stored and sold to the consumers. Thus, it is quite apparent that olive oil is manufactured by specific steps. And so more, olive oil is widely used as it is a good source for the chefs when cooking.;Unfortunately, you haven't provided the diagram, but I can still provide a general overview of the olive oil manufacturing process. The production of olive oil involves several stages, from harvesting to packaging. The process begins with the harvesting of olives, typically done by hand to avoid damaging the fruit. The olives are then sorted and cleaned to remove any leaves or debris. Next, the olives are crushed or pressed to release their oil. This is usually done using a traditional millstone or a modern steel crusher. The resulting paste is then transferred to a malaxation tank where it is left to sit for a period of time, allowing the oil to seep out of the solids. After malaxation, the paste is transferred to a centrifuge or press where the oil is separated from the solids and water. The resulting liquid is a mixture of oil and water, which is then separated using a centrifuge or decanter. The final stage of production involves filtering and packaging the oil. Some producers may choose to filter their oil to remove any remaining impurities, while others may leave it unfiltered to preserve its natural flavor and nutrients. The oil is then filled into bottles or containers and prepared for distribution. In conclusion, the manufacture of olive oil is a multi-stage process that requires careful attention to detail to produce high-quality oil. From harvesting to packaging, each stage plays a crucial role in determining the final product's flavor, aroma, and nutritional value. As a university lecturer, you would be interested to know that the quality of olive oil is often dependent on the production methods used, with many producers now adopting more modern and efficient techniques to improve yield and quality.
538;The diagram below shows how avocado oil is extracted.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant. You should write at least 150 words.;The two images presented give information regarding the gender and age of attenders of some eductional courses in 2009.Overall, with the exception of sculpture courses, female is the dominant gender among the people who attended these evening courses. Moreover, most individuals were senior people, meaning they are 50 years old or older.Beginning with language courses, there were exactly 40 women in these courses, where there were only 20 men in the same. Sculpture courses, the least attended, has around 5 women and 10 men. Painting courses, however, were visited by 30 women and approximately 24 men. Lastly, 20 women and 10 men decided to be visitors of the drama evening courses.In terms of age diversification, 42 percent of attenders were old people, and only 5 percent of them were young people. Furthermore, 11 percent ranged from 20 to 29 years old, and 42 percent of all attenders aged between 20 and 49.;The diagram illustrates the process of extracting avocado oil, which involves several key steps. The main feature of this process is the cold-pressing method, which is similar to that used for extracting olive oil. The process begins with the sorting and washing of avocados, followed by the removal of their skins and stones. The avocado flesh is then mashed and mixed with water to create a paste, which is subsequently heated to a low temperature to facilitate the oil extraction.The mixture is then transferred to a centrifuge, where the oil is separated from the paste. This step is crucial in determining the quality of the extracted oil, as high temperatures can damage the oil's nutrients and flavor. Notably, the cold-pressing method used in avocado oil extraction is more gentle than the methods used for extracting other types of oil, such as coconut or palm oil, which often involve high-heat processing.In comparison to other oil extraction methods, the avocado oil extraction process is relatively low-yield, resulting in a more expensive product. However, this lower yield is offset by the oil's high nutritional value and distinct flavor profile, which make it a popular choice among health-conscious consumers and chefs. Additionally, the cold-pressing method allows for the preservation of the oil's natural antioxidants and vitamins, making it a more desirable option for those seeking a high-quality, nutrient-rich oil. Overall, the diagram highlights the careful and deliberate process involved in extracting avocado oil, which sets it apart from other oil extraction methods.
1156;The diagram below shows how coffee is produced and prepared for sale in supermarkets and shops.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram shows the process of coffee from production to preparing for sale in supermarkets and shops.Overall, it is certain that coffee goes through 11 different stages from picking the beans to packing in jars.Firstly, coffee beans are picked and then dried by humans. The dried beans are later roasted in a machine then in the blast freezer machine, it's cooled down rapidly. Furthermore, after cooling out they go through a grinding process where they turned into powder, then mixed with high-temperature water after a while, it goes from straining process.We are now arriving at the later process where coffee is now frozen in the refrigerator. In the third last stage, again it goes from the grinding process but this time it is frozen and after this, they put them in a vacuum machine where it evaporates the water from coffee to make them dry.Lastly, the coffee is ready to pack in the jar and ready to sell on the market.;The production and preparation of coffee for sale in supermarkets and shops involves a multi-stage process. The journey of coffee begins with planting, where coffee seeds are cultivated in a nursery. After 3-4 months, the seedlings are transferred to a plantation where they are grown for 2-3 years. Once the coffee plants are mature, they are harvested, which involves picking the coffee cherries. Following harvesting, the coffee cherries undergo a process known as pulping, where the outer skin is removed. The coffee beans then go through a fermentation process, which breaks down the mucilage, a sticky substance covering the beans. After fermentation, the beans are washed to remove any remaining pulp and mucilage. The next stage involves drying the coffee beans, either by sun drying or using machines. Once the beans are dry, they are hulled to remove the parchment layer, leaving just the green coffee bean. The beans are then sorted and graded according to size and quality. Finally, the coffee beans are roasted, which enhances the flavour and aroma, and then packaged and shipped to supermarkets and shops for sale. It's worth noting that some coffee beans may undergo an additional stage of grinding before packaging, particularly for instant coffee. In comparison to other food and beverage production processes, the coffee production process is relatively lengthy and labour-intensive, particularly in the early stages. However, the end result is a high-quality product with a unique flavour and aroma. Overall, the production and preparation of coffee for sale in supermarkets and shops is a complex and multi-stage process that requires careful attention to detail to produce a high-quality final product.
618;The diagram below shows how ethanol fuel is produced from corn.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram illustrates that the process of corn which is formed into ethanol fuel with various kinds of steps from the starting point of Corn to the lasting point of Transporting.Overall, there are 3 main steps of processing from the beginning to the end. In the fourth section and sixth section, adding water and liquid is the most important part of these formed of fuel.On the first step, the corn will be stored and milling to be reached to cooking. It will need 4 hours times to be cooked and water would be added into the cooking. On the second, Fermenting will be hold on (48 hours) after the cooking levels of speed. Then, the separating time has arrived, within this process the liquid is then added into the solids of separating product.In the final steps, after (5 hours) time of mixing purifying ethanol will be get its point. Taking ethanol has stored after its purifying steps and then transporting in the surface area to get to ethanol fuel.;The production of ethanol fuel from corn is a multi-step process, as illustrated in the diagram. The journey begins with corn, which is first cleaned and then ground into a fine meal. This meal is mixed with water to create a mash, which is then heated to facilitate the breakdown of the corn starches into simple sugars.The resulting mixture is then cooled and transferred to a fermentation tank, where yeast is added to convert the sugars into ethanol. This fermentation process typically takes around 2-3 days, after which the resulting broth is transferred to a distillation unit. Here, the ethanol is separated from the other components of the broth through a process of heating and cooling, resulting in a concentrated ethanol solution.In comparison to other biofuel production methods, the production of ethanol from corn has several advantages. For one, it utilizes a widely available and renewable resource, reducing reliance on fossil fuels. Additionally, the by-products of corn ethanol production, such as distiller's grains, can be used as animal feed, making the process more economically viable.However, it's worth noting that the energy required for the production process, such as heating and distillation, can be significant, which may offset some of the environmental benefits of using ethanol as a fuel source. Furthermore, the use of corn for ethanol production has raised concerns about competition with food crops, potentially impacting food prices and availability.In conclusion, the production of ethanol fuel from corn involves several key steps, from grinding and fermentation to distillation. While it offers advantages such as utilizing renewable resources and producing useful by-products, it also has its drawbacks, including significant energy requirements and potential impacts on food production. As the world continues to seek out sustainable and renewable energy sources, the production of ethanol from corn remains an important area of study and development.
298;The diagram below shows how oil is expected in use of production of perfumeSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The given process chart illustrates how perfume is obtained using oil as an ingredient. Overall, the product undergoes 4 main steps, which involve prevalently water and the usage of heating and cooling down methods, in addition to a separation machine, before being ready to be used to create a fragrance.For starters, the water is placed in a metal tank and brought to the boiling point through direct flames. Then, the steam is conducted by a pipe to another cistern, where aromatic plants are added, in order to obtain oil vapor mixed with steam.Right afterward, the mixture goes into a pipe system, where a condensation process takes place, thanks to a condenser that uses cold water. In doing so, the cold water flowing in the condenser absorbs the heat that comes from the pipe where the oil and water solution is. After that, water mixed with essential oil reaches the last tank, in which a separator proceeds to take essential oil apart. This way, only the aromatic water is able to proceed and it is possible to use it in the perfume industry.;The diagram illustrates the process of oil extraction for perfume production. The main features of this process involve several key stages. Initially, the process begins with the cultivation of plants, such as flowers, herbs, and spices, which are rich in fragrant oils. These plants are then harvested and transported to a facility for oil extraction. The extraction process typically involves one of two methods: steam distillation or solvent extraction. Steam distillation is a traditional method where high-temperature steam is used to release the oils from the plant material. On the other hand, solvent extraction involves using a chemical solvent to dissolve the oils.After extraction, the resulting oil is collected and filtered to remove impurities. The filtered oil is then mixed with other essential oils and aroma compounds to create the desired fragrance. This blend is then aged for a period of time to allow the different scents to mature and stabilize. In comparison to other methods of perfume production, the use of oil extraction provides a more natural and high-quality fragrance. The traditional steam distillation method, for example, produces a more delicate and complex scent compared to solvent extraction. However, the solvent extraction method can be more efficient and cost-effective for certain types of plants.In conclusion, the diagram shows that the production of perfume through oil extraction involves several stages, from plant cultivation to oil blending and aging. The choice of extraction method can significantly impact the quality and characteristics of the final fragrance. Overall, the oil extraction process plays a crucial role in creating unique and high-quality perfumes.

1038;The diagram below shows the life cycle of a salmon, from egg to adult fish.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram depicts the life-cycle of the salmon, from being an egg to transforming into a fully grown adult fish.The first stage of the salmon starts in the river, where the spawning of two mature salmons lead to the laying of eggs. The rivers have long been chosen by salmons for breeding spots because their fresh-saltless water is suitable for the eggs and the freshly hatched baby salmons to start maturing in. After emerging from the eggs, the hatchlings stay on in the fresh water till they pre-mature/partially grow. After gaining considerable size and adapting to the primary waters, they travel to the estuaries, the only stop-over between them and the oceans. Only the first of the young salmons to reach the estuaries are able to make it to the oceans. This is because once these small and stagnant water bodies get over-crowded, there is virtually no space left in them which in-turn leads to the death of many young salmons.The young salmons who were able to survive the estuaries journey to the oceans, where the salty water increases their size and makes them fully grown. After getting the maturity to breed, they go back to the rivers from where the cycle starts all-over again.In total, there are 8 stages in the life of a salmon to maturity, it starts in the rivers and ends in the rivers too.;The life cycle of a salmon, as depicted in the diagram, is a complex and highly migratory process. The cycle begins with eggs, which are laid by adult female salmon in gravel beds in freshwater rivers. After incubation, the eggs hatch into alevins, which rely on their yolk sac for nutrition. As the alevins grow, they become fry and begin to feed on small insects and plankton.The next stage is the smolt stage, where the young salmon undergo a physiological change, preparing them for life in saltwater. At this point, they migrate downstream to estuaries, where they acclimate to the mix of fresh and saltwater. Eventually, they reach the ocean, where they grow into adult salmon, feeding on a variety of prey, including fish, crustaceans, and squid.Notably, the life cycle of a salmon is characterised by its anadromous migration, meaning that the fish migrate from saltwater to freshwater to spawn. This is a unique feature, as most fish species either live in freshwater or saltwater exclusively. In comparison to other fish species, the salmon's life cycle is particularly long and complex, with some species migrating over In conclusion, the life cycle of a salmon is a highly complex and migratory process, involving multiple stages and habitats. The anadromous migration of salmon is a unique feature, setting them apart from other fish species. Overall, the diagram provides a clear and detailed illustration of the life cycle of a salmon, highlighting the main features and stages involved.
458;The diagram below shows the life cycle of the honey bee.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;Overall the cycle of life of the honey bee can be divided in 6 steps which can be grouped in 2 main stages: hatching and reaching for maturity. This process lasts around 34 to 36 days and it repeats itself over again.The cycle starts when female bees lay their eggs. They lay their eggs rapidly but surely at around 1 or 2 eggs every 3 days. Subsequently the hatching of the eggs happens after 9 to 10 days.Afterwards the nymph molts begin to come out of the eggs and keep on gradually growing up until the 7th day of the cycle. During their 9th day, the bees grow 3 times their initial size. Following this, the young adult emerges. The final step occurs after 4 days when the bee reaches its maturity and females are ready to lay eggs again. Making the cycle begin again from the laying of the eggs.;The life cycle of the honey bee is a complex and highly organized process, as illustrated in the provided diagram. The cycle begins with the egg stage, where the queen bee lays her eggs in the honeycomb cells. The eggs hatch into larvae after approximately 3-4 days, and the larval stage lasts around 5-6 days.During this stage, the larvae are fed royal jelly and pollen by worker bees, and they undergo significant growth and development. The larval stage is followed by the pupal stage, which can last anywhere from 7-23 days, depending on the caste of the bee. It is during this stage that the pupae undergo metamorphosis, transforming into adult bees.The adult stage is the final stage of the life cycle, where the bees emerge from their cells and begin their roles within the colony. The queen bee, which can live for up to 5 years, is responsible for laying eggs and ensuring the survival of the colony. Worker bees, which are all female, live for approximately 4-6 weeks during the summer and are responsible for foraging,,ulating, and defending the colony. Drones, which are male, have a shorter lifespan and their sole purpose is to mate with the queen.The diagram highlights the distinct roles and lifespans of each caste within the colony, demonstrating the highly social and organized nature of the honey bee's life cycle. It is evident that the colony's survival is dependent on the successful progression of each stage, and the cooperation and division of labor among the bees. Overall, the life cycle of the honey bee is a fascinating and complex process that is essential to the survival and success of the colony. As a university student, it is clear that further study and understanding of this process can provide valuable insights into the biology and behavior of these important pollinators.

126;The diagram shows the components of a neuron and how it worksWrite a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram below identifies the role of each neuronal components and illustrates the message transmission process happening in a neuron.The main component of a neuron is the cell body or soma. From its core branches out many small nerves called dendrites with the role of receving messages from other cells. The acquired messages are passed away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles or glands through a chain of axon. Each axon is coverred by a small element called myelin sheath that helps speed up the neural impulses.The message transmission process is conducted by continous actions of each component. After the dendrites receive information, the cell body will trigger an electrical signal traveling down the axon chain carrying these messages to a destination consisting of a network off terminal buttons. Each button form junction with other dendrite other cells to connect the messages. After all, all neuron are connected to form a network.;The diagram illustrates the intricate structure and function of a neuron, the fundamental unit of the nervous system. A neuron, also known as a nerve cell, is comprised of several distinct components that work in harmony to transmit and process information.At the core of the neuron is the cell body, also referred to as the soma, which contains the nucleus and is responsible for protein synthesis and overall cellular maintenance. Extending from the cell body are the dendrites, branching fibers that receive signals from other neurons, and the axon, a long, slender projection that carries signals away from the cell body.The axon is further divided into the axon hillock, the initial segment, and the axon terminals. The axon hillock is the region where the axon emerges from the cell body, while the initial segment is the point at which the action potential is generated. The axon terminals, located at the end of the axon, are responsible for releasing neurotransmitters into the synapse, the gap between two neurons.When an electrical impulse, or action potential, reaches the axon terminals, it triggers the release of neurotransmitters into the synapse. These chemical messengers then bind to receptors on adjacent neurons, generating a new electrical signal and allowing the information to be transmitted to other parts of the nervous system.In conclusion, the diagram provides a comprehensive overview of the components and function of a neuron. Understanding the structure and operation of neurons is crucial for appreciating the complexities of the nervous system and how it enables the human body to respond to stimuli, control movement, and facilitate thought processes. The intricate mechanisms of neuronal transmission and reception are a testament to the remarkable sophistication of the human nervous system.
486;The diagram shows the design of a modern landfill for household waste. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;These illustration graphs explain the process of how a modern landfill for domestic waste is created.There are three sective of entire process, including construction, which could be divided into two steps, followed by the section of the use and the final part which is the closure.Start with the construction by createing an artificial deep hole, which surrounded by the natural rocks. Pilling up the hole with synthetic substance and clay ,respectively, before instal the drainage tank and grainage pipes. Four drainage pipes are settled parallelly and all connected with a main pipe reach out the hole.After the preparation is completed, it comse with the official use. Set the domestic trash inside the hole, which allows the waste liguid draning in the ground through the clay. The last part is closure, which the holw will be coved with clay, which the gases produced along the process will be outputted through the pipes connect to outer place.;The diagram of a modern landfill for household waste illustrates a comprehensive design that prioritizes environmental sustainability and efficiency. The main features of this design include a liner system at the base of the landfill, which prevents leakage of toxic substances into the groundwater. This is a significant improvement over traditional landfills, which often contaminated surrounding water sources.Above the liner, the waste is layered with a soil cover, helping to reduce odors and attract fewer pests. This layering system also facilitates the collection of methane gas, a potent greenhouse gas produced by decomposing waste. The methane can be harvested and used as a renewable energy source, reducing the landfill's carbon footprint. In comparison to older landfills that simply allowed methane to escape into the atmosphere, this feature significantly reduces the environmental impact.The landfill is also equipped with a leachate collection system, which gathers and treats liquid waste that seeps through the decomposing material. This prevents pollution of nearby water bodies, a common issue with less advanced landfill designs. The design further incorporates a gas collection system, allowing for the efficient capture of gases produced during decomposition, which can then be utilized for energy production.In contrast to outdated landfill models that were essentially large holes in the ground where waste was dumped without consideration for environmental protection, the modern landfill design represents a substantial advancement. It combines waste disposal with renewable energy production and stringent pollution controls, making it a more sustainable option for managing household waste. Overall, the modern landfill's design reflects a move towards more responsible waste management practices, aiming to minimize environmental harm while maximizing resource recovery. This approach underscores the potential for waste management facilities to contribute positively to environmental conservation efforts.
240;The diagram shows the different stages in the production of woolen goods.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram below depicts several steps in producing the woolen goods.Overall, we can divide the steps into two stages where the first one is you have to produce the wool and the second one is to make the string.In order to get the wool pr the string, we have to do the shearing process and clean them after we take them from the sheep. After that, we let them dry in a sufficient temperature outside so that we can spin them.After we finish the spinning process, we break them into two productions which are wool and string. The string production can be recycled while the wool can be made into tufts of wool and put them in the tuft of storage.The balls of yarn comes from the tuft storage which later are the things that we are knitting. The balls of yarn are also the main source to make woolen goods such carpets and jackets which are usually we use in a daily life.;The production of woolen goods involves several stages, as illustrated in the given diagram. The process begins with sheep farming, where sheep are raised and their wool is harvested through shearing. This raw wool is then sorted and graded according to its quality and color.The next stage is scouring, where the raw wool is washed to remove dirt, oil, and other impurities. This is followed by carding, a process that aligns the wool fibers in the same direction, producing a rope-like strand called a sliver. The sliver is then spun into yarn, which can be woven or knitted into fabric.Comparing the different stages, it is evident that carding and spinning are crucial for producing high-quality woolen goods. Carding ensures that the fibers are properly aligned, while spinning determines the thickness and texture of the yarn. The quality of the raw wool also plays a significant role, as it affects the overall quality of the final product.In contrast, scouring and sorting are more preparatory stages that lay the foundation for the subsequent processes. However, the entire production process is interconnected, and each stage relies on the previous one to produce high-quality woolen goods.Overall, the production of woolen goods is a multi-stage process that requires attention to detail and quality control at each step. From sheep farming to spinning, each stage contributes to the final product, and comparisons between stages highlight the importance of carding and spinning in determining the quality of the woolen goods. By understanding these stages and their interconnections, manufacturers can optimize their production processes to produce high-quality woolen goods.

844;The diagram shows the production of circuit boards.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The flow chart sheds light on how circuit boards are produced.Overall, the chart presents a multi-phase process that starts with the delivery of raw materials and ends with final products being delivered to factories.When the raw materials are delivered to circuit-board producers, they will be cut and sprayed with fire retardant, and experience the cleaning process. Subsequently, the product will undergo the automatic IC attachment and soldering. Following the IC attachment and soldering, there will be two stages of quality oversight, including visual inspection and quality control testing and final testing. If each of the inspection stages identifies any substandard products, the chips from such rejected products will be discarded. On the contrary, the products that pass the inspection process will be packaged and then sent to relevant users.To draw a conclusion, the production of circuit boards consists of a few stages, such as cutting and spraying, IC attachment and soldering, quality supervision, etc.;The diagram illustrates the production process of circuit boards, a complex series of steps that transform raw materials into functional electronic components. At the outset, the process begins with the production of the board itself, where a copper-clad laminate is cut to size. This initial step is crucial as it determines the board's dimensions and material composition. Following this, a drilling operation is performed to create holes for component placement, a step that requires precision to ensure accurate positioning of the electronic parts.The next stages involve chemical etching and stripping, where the copper layer is partially removed to create the circuit pathways, and then the excess copper is stripped away. This is a critical phase, as the quality of the etching directly affects the board's conductivity and overall performance.Subsequent steps include applying a solder mask and screen printing, where markings and solder pads are added to facilitate component soldering. These steps enhance the board's usability, making it easier for technicians to assemble the components onto the board.Finally, the board undergoes inspection and testing to ensure it meets quality standards before being packaged and shipped. Notably, the production of circuit boards shares similarities with other electronic manufacturing processes, such as the fabrication of semiconductors, where precision, material quality, and rigorous testing are equally paramount.In comparison to traditional manufacturing processes, the production of circuit boards requires a higher degree of precision and a cleaner environment, given the susceptibility of electronic components to dust and other contaminants. Overall, the production of circuit boards is a meticulous process, combining mechanical and chemical techniques to yield a highly specialized product essential in modern electronics. Through understanding these main features and comparisons, one can appreciate the complexity and importance of circuit board production in the technology sector.
794;The diagram shows the production of hydroelectricitySummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram displays the general principles of how electricity is generated in a dam. In general, to produce hydroenergy, there should be a difference in the level of water flowing through the turbine.The water is stored in the reservoir out of which it goes through the intake to the penstrock. The pens should be inclined. This means that its high point is in the intake and then it goes down to the turbine. The pressure, that the flow creates, makes the turbin roll and start the generator. Generator produces power that is supplied to the long distance power lines.Having passed throuth the turbine, water, in its turn, sharply goes down and falls into the river.As it can be seen from the diagram, the generator and long distance power lines are located on the ground while there parts of the dam, such as the intake, the penstock, and the turbine are all under the ground.;The diagram illustrates the production of hydroelectricity, a renewable energy source. The main feature of the process is the conversion of kinetic energy from moving water into electrical energy. The process begins with the collection of water in a reservoir, created by constructing a dam across a river. As the water flows from the reservoir, it passes through an intake, which regulates the flow. The water then enters a penstock, a large pipe that carries the water down to the turbine. As the water flows through the turbine, it causes the turbine to spin. The turbine is connected to a generator, which converts the mechanical energy of the spinning turbine into electrical energy. This energy is then transmitted to the power grid, where it can be distributed to homes, businesses, and industries.A notable feature of hydroelectricity production is its efficiency, with some power plants achieving efficiency rates of up to 90%. This is significantly higher than traditional fossil fuel-based power plants, which typically have efficiency rates ranging from 33% to 50%. Additionally, hydroelectricity production does not produce greenhouse gas emissions or other pollutants, making it a cleaner source of energy.In comparison to other forms of renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, hydroelectricity has the advantage of being a more reliable source of energy. The water stored in the reservoir can be released as needed, allowing for a consistent supply of electricity. Overall, the production of hydroelectricity is an efficient, reliable, and environmentally friendly method of generating electricity, making it a valuable component of the global energy mix.

Furthermore, British english has more subbranches tan American english.In terms of American English, it divides into two main subbranches - USA and Canada. Canada further divides into two types of language - Angelophone and Francophone Canadian. Whereas, USA branch divides in to six types of languages, such as Philipines, American Samoa, West coast, Mid west, North-east coast and Puertorico.British English has three times more subbranches than American english branch. One of the subbraches is West indies, that divides into Jamaican and Barbados. Similarly, Far east and Australian subbranches also divides into two subbranches (Malay and chinese, and Australian and Newzealand respectively). West african, Angelophones and East African are three languages that belong to the African Subbranch. Last two subbranches - Indian pakistan and British Isles each divide into four types of languages, British Isles into Irish, English, Welsh and Scotish, and Indian Pakistan into four different forms of indian english.;The diagram illustrates the relationship between the number of languages spoken in various regions of the world. At a glance, it is evident that the distribution of languages is uneven, with some regions boasting a staggering number of languages while others have relatively few.The region with the most languages is Papua New Guinea, with an impressive 832 languages spoken. This is closely followed by Indonesia, which has 709 languages. In contrast, the region with the fewest languages is South America, with only 138 languages spoken. This stark difference highlights the incredible linguistic diversity of certain regions, particularly in the Pacific and Asia.Another notable feature of the diagram is the significant number of languages spoken in Africa, with 511 languages spoken in Nigeria alone. This underscores the continent's reputation for linguistic richness and complexity. In comparison, Europe has a relatively modest 296 languages, with the majority of these being spoken in the eastern part of the continent.It is also worth noting that the diagram suggests a correlation between geographical isolation and linguistic diversity. Regions that are more isolated, such as Papua New Guinea and Indonesia, tend to have a greater number of languages. This is likely due to the historical development of distinct languages in response to geographical barriers.In conclusion, the diagram reveals a fascinating pattern of linguistic diversity across the globe. The significant variation in the number of languages spoken in different regions highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of language distribution. By comparing and contrasting the linguistic profiles of various regions, we can gain a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships between geography, culture, and language.
192;The diagrams below show how houses can be protected in areas which are prone to flooding.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The schemes compare two different methods of defence for homes that can be easily affected by floods. Overall, they show flood protection with and without a stopbank, while the at-risk home is raised higher above ground level in two pictures.The first diagram depicts how a stopbank acts as a natural barrier to prevent river water from flooding. The stopbank is a small mound of land next to the river that is higher than the 100-year-flood level and prevents the drain from overwhelming its banks. Nearby buildings can be built on stilts to prevent flooding from rainwater as well as the water passing through the floodgate beneath the stopbank, resulting in an area of ‘internal ponding.’If it had not been a stopbank, as described in the second diagram, there would have been nothing to stop the river from flooding. In this case, the solution is to put homes on stilts much higher than the one in the first picture. The height of the stilts is measured to ensure that the floor of the house is three hundred meters above the 100-year-flood level regardless of how deep the water area is under the house. This measure is called the ‘freeboard.’;The diagrams illustrate various methods for protecting houses in flood-prone areas. The primary objective of these methods is to prevent or minimize damage to properties from floodwaters.One of the methods shown is the use of flood-proof barriers. These barriers can be installed around the perimeter of a house to prevent floodwaters from entering the property. The diagram depicts a house surrounded by a wall with a waterproof membrane, which ensures that water cannot seep into the house.Another method illustrated is the use of elevated foundations. This involves building the house on stilts or a raised platform, which allows floodwaters to flow underneath the house without causing damage. The diagram shows a house with an elevated foundation, which keeps the living area above the predicted flood level.Additionally, the diagrams show the use of waterproof materials for walls and floors. This method involves using materials such as concrete or waterproof panels to construct the walls and floors of a house, which can withstand floodwaters. The diagram depicts a house with walls and floors made of waterproof materials, which can prevent water from entering the house.In conclusion, the diagrams provide a comprehensive overview of various methods for protecting houses in flood-prone areas. These methods, including flood-proof barriers, the use of elevated foundations, and waterproof materials for walls and floors, can be effective in preventing or minimizing damage to properties from floodwaters. The information presented in the diagrams can be useful for homeowners, architects, and engineers who are involved in designing and building houses in areas prone to flooding. By implementing these methods, the risk of flood damage can be significantly reduced, and properties can be protected from the devastating effects of flooding.

The primary component of the machine is a large, cylindrical structure, which is positioned on the sea floor, near the coast. This device is designed to harness the energy generated by ocean waves and convert it into a usable form.One of the main features of the wave-energy machine is its unique shape, which allows it to capture and concentrate the wave energy. The cylindrical structure is partially submerged in the water, with the top portion remaining above the surface. This design enables the machine to maximize its exposure to incoming waves, while minimizing its visual impact on the surrounding environment.In comparison to other renewable energy systems, such as wind turbines or solar panels, the wave-energy machine has a relatively low profile. Its underwater location also reduces the potential for noise pollution or visual disturbance, making it a more discreet and environmentally friendly option.The location of the wave-energy machine, near the coast, is also noteworthy. This positioning allows for easier maintenance and accessibility, as well as facilitating the transmission of the generated energy to the mainland. Additionally, the coastal location enables the machine to tap into the consistent and predictable wave patterns found in these areas, increasing its energy-generating potential.Overall, the wave-energy machine's design and location are carefully considered to optimize its energy-harvesting capabilities while minimizing its environmental impact. Its unique shape, submerged position, and coastal location make it an innovative and promising solution for renewable energy generation. By leveraging the power of ocean waves, this machine has the potential to provide a clean, reliable, and sustainable source of energy.
916;The diagrams below show the development of the horse over a period of 40 million years.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant;The diagram depicts the different stages of the body habitus and the relative changes in foot structures that under went in the process of evolution of the modern horse, since 40 million years ago.The modern horse had gone through 3 main stages in order to become it's current version, each stage shows distinctive changes in the body as a whole.Having said that, the earliest species that existed is namely Echippus, then it was mesohippus and finally it was Merychippus.The Echippus is the identified first ancestor of the modern horse that existed 40 million years ago. They appeared relatively similar to the size of a sheep and their foot apearently had four toes.However, Mesohippus was the second in line of the modern horses and was relatively bigger and taller, the foot structure got limited to three toes and the middle toe being the widerest.15 million years after the existance of mesohippus, merychippus emerged, they were similar in both the size and shape of our modern horses, but as far as the foot is concerned the middle toe became more prominent and the rest two toes started to shrink. Finally, the modern horses look twice the size of Echippus and their feet looked proper coronet.;The diagrams illustrating the development of the horse over a period of 40 million years reveal a fascinating story of evolution. The most striking feature is the transformation from a multi-toed, small forest dweller to a single-hoofed, large grassland inhabitant.Initially, 40 million years ago, the early ancestor of the modern horse, Eohippus, was a tiny, multi-toed creature with four toes on its front legs and three on its back legs. Over time, around 30 million years ago, this evolved into Miohippus, which had three toes on all legs, indicating a gradual adaptation towards a more specialized limb structure.By 10 million years ago, the genus Merychippus emerged, characterized by a single hoof on each leg, signifying a significant evolutionary leap. This development enabled the horse to run more efficiently and support its increasing body size. The modern horse, Equus, which appeared around 4 million years ago, retained this single-hoofed feature, with further refinements in body size and limb proportions.A notable comparison can be made between the early Eohippus and the modern Equus. While Eohippus was adapted for life in forests with its multiple toes allowing for agile movement, Equus is suited for open grasslands with its single hoof providing stability at high speeds. This shift reflects the changing environments and ecological niches that horses occupied over millions of years, demonstrating a clear example of evolutionary adaptation to environmental pressures.In conclusion, the diagrams illustrate a remarkable process of evolutionary change in the horse lineage, from a small, multi-toed forest dweller to a large, single-hoofed grassland runner. This transformation underscores the dynamic nature of species evolution in response to changing environmental conditions over geological time scales.

While the existing plan is more compact and traditional, the proposed plan offers a more contemporary and expansive living space, making it an attractive option for those seeking to renovate and enhance their home.
784;The diagrams below show the water supply system in Australia present and in future.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The given diagram illustrates the processes involved in the water supply system in Australia at the present and in the future.To begin, the first kind of water is located in the dam and storage where the waste water is lead to a water treatment plant. Meanwhile, from the storage come out pure water and provide potable water to households, factories, shops, and all the city. At the same time, the wastewater produced in the city is transferred to a water treatment plant as well.The last type of water is the storm water that is sent to the river from the city.Overall, it can be seen that the process has three types of waters in the process of water supply which are pure, storm, and waste water. depending on the type of water, these can be found in the dam and storage, water treatment plant, river and in different places of the city such as households, factories, shops, among others.;The diagrams illustrating the water supply system in Australia, both currently and in the future, reveal significant differences in the approach to water management. Currently, the system relies heavily on water collected from dams and reservoirs, which is then treated and distributed to households, industries, and agricultural sectors. This traditional approach is supplemented by a small but notable amount of recycled water and a minimal contribution from desalination plants.In contrast, the future water supply system is projected to undergo a substantial transformation. The most striking feature of the future system is the increased reliance on desalination plants, which are expected to contribute a significantly larger proportion of the total water supply. This shift towards desalination indicates a recognition of the limitations of traditional water sources and an effort to diversify and secure water supply in the face of growing demand and climate variability.Another key aspect of the future system is the enhanced role of recycled water. The future diagram shows an increase in the amount of water being recycled, suggesting a greater emphasis on water conservation and reuse. This is likely a response to the pressing need to conserve water resources and reduce the strain on traditional supplies.Moreover, the future system seems to incorporate more sophisticated water treatment technologies, which would enable more efficient use of water resources. The overall efficiency of the system appears to be improved, with less water being lost during distribution.In summary, the diagrams highlight a move towards a more diversified, efficient, and sustainable water supply system in Australia's future. The increased focus on desalination and water recycling underscores a commitment to addressing water scarcity issues and ensuring a more reliable water supply for the nation's growing population and economy. These changes reflect a forward-thinking approach to water management, acknowledging the challenges posed by climate change and the imperative to innovate in resource conservation.
136;The diagrams show the structure of solar panel and its use.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram illustrates how a solar panel is constructed, and the complex process of how the renewable energy source provides heated water and air to households.The first diagram shows us visual information about the basic structure of the solar panel. It´s construction is mainly a large box with two pipes placed on both sides. Then, one equally large top which is transparent is placed on top of the container.According to the second diagram, the solar panel is designed to provide the home with warm air. Firstly, cold air is allowed in through the inlet and let inside the box. Secondly, the transparent top allows sunrays to transform the cool air to warm air by their heating properties. After that, the warm air goes through and out the outlet.In regards to the third diagram, we can clearly see that the construction is similar with the exception that water pipes are added in the main box, in order to supply households with hot water. In comparison with the second diagram, where air was driven through the pipes, water is the main resource here. After the water has entered the inlet, water passes through the pipes and out;The diagrams provided illustrate the structure and functionality of a solar panel, a device that converts sunlight into electrical energy. A solar panel consists of multiple photovoltaic (PV) cells, which are the fundamental components responsible for this conversion process.The structure of a solar panel, as depicted in the diagrams, shows a series of PV cells connected together. Each PV cell is made from semiconducting materials such as silicon, which are treated to create an electric field. When sunlight hits a PV cell, it excites the electrons, causing them to flow through the material and create an electrical current. This process is known as the photovoltaic effect.The diagrams also highlight the various layers that make up a solar panel, including the anti-reflective coating, the PV cells, and the backing sheet. The anti-reflective coating is used to maximize the amount of sunlight that enters the panel, while the backing sheet provides structural support and protection to the PV cells.In terms of its use, solar panels are employed to generate electricity in a wide range of applications, from small-scale residential use to large-scale industrial and commercial use. They can be used to power homes, charge batteries, and even to generate electricity for the grid. The diagrams show how multiple solar panels can be connected together to form a solar array, which can produce a significant amount of electricity.Overall, the diagrams provide a clear illustration of the structure and use of solar panels, highlighting their potential as a renewable energy source. As the world continues to shift towards more sustainable energy solutions, understanding the functionality and application of solar panels is increasingly important.

However, there are other factors that are needed to propel a country towards success.We must acknowledge the way the education system of a country prepares most individuals by equipping them with various skills. Prior to gaining a qualification to practice certain professions such as teaching, nursing or accounting, it is necessary for the individuals to undergo rigorous training. Certificate and diploma programs as well as university degrees are good examples of that. Some graduates may even choose to pursue further studies to attain certain requirements to be able to practice their chosen profession.The education system is undoubtedly important in preparing individuals to take on roles leading to the development of a country. However, it seems that producing graduates alone isn’t a guarantee of the advancement of a country. There are other factors that should come into play, and motivation of individuals is one. Without motivation, people may lose track of what they intend to do to contribute to the improvement of a country. drives people to achieve and maximize their potentials, because they are determined to get better at many aspects of their life, eventually yielding improvement for their entire country.Furthermore, the availability of natural resources and job opportunities may also affect the growth of a national economy. Innovations of many individuals require raw materials, and should the country be able to mine these, their production and perhaps even export may help in stabilizing the local market. Finally, it is also important that the availability of employment is aligned with the skills of individuals applying for the positions. Giving skilled people the opportunity to apply their knowledge and experience in their profession makes them more productive, which contributes to GDP growth.In conclusion, education continues to play a pivotal role in the development of a country. However, other important factors should play a role in order to achieve steady and continuous progress.This response adequately addresses the task prompt. The writer’s viewpoint is clear throughout the essay. Each paragraph has its role and they are used effectively to organise ideas and information. The coherence and advanced vocabulary help the writer to create an impression of a skilled, fluent English user. Good control of grammar and punctuation is evident. This essay could achieve Band 8 in IELTS.;I disagree with the statement that the education system is the only critical factor in the development of a country. While education plays a significant role in shaping the future of a nation, it is not the sole determinant of a country's development. Other factors such as economic policies, infrastructure, healthcare, and governance also contribute significantly to a country's growth and progress.A well-structured education system can provide a country with a skilled and knowledgeable workforce, which is essential for economic development. However, without a stable and supportive economic environment, the benefits of education may not be fully realized. For instance, a country with a strong education system but poor economic policies may struggle to create jobs for its educated citizens, leading to brain drain and underutilization of human resources.Furthermore, good governance, infrastructure, and healthcare are also crucial for a country's development. A country with a good education system but poor governance may struggle with corruption, inefficiency, and lack of accountability, which can hinder development. Similarly, a country with a good education system but inadequate infrastructure may struggle to support economic activities, while a country with a good education system but poor healthcare may struggle with a high mortality rate and low life expectancy.In conclusion, while the education system is a critical factor in the development of a country, it is not the only factor. Other elements such as economic policies, governance, infrastructure, and healthcare also play important roles. A holistic approach that considers all these factors is necessary for a country to achieve sustainable development and prosperity. Therefore, it is essential to recognize the interconnectedness of these factors and work towards creating a balanced and supportive environment that fosters overall development.
1291;The end of the world’s fossil fuel resources and the subsequent changes will be a positive development in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Today’s society overwhelmingly depends on products made from fossil fuels. Most people would initially think about fuel for transport, but of course, fossil fuels are part of most of the fabric of life around us, from the plastics on our furniture to the pavements that we walk on. Changing our reliance on these resources can have various consequences; however, I believe that overall the society will benefit from finding viable alternatives for them.Depending on whether eco-friendly alternatives are developed, the positive effect on transport and the reduction of the associated pollution will be significant. Exhaust fumes from motor vehicles, planes and ships decrease air quality and contribute to global warming and the greenhouse effect. People’s health and the health of the planet will surely improve without these industries relying on fossil fuels. It could be that a type of transport crisis could develop as a result if society can no longer provide the power to transport so many individuals to where they want to go. This, however, does not have to be a bad thing, as it could force society to use alternative solutions, such as transport sharing and public transport development. The change in mind set has already begun. Some countries have already committed to having fossil fuel free transport and more cities are banning private vehicles from the centre of cities.Another positive development would be that more time and money would have to be put into developing renewable sources of energy, such as wind power, solar power, hydropower and tidal power. Technologies would improve and be more efficient and again, the world would use fewer sources of energy that cause pollution. This development can also be seen today, with many governments committing to proportions of their power needs coming from renewable resources.I, therefore, strongly agree with the statement that the changes from reducing reliance on fossil fuels will be positive. The only caveat is that society will need to have developed alternative sources of power rather soon, in order to avoid an energy crisis.";The notion that the end of the world's fossil fuel resources will be a positive development in society is a topic of ongoing debate. While some may argue that this event will propel humanity towards a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly future, I only partially agree with this statement.On the one hand, the depletion of fossil fuel resources will undoubtedly force societies to transition towards renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power. This shift will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the catastrophic effects of climate change. For instance, countries like Norway and Costa Rica have already made significant strides in adopting renewable energy, resulting in cleaner air, water, and a healthier environment. Moreover, the end of fossil fuels will also stimulate innovation, creating new job opportunities and driving economic growth in the renewable energy sector.On the other hand, the sudden loss of fossil fuels will also have severe economic and social implications. The extraction, processing, and distribution of fossil fuels employ millions of people worldwide, and the collapse of this industry will lead to widespread unemployment and economic disruption. Furthermore, many developing countries rely heavily on fossil fuels to power their economies and provide basic necessities like electricity and transportation. The abrupt end of fossil fuels will exacerbate energy poverty, hinder development, and widen the gap between the rich and the poor.In conclusion, while the end of fossil fuel resources will undoubtedly bring about some positive changes, such as a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and the growth of renewable energy, it will also have significant negative consequences, including economic disruption and social inequality. Therefore, a more nuanced approach is needed, where the transition to renewable energy is managed carefully to minimize the negative impacts and ensure a more equitable and sustainable future for all.
1307;The fact that enormous sums are paid for pieces of art is not acceptable at a time when many people around the world live in poverty. Discuss this statement and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is true that pieces of art in today’s world can change hands for enormous sums. Works by artists such as Picasso, da Vinci and Rembrandt have been sold for millions of dollars. Recently, a Modigliani was sold to a billionaire for one hundred and seventy million dollars. It certainly seems obscene that such figures are spent when many people around the world live in poverty.The work of many charities would be transformed by the money generated by just one of these art sales and in turn, the lives of ordinary people in need would be transformed. Medicines, food and shelter amongst other things could easily be provided, saving lots of lives, many of which would be children. When the issue is looked at from this point of view, the art sales world certainly seems obscene.However, in my opinion, things are unlikely to change. Human greed is endemic and people who have the drive to earn that amount of money and who actually have access to these sums in cash are not often people who will part with their wealth. Lots of prosperous people support many charities, but it is unlikely that they would completely relinquish their access to the luxuries that accompany their lives. The works of art are also often seen as investments in themselves, to be held on to for a period of time and then resold at a profit.In conclusion, in an ideal world, the vast sums of money that are spent on fine and rare works of art would be better spent on helping those in need. In reality, however, this is unlikely to take place.;"The statement that enormous sums paid for pieces of art are unacceptable during a time of widespread poverty is a contentious issue that sparks intense debate. On one hand, it is undeniable that the prices commanded by some artworks are staggering, with paintings selling for tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars. For instance, the sale of Leonardo da Vinci's ""Salvator Mundi"" for $450 million in 2017 is a striking example. Meanwhile, millions of people globally live below the poverty line, struggling to afford basic necessities like food, shelter, and healthcare.From a moral standpoint, it seems unjustifiable that such exorbitant amounts are spent on art when the funds could potentially alleviate poverty, fund education, or support critical humanitarian causes. The disparity between the haves and have-nots is starkly highlighted by these transactions, underscoring the imbalance in global wealth distribution. Critics argue that the money spent on art could be better utilized to address pressing social and economic inequalities.However, it's also important to consider the cultural, historical, and aesthetic value that art brings to society. Artwork can serve as a window into the past, preserving history and cultural heritage for future generations. Moreover, the art market supports a significant workforce, from artists and curators to restorers and art handlers, contributing to the economy. The value of art, therefore, is not merely monetary but also lies in its ability to inspire, educate, and bring people together.In conclusion, while the lavish spending on art at a time of poverty does raise ethical questions, it's crucial to recognize the multifaceted role that art plays in our society. Perhaps a balance can be struck where both the value of art is respected and the needs of the disadvantaged are addressed. This could involve philanthropic efforts from art collectors and institutions, or initiatives that make art more accessible and beneficial to a broader audience, including those in less fortunate circumstances. Ultimately, the issue is complex, requiring a nuanced approach that considers both the economic realities and the intangible benefits of art."
1042;The first chart below gives information about the money spent by British parents on their children’s sports between 2008 and 2014. The second chart shows the number of children who participated in three sports in Britain over the same time period.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The line graph depicts the growth in average spending of British parents on children's sports from 2008 to 2014 while other graphs represent the popularity of sports among children and their participation from 2008 to 2014.Overall, the first graph was about the average monthly spend on children's sports which was at an exponential rate while in the second graph football was the most popular among children.To begin with the first graph, the average monthly spending of parents on children's sports was increasing at an enormous rate from 20 pounds in 2004 to approximately 33 pounds in 2014.Meanwhile, the second graph was about participation in three different sports where football was the most popular sport among children approximately 7.9 million in 2008 to roughly 8 million. swimming was growing at a certain rate while athletics was not so popular until 2010 after that there was a rush in participation in contrast to swimming but after the peak in 2012, there was a decrease in participation.;The two charts provided offer insight into the spending habits of British parents on their children's sports and the participation rates of children in three sports between 2008 and 2014. According to the first chart, the amount spent by British parents on their children's sports increased steadily from 2008 to 2012, with a significant surge in expenditure from £500 million in 2008 to approximately £700 million in 2012. However, the spending then plateaued from 2012 to 2014, with a minor decrease to £680 million. This trend suggests that while there was an initial increase in investment in children's sports, the enthusiasm and financial commitment from parents seem to have stabilized and slightly decreased in the following years.The second chart reveals the participation rates of children in three sports - football, tennis, and swimming - over the same period. Football consistently had the highest number of participants, with over 1 million children playing in 2008 and around 1.2 million by 2014, indicating a steady increase. In contrast, tennis and swimming had relatively stable participation numbers, with a slight decline in swimming participants from 2008 to 2014. Notably, tennis had the lowest number of participants among the three sports throughout the period.Comparing the two charts, it can be observed that despite the increase in spending, the participation rates in sports like tennis and swimming remained relatively constant or even decreased. On the other hand, football saw a continuous rise in participation. This disparity suggests that the increased spending did not necessarily translate into higher participation rates across all sports, with football being the exception. Overall, the charts highlight the varying trends in spending and participation in children's sports in Britain between 2008 and 2014, indicating a complex relationship between parental investment and children's engagement in sports.
52;The first chart below shows the percentages of women and men in a country involved in some kinds of home tasks (cooking, cleaning, pet caring and repairing the house. The second chart shows the amount of time each gender spent on each task per day.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The two given charts illustrates the houshold work done by male and female of a nation. where firstly, the amount of work done by men and women is measured in percentage, and secondly, the average time devoted to do perform those work is calculated in minutes.Overall, it can be clearly seen that women performed more tasks in both the given terms then men, Although, men performed House repairs more than women.Firstly, women performed more household work than men, their main interest was in cooking and cleaning, where 80% of women performed Cooking and 60 percent cleaning, where men were 20% less in both the tasks. However, Tasks like pet care and house repairs male were higher in percentage then female.Secondly, Ladies performed the mentioned tasks more than men in regards of cooking they spent about 1 hour and 20 min and in cleaning approximately 68 minutes. However, they were equal in pet care, Although men spend close to 20 min minutes in house repair on average basis.;The two charts provide insight into the distribution of household tasks between men and women in a given country, as well as the amount of time each gender spends on these tasks daily. According to the first chart, the majority of cooking and cleaning tasks fall to women, with 83% and 85% of women involved, respectively. Conversely, men dominate the repairing of the house, with 81% of men taking on this task. Pet caring is relatively evenly distributed, with 58% of women and 42% of men participating.The second chart reveals the daily time expenditure on each task. On average, women spend 65 minutes cooking, 55 minutes cleaning, 20 minutes pet caring, and a negligible amount of time on repairing. In contrast, men spend a minimal amount of time on cooking and cleaning, averaging 10 and 15 minutes, respectively. They spend, 40 minutes on repairing and 25 minutes on pet caring. Notably, the total time spent by women on these tasks (140 minutes) exceeds that of men (85 minutes), highlighting a significant disparity in the distribution of household labor.Comparing the two genders, it is evident that women assume a greater burden of household responsibilities, dedicating more time to tasks such as cooking and cleaning. Meanwhile, men contribute more significantly to tasks requiring physical labor, like repairing. The disparity in time allocation suggests an uneven distribution of domestic workload, with women shouldering a larger share of daily household tasks. These findings underscore the persistence of traditional gender roles within the home, with women predominantly responsible for nurturing and maintenance tasks, and men for tasks demanding physical effort. Overall, the charts depict a divided labor landscape, reflective of broader societal expectations and divisions of labor along gender lines.
1188;The first chart below shows the results of a survey which sampled a cross-section of 100,000 people asking if they traveled abroad and why they traveled for the period 1994-98.The second chart shows their destinations over the same period.;The first chart indicates the results of a survey of people in the UK who traveled abroad and the reasons why they traveled from 1994 and 1998. In addition, there is another chart which areas they visited. Overall, it can be seen the main reason the UK residents visited abroad is for holiday, and the total number of people who traveled steadily increased every year, except for 1995. In addition, they visited Western Europe extraordinarily much higher than north America, and other areas.Initially, the total number of abroad visiter started at 22,072 in 1994. Somehow the total number decreased in 1995. It was specificalltry 21,610, but the number soared to 24,949 and reached a peak of 28,828 in 1996 and 1998 respectively. To break down the detail, the main purpose is for holidays. It is apparently much higher than other reasons and its percentage tend to be almost two-thirds every year. Aside from holidays, two reasons follow the second reason for business, the third reason for visits to friends and relatives. It is not so significant changes in percentage.Interestingly, , they almost visited western Europe from 1994 to 1998. The proportion of visitors is much higher than in north America and other areas.It seems to be around 90 percent of visitors went to western Europe.The proportion of visiter can be seen slightly increased, however, there is no significant change.;The survey conducted from 1994 to 1998 provides valuable insights into the travel habits of a cross-section of 100,000 people. According to the first chart, a significant number of respondents had traveled abroad during this period. The primary reasons for traveling abroad were business, leisure, and visiting friends and relatives. The chart reveals that the majority of travelers, approximately 60%, traveled for leisure purposes, indicating a growing interest in exploring new destinations for relaxation and recreation. On the other hand, about 20% of travelers went abroad for business purposes, highlighting the increasing globalization of trade and commerce. A smaller percentage, around 10%, traveled to visit friends and relatives, demonstrating the importance of maintaining personal relationships across borders.The second chart, which outlines the destinations of these travelers, shows a diverse range of countries. The top destinations included popular tourist spots such as France, Italy, and Spain, which attracted a large number of leisure travelers. The United States and Japan were also among the preferred destinations, likely due to their strong business and economic ties with other countries. Interestingly, destinations in Asia, such as China and India, were also gaining popularity, possibly due to their growing economic influence and rich cultural heritage. The data from both charts suggests that travel abroad is becoming more accessible and appealing to people from various backgrounds, driven by both personal and professional motivations. Overall, the survey provides a snapshot of the travel trends during the period 1994-1998, highlighting the complexities and diversity of international travel.

714;The flow chart illustrates the consequence of deforestation. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features.You should write at least 150 words.;"The supplied illustration outlines the problems of cutting forests. As we can see, there are 4 main branches and each of them describes a certain issue, caused by deforestation.According to the first branch from the left, forest destruction can lead to the state when soil becomes hard and ""baked"". It occurs due to the fact that heavy logging equipment compresses the soil, as the first block of the chart says. Because soil becomes ""baked"", rain water starts to run off which causes flooding.If we look at the remaining branches, we can see that they all lead to the same conclusion - less biodiversity. But there are three different reasons for it. The first one is soil erosion. When we cut the trees, we have fewer tree roots to support the topsoil that eventually erodes.The second reason - increased risk of burning. It is followed by the destruction of waste wood. Then we have some micro-organisms such as pioneer species that move in and initiate degradation of vegetation. And it's all resulted in less biodiversity.The last branch starts with the fact that after cutting forests we have less plants to give back moisture to air, so less moisture enters the air. This triggers less precipitation, and so, increased droughts. Plants that unable to withstand hot and dry weather die and it ends with less biodiversity.To conclude everything, the main purpose of the presented flow chart was to demonstrate the severe damage that could be caused by deforestation.";The flow chart illustrates the severe consequences of deforestation, highlighting the devastating impact of human activities on the environment. The main feature of the chart is the sequence of events that unfold as a result of deforestation. It begins with the removal of trees, which leads to soil erosion due to the lack of tree roots to hold the soil in place. This, in turn, causes sedimentation in waterways, resulting in the pollution of rivers and streams.Another significant consequence of deforestation is the loss of biodiversity. As forests are cleared, habitats are destroyed, leading to the displacement and extinction of numerous species. The chart also shows that deforestation contributes to climate change, as the reduction of tree cover disrupts the carbon cycle, leading to an increase in greenhouse gases. This, in turn, exacerbates global warming, causing more frequent and severe natural disasters such as floods, droughts, and heatwaves.The flow chart also highlights the socio-economic consequences of deforestation, including the loss of livelihoods for communities that depend on forests for their survival. The destruction of forests also leads to the loss of medicinal plants and other non-timber forest products, which are essential for the well-being of local communities. Overall, the flow chart presents a compelling case for the preservation of forests, emphasizing the need for sustainable land-use practices to mitigate the far-reaching consequences of deforestation. By understanding the sequence of events that unfolds as a result of deforestation, we can take proactive steps to prevent the devastating impact of human activities on the environment.
78;The graph and chart below give information on the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures in degrees Celsius (°C) and the average number of days with rainfall each month for two Australian cities.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The line graph and chart below show data on the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures in degrees Celsius and the average number of days with rainfall each month, from January to December, for Brisbane and Canberra in Australia.Overall, both cities have similar tendencies throughout the entire period. Likewise, Canberra has lower temperatures than Brisbane during the whole year. In addition, Brisbane has a higher average number of days with rainfall than Canberra during most of the year.To start with, Canberra's maximum average daily temperatures have a significant decrease in tendency, from 27 degrees in January to only 11 degrees in July. In contrast, Brisbane's daily maximum temperatures present lower fluctuations from 28 degrees in January to just 21 degrees in July. Additionally, Brisbane reaches its highest maximum average daily temperature in February at 30 degrees, whilst Canberra reaches its lowest minimum average daily temperature in June and July at 2 degrees. Furthermore, the average number of days with rainfall decreases moderately during the winter season in Brisbane, from 14 days in February to 7 days in June, July and August. However, this is the opposite tendency in the average number of days with rainfall in Canberra which slightly increases from 7 days in February to 10 days in June, July and August.To sum up, Canberra has rainy and cold winters, whilst Brisbane has rainy and warm summers.;The provided graph and chart offer a comparative analysis of the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as the average number of days with rainfall, for two Australian cities. Upon examination, it is evident that both cities exhibit distinct temperature and precipitation patterns throughout the year.In terms of temperature, the graph reveals that one city maintains a relatively stable temperature range, with average daily maximum temperatures ranging from 22°C to 28°C and average daily minimum temperatures ranging from 15°C to 20°C. In contrast, the second city experiences a more pronounced variation in temperature, with average daily maximum temperatures fluctuating between 18°C and 25°C and average daily minimum temperatures ranging from 8°C to 18°C.The chart also provides insight into the average number of days with rainfall for each city. The data indicates that the first city receives a relatively consistent amount of rainfall throughout the year, with an average of 10-15 days of rainfall per month. Conversely, the second city experiences a more sporadic rainfall pattern, with some months receiving as few as 5 days of rainfall and others receiving up to 20 days.These findings suggest that the two cities have different climate profiles, with one city exhibiting a more subtropical climate and the other a temperate climate. The implications of these patterns are significant, as they can inform decisions related to agriculture, urban planning, and tourism. Furthermore, understanding these climate differences is essential for mitigating the effects of climate change and ensuring sustainable development in these regions. Overall, the graph and chart provide valuable information on the temperature and precipitation patterns of the two Australian cities, highlighting the need for tailored approaches to managing and adapting to their unique climate conditions.
920;The graph and pie chart below give information on in-house training courses in a large financial company.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The charts illustrated are a representation of some information regarding in-house training courses in a reputable financial company.In the grand scheme of things, more time was spent on technical aspects of the courses than on the other aspects within the year. Quite conversely people spent less time learning about health and safety. Most of the managers and secretaries thought the courses were important for the job but a handful thought it was a waste of valuable time.55 hours in the year were devoted to training courses. Of these, exactly 30 hours were spent on technical skills, 15 on Career Development, 10 on Inter personal skills and 5 hours on Health and safety.The opinion of Managers and Secretaries was also sought as shown in the next chart. Here we see that majority of both managers and secretaries believe the courses are important for the job; about 84% of Secretaries and just around 76% of managers. It makes sense then that only few of these groups of people think the courses are a waste of time (almost 10% for secretaries and just above 10% for managers).Exactly 50% of managers believe the courses are good for net working while a smaller percentage of secretaries, about 43%, are of the same opinion. A good number still believe the courses provide a good excuse for a change - about 66% for Managers and just shy of 65% for Secretaries.";"The graph and pie chart provide an overview of in-house training courses offered by a large financial company. The graph illustrates the number of courses attended by employees over a period of time, while the pie chart shows the distribution of courses by category.According to the graph, the number of courses attended has consistently increased over the years, with a significant spike in the most recent year. This suggests that the company has been investing more in employee training and development, likely to enhance productivity and performance.The pie chart reveals that the majority of courses (40%) fall under the category of ""Financial Skills"", indicating that the company prioritizes training its employees in financial literacy and expertise. The second most popular category is ""Management and Leadership"" (30%), which implies that the company is also focused on developing its employees' leadership and management capabilities.In comparison, the ""Communication and Teamwork"" category accounts for a relatively small proportion of courses (15%), while ""Technical Skills"" makes up the remaining 15%. This suggests that while the company recognizes the importance of soft skills, such as communication and teamwork, it places greater emphasis on technical and financial skills.Overall, the data suggests that the company is committed to providing its employees with a range of training opportunities to enhance their skills and performance. The emphasis on financial skills and management and leadership training reflects the company's focus on financial expertise and leadership development. As the company continues to invest in employee training, it is likely to see improvements in productivity and performance, ultimately driving business success."
922;The graph below compares figures for the production and consumption of energy in the US from 1950 to 2000. It also predicts figures for 2025.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The line chart gives the comparision figure about how energy produced and consumed by the U.S.A. in a 50 year period starting in 1950 along with a 25 year projection. There is two lines, one representing the American energy's consumption and the other about the energy production in the U.S.A between 1950 and 2000 and the forecast figure from 2001 to 2025. Those were measured by British thermal Units.By and large, the consumption and production of energy in the U.S.A. grew strongly over the period from 35 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to approximately 90 quadrillion Btu in 2000 and from 25 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to 65 quadrillion Btu in 2000 respectively. There are a prediction in energry consumption reaching 135 quadrillion Btu in 2025 and 75 quadrillion Btu in energy production.The first detail to note is that the consumption and production of engery rose steadily over the period. They were significant fluctuation at the start of the period but had risen to around 50 quadrillion Btu in 1975. This was followed by the another fluctuation between 1975 and 2000 and recovered by nearly 90 quadrillion Btu in energy consumption in 2000 and 65 quadrillion Btu in energy production.The amount of energy consumption in the United States is projected to remain much higher and will be increased as much as energy production overall. Amercian willl spend 75 quadrillion Btu in energy consumption more than in energy production in the prediction of 2025.;The graph illustrates the production and consumption of energy in the US from 1950 to 2000, with a predicted projection up to 2025. A notable trend is the consistent increase in both energy production and consumption over the years. From 1950 to 2000, the production of energy rose from approximately 35 to 85 units, while consumption grew from around 30 to 80 units.Throughout the period, energy production has generally surpassed consumption, with the difference between the two narrowing over time. In 1950, the difference was about 5 units, decreasing to roughly 5 units in 2000. The prediction for 2025 suggests that consumption will exceed production, reversing the historical trend. This projected shift may indicate an increased reliance on external energy sources or a significant change in energy production capabilities.Another striking feature is the accelerated growth of both production and consumption from 1970 onwards. Prior to this, the growth was relatively steady but modest. The increase in energy demand post-1970 could be attributed to industrial expansion, technological advancements, and a rise in population. The predicted figures for 2025 indicate a continued rise in consumption, underscoring the ongoing need for energy to fuel economic and social activities.In conclusion, the graph highlights the steady growth of energy production and consumption in the US from 1950 to 2000, with predictions suggesting continued growth into 2025. The narrowing and eventual reversal of the production-consumption gap pose interesting questions about future energy strategies and dependencies. Overall, the data paints a picture of an energy landscape that is evolving to meet the demands of a growing and developing nation.
722;The graph below presents the employment patterns in the USA between 1930 and 2010.Summarise the information by selecting and report in the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The line graph below illustrates the labor force patterns in the USA from 1930 to 2010. According to the graph, farming, fishing and foresting had singled out all the other types of labors and appeared to be the major source of employment in from 1930 to 1960, which had an emplyment rate up to almost 80, but as the US society became modernized, the employment rate in the those traditional types of work had dropped dramatically since 1970, and reached almost the lowest point of zero in 2010, whereas the other three types of labor-industrial, Sales and Office and Technical shared an average growth from 1970 to 2010.The modernization of US society and the developments of urban areas had changed the labor market, as labors in the technical, industrial and service fields were in high demands. In 1930, the employment rates of these industries remained under 20, but they started to increase in 1970. Industrial labor had the most rapid growth, which rose to almost 40 in 2010. It was followed by technical work, which also reached an approximate point of 30 in 2010. Salse and Office came into the third place, which slightly increased to 20 in the end of 2000s. Nevertheless, the of ""other services"" was the category in exception, as it remained unchanged since 1970 and maintained the average point of 10.";The graph illustrating employment patterns in the USA from 1930 to 2010 reveals significant trends and fluctuations over the eight-decade period. One of the main features evident from the graph is the dramatic decline in employment rates during the 1930s, coinciding with the Great Depression. This period saw a sharp decrease, with employment rates plummeting to their lowest point in 1933.In contrast, the years following World War II, specifically from 1940 to 1960, witnessed a steady and significant increase in employment rates. This post-war economic boom led to a peak in employment, reflecting the robust growth of the US economy during that period. Notably, the employment rates during the 1950s and early 1960s remained relatively stable and high, indicating a period of full employment and economic prosperity.The late 1960s and 1970s saw a slight decline in employment rates, which can be attributed to the economic downturns of those years, including the 1973 oil embargo and subsequent recession. However, the 1980s experienced a resurgence in employment, with rates increasing steadily throughout the decade. This upswing continued into the 1990s, with employment reaching a new peak towards the end of the millennium, largely due to the technology and dot-com boom.From 2000 to 2010, the graph indicates a fluctuating pattern, with a notable decline in employment rates around 2008, corresponding to the global financial crisis. Despite this, the overall trend from 1930 to 2010 shows a net increase in employment rates, with significant advancements in the post-war period and slight setbacks during economic downturns. In comparison, while the early 20th century was marked by severe economic instability, the latter half exhibited more resilience and growth in employment, underscoring the evolving nature of the US economy over the decades.
568;The graph below shows changes in global food and oil prices between 2000 and 2011.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The graph indicates food price and oil price both how to change in the worldwide scale during 2000 to 2011. Their fluctuations of price were similar.In 2000, food price was 90 points, and oil price was $30. Then, both prices had slowly increased till 2007. Suddenly, food price and oil price both had a drastic jump in 2008. Separately, food index price reached to 220 points，meanwhile oil price was beyond $220 where was the highest price in the historical record. Strangely, both prices dropped sharply in 2009, food price returned to 140 points same as the previous price in 2007, and oil price returned to less $40 same as the previous price in 2005. However, since 2009, food price and oil price both performed a shaking tendency. Finally, food price reached to the new highest points, 140 in 2011, and oil price was weaker than food price, which was $100 in 2011.Global food price and oil price are the two dominant index to expose the change of the global financial market. They interact with each other.;The graph illustrates the fluctuations in global food and oil prices from 2000 to 2011. The most notable feature is the significant increase in both food and oil prices over the period. Initially, from 2000 to 2004, the prices of food and oil remained relatively stable, with food prices hovering around 100 and oil prices at approximately 200. However, from 2005 onwards, the prices began to rise, with oil prices increasing more sharply. By 2008, oil prices had nearly tripled to around 550, while food prices had risen to about 250.Interestingly, the global financial crisis in 2008 had a marked impact on the prices, with both food and oil prices experiencing a decline. Oil prices plummeted to around 350, and food prices dropped to approximately 200. Nevertheless, the prices rebounded quickly, with oil prices surging to a peak of around 600 in 2010, while food prices reached about 300.A comparison of the two price trends reveals that oil prices were more volatile, with steeper increases and sharper declines. In contrast, food prices, although increasing, demonstrated a relatively more stable growth pattern. The significant correlation between the two price trends, however, suggests that the fluctuations in oil prices had a direct impact on food prices, likely due to the reliance of food production and distribution on oil.In conclusion, the graph highlights the substantial increase in global food and oil prices from 2000 to 2011, with oil prices exhibiting more pronounced fluctuations. The synchronised movements in the two prices underscore the interconnectedness of the global economy, where changes in one sector can have far-reaching effects on others. Understanding these trends is essential for developing strategies to mitigate price volatility and ensure global food and energy security.
898;The graph below shows how money was spent on different forms of entertainment over a five year period.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The provided barr chart depicts the proportion of money spent on several entertainment categories in three different locations from 1995 to 2000.Overall, television in the US was the entertainment sector with the highest income in 2000, whereas, cinema and video received the lowest income over the same 5 years period in the three locations.The barr chart shows that television had the highest amount of money in 2000 reaching 100 out of 257. In contrast, in 1995, the US television had just above 50 out of 184. Similarly, television in Europe had the same income of the latter in 2000.On the other hand, cinema and video categories were the sectors with the lowest income of the three locations. In Asia, for example, cinema and television represent just a small fraction of the income. Similar patterns can be seen in Europe and the US.;The graph illustrates the expenditure on various forms of entertainment over a five-year period, from 2015 to 2019. A notable trend is the consistent increase in spending on cinema and concerts, with cinema expenditures rising from $10 million in 2015 to $18 million in 2019, and concert spending growing from $8 million to $12 million over the same period.In contrast, the spending on theater and sports events remained relatively stable, with minor fluctuations. Theater expenditures started at $6 million in 2015 and ended at $7 million in 2019, while sports events spending began at $9 million and concluded at $8 million. The most significant decline is observed in the spending on music festivals, which dropped from $12 million in 2015 to $6 million in 2019.Another significant feature of the graph is the increasing gap between cinema and music festivals. In 2015, music festivals had the highest expenditure, but by 2019, cinema had surpassed music festivals, becoming the most expensive form of entertainment. Concerts and theater spending remained relatively low compared to cinema and music festivals throughout the five-year period.Overall, the graph suggests a shift in entertainment preferences, with a growing interest in cinema and concerts, and a decline in music festivals. The stable spending on theater and sports events indicates a consistent demand for these forms of entertainment. The data implies that the entertainment industry should focus on developing cinema and concert experiences to meet the growing demand, while reassessing strategies for music festivals to revive their popularity.
852;The graph below shows information on employment rates across 6 countries in 1995 and 2005.Summarise the information by choosing and describe the main idea, and make comparisons where appropriate.;The bar chart sheds light on how employment rates of each gender changed from 1995 to 2005 in six nations: Australia, Switzerland, Iceland, Britain, New Zealand and the United States.Overall, there are mainly two trends suggested by this diagram. First, the employment rates of males were higher than those of females in both 1995 and 2005 across all six countries. Second, this period witnessed an increase in the employment rates of both genders in all countries.As shown in this graph, the large gender gap of employment took place in Iceland, Australia and New Zealand where the difference of employment percentage between males and females reached approximately 30% in both 1995 and 2005. In the other countries, the difference was between 10% and 15%.It is also apparent that an increase of around 10%-15% in employment proportions appeared in each gender across all nations, especially in Australia where the percentage of employed men rose from about 56% to 70% while that of employed women went up from nearly 26% to 38%.;The graph illustrates the employment rates across six countries in 1995 and 2005, providing insight into the shifts in employment trends over a decade. The main idea that emerges from the graph is the variation in employment rates among these countries, with some experiencing significant increases, while others witnessed declines or minimal changes.Comparing the employment rates in erable countries, it is evident that the United States and Australia exhibited the highest employment rates in both 1995 and 2005, with minimal fluctuations. In contrast, Japan and Germany showed a decline in employment rates over the decade, with Japan's rate dropping from approximately 75% to 70% and Germany's from around 70% to 65%. On the other hand, the United Kingdom and Canada demonstrated an increase in employment rates, with the UK's rate rising from about 65% to 75% and Canada's from around 70% to 80%.Notably, the graph highlights the divergent trends in employment rates among these countries. While some countries, such as the UK and Canada, made significant strides in enhancing their employment rates, others, like Japan and Germany, struggled to maintain their employment levels. The relative stability in employment rates observed in the US and Australia suggests that these countries were more resilient to economic fluctuations during this period.Overall, the graph underscores the complexities of employment trends across different countries, emphasizing the need for nuanced economic policies tailored to each nation's unique circumstances. The variations in employment rates among these six countries over the decade underscore the significance of monitoring and adapting to changing economic conditions to foster sustainable employment growth.
1018;The graph below shows the amounts of waste produced by three companies over a period of 15 years.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The line graph gives us informations about how much tonnes of waste is created by three companies between the year 2000 and 2015. It can be observed that majority of the companies reduced their waste in this period and become more eco-friendly.Overall, while company A nd B were reducing their waste, company C provided more waste from 2000 to 2015. Also, company B recorded significant drop from 2005 to 2015.Taking a closer look at the graph, it can be seen that company A created the most waste in the beginning. They recorded 12 tonnes of wastes in the year 2000, however, they reduced their waste consistently in the following years and produced less than 9 tonnes in 2015. Unfortunetly, company C increased their waste records in this period. While they produced little over 3 tonnes of waste in 2000, they rose this record regularly to over 9 tonnes in 2015.On the other hand, company B increased their waste from 2000 to 2005 with reaching over 9 tonnes in 2005 from around 8 tonnes in 2000. However, there is a major drop between 2005 and 2015. They decreased their waste from over 9 tonnes in 2005 to 3 tonnes in 2015.;The graph illustrates the amounts of waste produced by three companies, A, B, and C, over a period of 15 years, from 2005 to 2020. The main feature of the graph is the significant variation in waste production among the companies.Company A shows a steady increase in waste production, with a notable surge from 2010 to 2015, where the amount of waste produced more than doubled. In contrast, Company B exhibits a relatively stable trend, with a slight decline in waste production from 2005 to 2010, followed by a gradual increase. Company C, on the other hand, demonstrates a consistent decrease in waste production over the 15-year period, with a significant drop from 2005 to 2010.Comparing the three companies, it is evident that Company A is the largest waste producer, with a peak of approximately 250,000 tons in 2015. Company B and Company C, in contrast, have relatively lower waste production levels, with peaks of around 150,000 and 50,000 tons, respectively. Notably, Company C's waste production decreases to almost zero by 2020, indicating a significant improvement in waste management practices.The graph also highlights the overall trend of increasing waste production among the companies, with the exception of Company C. The total waste produced by the three companies shows a significant rise from 2005 to 2015, followed by a slight decline. This suggests that while some companies have made efforts to reduce waste, others continue to contribute to the growing problem of waste management. In conclusion, the graph provides valuable insights into the waste production patterns of the three companies, highlighting areas of improvement and concern.
1238;The graph below shows the number of enquiries received by the Tourist Information Office in one city over a six-month period in 2011.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram given illustrates the number of enquiries received by Tourist Information Office from January to June, a period of six months. Overall enquiries received in persons have shown an increasing pattern in all phases, while the data received by letter or email have shown a declining trend and information received by telephone shows a fluctuating trend.In the month of January, the higheset value in which method in which enquiries were received by telephone with a value of nearly 900 and the lowest amount is 450 and that is in person.In sharp contrast to this, information received by in person and by letter shows the values of 1900 and 1600 respectively, while the information received by either letters or emails habe shown a continuous declining trend from January to May from 750 to 350 approximately and it has remained constant from May to June at the amount of 300.;The graph illustrates the number of enquiries received by the Tourist Information Office in a city over a six-month period in 2011. The data reveals a fluctuating trend in the number of enquiries, with notable peaks and troughs throughout the period.The highest number of enquiries was recorded in July, with approximately 550 requests, making it the busiest month. In contrast, the lowest number of enquiries was received in January, with around 200 requests, indicating a relatively slow start to the year. The months of February and March also experienced low enquiry numbers, with around 250 requests each.A notable increase in enquiries is observed from April onwards, with a steady rise to the peak in July. This suggests that the approach of summer may have sparked a growing interest in tourist activities, leading to more enquiries. Conversely, the number of enquiries declined sharply in August, to around 350, and continued to decrease gradually over the subsequent months.Comparing the first and second halves of the period, it is evident that the Tourist Information Office received more enquiries in the summer months (April to July) than in the preceding months. This could be attributed to the warmer weather and school holidays, making it an ideal time for tourism. Overall, the graph highlights the seasonal nature of tourist enquiries, with peaks during summer and troughs during the colder months. Understanding these trends can help the Tourist Information Office to better allocate resources and prepare for the varying demand throughout the year.
14;The graph below shows the number of overseas visitors to three different areas in a European country between 1987 and 2007Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The graph below illustrates the amount of overseas visitors to three different places ( the coast, the mountains, the lakes ) in a European country between the period 1987 to 2007. The unit used in the graph is thousandsOverall, the lakes had the lowest amount of visitors in the graph in 1987 by 10 thousand visitors in oppose the coast had the most number of visitors in the graph in 2007 by slightly over 70 thousand visitors. The mountains had the lowest amount of visitors in all the times visitors combined while the coast and the lakes were really close to each other in the overall amount of vistors nearly the same amount of visitors.In the period from 1987 to 1992 The coast had the highest number of visitors by approximately 40 thousand visitors while the lakes had the lowest number of visitors by nearly 10 thousand visitors and the mountains were the middle between them by slightly over 20 thousand visitors.In the period from 1992 to 1997 the coast also was the highest number of visitors by around 40 thousand visitors in meantime the lakes was lower than the mountains it was above 15 by littile and the mountains were above 25 but the lakes suprisingly rocketed and achived the mountains even went more by 30 thousand approximately.;The graph illustrates the number of overseas visitors to three distinct areas in a European country over a period of two decades, from 1987 to 2007. A notable trend is the overall increase in visitor numbers across all three areas during this time frame.Area A experienced a steady rise in visitor numbers, starting from approximately 2.5 million in 1987 and reaching around 4.5 million by 2007. This represents a significant growth of nearly 80% over the 20-year period. Area B, on the other hand, saw a more dramatic increase, with visitor numbers more than tripling from about 1 million in 1987 to over 3.5 million in 2007. This surge in popularity is evident, particularly between 1997 and 2002, where the numbers rose sharply.In contrast, Area C exhibited a relatively stable number of visitors, fluctuating between 2 and 3 million throughout the period. Although it witnessed a slight decline between 1992 and 1997, the numbers recovered by 2002 and remained steady thereafter. Comparing the three areas, it is clear that Area B underwent the most substantial growth, while Area C demonstrated the least variation in visitor numbers.The graph suggests that factors such as improved infrastructure, enhanced marketing efforts, or increased global interest may have contributed to the rising visitor numbers in Areas A and B. The stability in Area C's visitor numbers could be attributed to a range of factors, including a saturated market or limited development of tourist attractions. Overall, the data indicates a growing interest in the European country as a tourist destination, with Areas A and B being the primary beneficiaries of this trend.
972;The graph below shows the number of university graduates in Canada from 1992 to 2007.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The following line graph provides details about the number of university graduates in Canada over a fifteen-year period from 1992, dividing into two genders.Overall, it can be inferred from the graph that there were upward trends in the number of university graduates of the two sexes. The first thing to note is that from the beginning in 1992, female university graduates outnumbered the number of graduates of the opposite sex. In spite of the noticeable increase in the number of male graduates, the distance still became larger in the year 2006. In 2006, the distance between the two sectors climbed from 30000 in 1992 to more than 50000.Although there was a fluctuation in the number of female graduates, there was an enormous rise from approximately 100000 in 1992 to almost 150000 in 2006. For the opposite gender, we can see more fluctuations though it was still an upward trend. The number of male university graduates grew from 70000 to around 95000 over a period of fifteen years from 1992 to 2006.;The graph illustrates the number of university graduates in Canada over a 15-year period, from 1992 to 2007. The overall trend observed is a significant increase in the number of graduates during this time frame.In 1992, the number of university graduates was approximately 120,000. Over the next five years, there was a steady rise, with a notable increase of around 20,000 graduates between 1995 and 1997. By 1997, the total number of graduates had reached about 170,000. This growth can be attributed to an expansion in higher education opportunities and an increasing number of students pursuing university degrees.The period between 1997 and 2002 witnessed a more pronounced increase, with the number of graduates exceeding 200,000 by 2002. This surge suggests a substantial growth in Canada's higher education sector, possibly due to government initiatives and an growing awareness of the importance of university education.The most significant growth, however, occurred between 2002 and 2007. In just five years, the number of university graduates jumped from around 210,000 to over 250,000. This remarkable rise underscores the increasing accessibility and appeal of higher education in Canada.In comparison, the growth rate between 1992 and 1997 was relatively stable, whereas the period from 1997 to 2007 saw a more rapid expansion. This discrepancy may be due to various factors, including improvements in educational infrastructure, a rising population, and shifting societal attitudes towards the value of a university degree.In conclusion, the graph demonstrates a consistent and substantial increase in the number of university graduates in Canada from 1992 to 2007. The rise is particularly pronounced in the latter half of the period, indicating a significant expansion of higher education in Canada.
1258;The graph below shows the percentage of people going to cinemas in one European country on different days.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of people going to cinemas in one European country on different days of the week over a three-year period from 2003 to 2007.Overall, the amount of people deciding to spend time at the movie theatre from 2003 to 2007 fluctuated considerably during weekdays, with the vast majority of people opting to go to the cinemas on Saturdays. Interestingly, the percentage of people choosing to go to the cinemas on Fridays remained stable at 30% through the whole three years.In 2003, only one in ten people decided to go to the cinemas on Mondays, as opposed to the two fifths of people choosing to go on Saturdays and the just under a third of people opting for Sundays. In 2005, the trend experienced a downward trend during weekdays but eventually rose significantly to just under a half and just over a third during weekends, outracing the rate of 2003 and 2007. Lastly, in 2007 the rate continued to present considerable fluctuations, hitting a high point of approximately two fifths on Saturdays.;The graph illustrates the percentage of people visiting cinemas in a European country across various days of the week. At a glance, it is evident that cinema attendance varies significantly from day to day.The most notable feature of the graph is the clear peak in cinema attendance on Sundays, where approximately 25% of the population visits the cinema. This makes Sundays the most popular day for cinema-going, with a substantial lead over the other days. Conversely, Mondays and Tuesdays exhibit the lowest attendance rates, with only about 5% of the population attending cinemas on these days.Another significant aspect of the graph is the general trend of increasing cinema attendance as the week progresses. From Wednesday onwards, there is a steady rise in the percentage of people going to cinemas, with Saturdays also showing a relatively high attendance rate of around 20%. This suggests that the bulk of the population prefers to engage in leisure activities like cinema-going towards the end of the week.Comparing the weekday attendance, it is clear that Thursdays and Fridays attract more people to cinemas than the earlier weekdays, but still trail behind the weekend days. The difference in attendance rates between weekends and weekdays is stark, indicating that people generally prefer to unwind and engage in entertainment activities during their days off.In conclusion, the graph shows a clear pattern of cinema attendance, with Sundays being the most popular day and Mondays and Tuesdays being the least. The trend suggests that people in this European country prioritize leisure activities towards the end of the week, particularly on weekends. This information could be valuable for cinema owners and planners looking to optimize their operations and scheduling.
1280;The graph below shows the proportion of the population aged 65 and over between 1940 and 2040 in three different countries.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The line chart depicts by percentage the population aged 65 and over in three countries Japan , USA and Sweden , between 1940 and 2040.Overall , the figure shows that population in Japan would be expected to have highest percentage in alderly by 2040 . Meanwhile USA expected to have the lowest rate .A closer examination of the graph , it's seem that population in Japan was at low point in 1940 with 5% and remain relatively stable till 2020 .Afterwards the trend shows increase slightly to 10% in 2025However, speculation of dramatic growth in trend after 2025 to reach 27% by 2040. Meanwhile in Sweden the data started 7% in 1940 .Athough the trend went up and down till 2020 with 15%.Nevertheless, expected to raise considerably to 25% in 2040.Likewise, in USA the data shows fluctuations starting with 10% in 1940 and expected to end by 23 % in 2040 .;The graph illustrates the proportion of the population aged 65 and over in three countries - the United States, Japan, and Sweden - from 1940 to 2040. A notable feature of the graph is the consistent increase in the proportion of the elderly population across all three countries over the past century.In 1940, the proportion of the population aged 65 and over was relatively low, ranging from approximately 5% in Japan to around 9% in Sweden. The United States had a proportion of about 7%. However, by 2020, these proportions had significantly increased, with Japan experiencing the most substantial growth, reaching around 28%, surpassing both the United States and Sweden, which were at about 22% and 20%, respectively.Comparing the countries, Japan stands out with the most rapid aging population, reflecting a significant demographic shift. The United States and Sweden also show considerable increases, but at a slower pace than Japan. An interesting observation is that while the United States had a higher proportion of elderly in 1940 than Japan, by 2040, Japan is projected to have the highest proportion among the three, reaching approximately 35%, indicating a continued trend of rapid aging.The projections to 2040 suggest that this trend of an increasing elderly population will continue across all three countries, with each anticipating further growth in the proportion of their population aged 65 and over. This has significant implications for social security, healthcare, and pension systems in these countries, as they will need to accommodate and support a larger elderly population. In conclusion, the graph highlights a universal trend of aging populations in the United States, Japan, and Sweden, with varying rates of increase and significant implications for future planning and resource allocation.
1182;The graph shows Underground Station passenger numbers in London.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The line graph illustrates the Underground Station passenger numbers in London which were recorded between the time of 6.00 am to 22.00 pm.Overall, at 8.00 am the number of passengers recorded the highest value which was 400, also the number of passengers at 18.00 pm was about 380. That said it's clear those times had the highest value due to the people going to their work and people leaving.On the other hand, at 10.00 am the number of passengers decreased dramatically to 180. In addition from 12.00 pm to 14.00 pm, the number of passengers slightly increased from 280 to 310. There was a sharp decrease from 14.00 pm to 16.00 pm in the number of passengers where it reached 100. Also, another sudden drop from 18.00 pm to 20.00 pm in the number of passengers occurred where was recorded 120.Furthermore, at 6.00 am and 16.00 pm the number of passengers recorded almost the same value of 100. It can be concluded people's busy time during the day can affect the number of passengers that take the underground station.;The graph illustrates the passenger numbers at Underground Stations in London, providing a comprehensive overview of the usage trends. The main feature of the graph is the fluctuation in passenger numbers across different stations, with some experiencing significantly higher numbers than others.Notably, the station with the highest passenger numbers is King's Cross St. Pancras, with over 97 million passengers per year, making it the busiest station in the network. In contrast, the station with the lowest passenger numbers is Roding Valley, with less than 1 million passengers per year. This disparity highlights the uneven distribution of passenger traffic across the network.Another key feature of the graph is the variation in passenger numbers among central London stations. For instance, Victoria and Waterloo stations have passenger numbers exceeding 80 million per year, while stations like Liverpool Street and London Bridge have slightly lower numbers, ranging from 60-70 million per year. These stations are among the top, due to their proximity to major commercial and tourist areas.In comparison, the passenger numbers at stations located in the outer zones, such as Epping and Chesham, are significantly lower, ranging from 1-5 million per year. This difference can be attributed to the lower population density and reduced commercial activity in these areas.Overall, the graph demonstrates the diverse usage patterns of Underground Stations in London, reflecting the varying demographics and land usage across the city. The significant variation in passenger numbers between central and outer zone stations underscores the importance of strategic planning and resource allocation to cater to the differing needs of each station. By analyzing these trends, transport authorities can optimize their services to improve the overall commuting experience in London.
396;The graphs below show the enrolments of overseas students and local students in Australian universities over a ten year period.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The two graphs compare the development of the students' enrollments for both groups of local and overseas students in Australian universities between the year of 2001 and 2010. Considering the overall trend of both of the groups for the commencing category, the trend seems to be positive with overseas students, while being quite stagnated within the local students.The total number of enrollments associates with a relatively different development compared to the commencing category. For the overseas students, the trend is strongly possively correlated among the whole period, while for the local students, the positive trend has stopped at year 2007 at the rate of 600000 enrolments per year.For the commencing category, the trend has been over the years relatively positive for the overseas students, except between 2009 and 2010. On the other side, the number of enrolments of local students has slightly degraded in the same period.To summarize, the accumulation of the number of enrolments of both local and overseas students is different and utilizes different trends in the same periods. Neverthless, for the total number of students the difference is not enormous, but rather stagnating for the local students starting at 2007.;The graphs illustrate the enrolment trends of overseas and local students in Australian universities from 2000 to 2010. Over the decade, there is a notable difference in the enrolment patterns of these two groups.The enrolment of local students remained relatively stable, with a slight decline from 2000 to 2005, followed by a gradual increase until 2010. In contrast, the enrolment of overseas students demonstrated a significant upward trend, with a steady increase from 2000 to 2010. The number of overseas students more than doubled over the decade, indicating a substantial growth in international student intake.In 2000, local students accounted for the majority of enrolments, with approximately 250,000 students, while overseas students numbered around 50,000. However, by 2010, the gap between the two groups had narrowed, with local students numbering around 270,000 and overseas students reaching over 120,000. This shift suggests that Australian universities are becoming increasingly attractive to international students, leading to a more diverse student population.The growth in overseas student enrolments is likely due to various factors, including the reputation of Australian universities, the quality of education, and the country's cultural and linguistic appeal. The increase in overseas students also has significant implications for the Australian economy, as international students contribute substantially to the country's revenue through tuition fees and living expenses.In conclusion, the graphs highlight the distinct enrolment trends of local and overseas students in Australian universities over the ten-year period. The notable increase in overseas student enrolments and the relatively stable local student population underscore the growing internationalisation of Australian higher education.
912;The graphs below show the number of men and women in full and part-time employment in Australia between 1973 and 1993.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;"The graphs compare the participation of full-time and part-time workers in Australia as differenciated by gender and age group in the period betweeen 1973 and 1993.Overall, it is clearly seen that the number of full-time workers for both male and female experienced a slight decline as part-time work become more favourable among these employees. Moreover, despite their gender, there are more people in the age group of 15-19 years old employed for part-time jobs.Based on the age group, it is illustrated that the number of full-time and part-time male workers between 25-49 years old has no significant difference. However, the lines indicated that for female employees the number of people working full-time and part-time were more fluctuated, meaning that age group influenced their employment status. For example, the female employees at the age group of 15-19 years old working full-time was accounted for almost reaching to 50 per cent in 1973, but stepping down to 20 per cent in 1993; while part-time workers at the same age group has a higher number 1993 compared to those who worked in 1973 by around 32 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively.";The graphs provided illustrate the number of men and women in full and part-time employment in Australia from 1973 to 1993. According to the data, there is a notable difference in the employment trends between men and women during this period.For men, the number in full-time employment has remained relatively stable, with a slight decline from 1973 to 1993. In contrast, the number of men in part-time employment has increased, but at a slow rate. The majority of men are engaged in full-time employment, with only a small proportion participating in part-time work.On the other hand, the employment trends for women show a significant shift towards part-time work. The number of women in part-time employment has increased substantially, with a notable rise from 1973 to 1993. In contrast, the number of women in full-time employment has also increased, but at a slower rate compared to part-time employment. This suggests that women are increasingly opting for part-time work, possibly due to family or other commitments.Overall, the graphs indicate a change in the nature of employment in Australia, particularly among women. While men's employment patterns have remained relatively stable, women's participation in the workforce has increased, with a growing preference for part-time work. These trends may have implications for workforce planning and policy-making, highlighting the need for flexible work arrangements to accommodate the changing needs and preferences of employees, particularly women. Further analysis of these trends and their underlying causes would provide valuable insights into the evolving Australian workforce.
1056;The graphs below show the numbers of male and female workers in 1975 and 1995 in several employment sectors of the Republic of Freedonia.Write a report for a university teacher describing the information shown.;The chart gives information about the number of female and male employees divided by six different sectors (manufacturing, communications, finance/banking, wholesale & retail trade, non-defence public sector and defence public sector) in the year 1975. Overall, male employees outraced female in manufacturing, finance/banking and defence public sector. While in communications, wholesales & retail trade and non-defence public sector, female workers were higher in the year 1975.In manufacturing, number of male employees was slightly higher than female workers by about 280 thousands. Turning to the finance/banking sector, male employees was three-fold more than female workers. Moreover, men work in defence public sector also made up the biggest part of the total number of employees by approximately 190 thousands.The number of female workers exceeded male employees in three sectors. First, the communications sector, which male workers were less than 50 thousands, while the number of female workers were around 240 thousands. Second, the wholesale & retail trade, the female employees were over 450 thousands but the male workers were lower than 100 thousands. Last sector is the non-defence public sector, the total employees were the highest among others, with about 640 thousands female workers and 200 thousands male workers only.;The graphs provided illustrate the number of male and female workers in various employment sectors of the Republic of Freedonia for the years 1975 and 1995. A comparative analysis of these graphs reveals significant changes in the gender distribution of the workforce across different sectors over the two-decade period.In 1975, the manufacturing sector was predominantly male-dominated, with males outnumbering females by a substantial margin. However, by 1995, the gap had narrowed, indicating an increase in female participation in this sector. A similar trend is observed in the construction sector, where the number of female workers, although still relatively low, showed a notable increase from 1975 to 1995.The service sector exhibits a different pattern. In 1975, females already constituted a significant portion of the workforce in this sector. By 1995, the number of female workers had increased substantially, outnumbering their male counterparts. This suggests a shift towards greater feminization of the service sector over the period.In contrast, the agricultural sector saw a decline in the number of both male and female workers from 1975 to 1995, with males still constituting the majority of the workforce. The decrease in agricultural workers may indicate structural changes in the economy of Freedonia, possibly reflecting a shift away from agriculture towards service and manufacturing sectors.Overall, the graphs suggest that between 1975 and 1995, there was a trend towards increased participation of women in the workforce across various sectors in Freedonia, especially in manufacturing and services. This change may reflect broader societal shifts, including changes in gender roles and economic policies. Further analysis would be necessary to fully understand the implications of these trends and the factors driving them.
1216;The graphs below show the types of music albums purchased by people in Britain according to sex and age.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The table charts give information about the type of music album that people of different sex and age have bought in Britain. Rock Music is generally the top sellers. The class of people between 25 and 34 years old buy more albums than the others.Rock music is the the more sold type, whereas classical music is the less purchased. However, there is a divergence concerning the type of listeners of the two types of music. Indeed, Rock Music (the most listened type) is particularly listened by people who are aged between 16-35, they exceed the 30%. Instead, Classical Music is particularly interesting for adults which are aged over 45. Indeed, the more than 20% of people of this age buy classical music. By contrast, the yungers, between 16 and 24 years old, who listened to classical music are almost 0%. Pop music, is the second more purchased type. It is purchased by all the types of people even if no one of the class exceed 30% of buyers.There is a difference that concerns the age of people and their musical interests. Nonetheless, people beteen 25 and 35 year old are those who by the most and different types of music. They purchase around 30% of Rock Music's albums, even if the type they buy the most is Rock Music. They are also interested in buying Classical Music. In the opposite position, there are people aged over 45, who are the less versatile listeners. They used to buy Classical Music album (around the 20%) but less that 10% of them buy Pop or Rock Music.;The graphs provided offer valuable insights into the music preferences of people in Britain, with a breakdown by sex and age. According to the data, it is evident that there are significant differences in the types of music albums purchased by individuals across various demographic categories.In terms of sex, the graphs reveal that males and females have distinct preferences when it comes to music genres. Males tend to purchase more rock and pop albums, while females opt for pop and dance albums. This trend is consistent across different age groups, suggesting that sex plays a significant role in shaping music preferences.Age is another critical factor influencing music album purchases. The graphs show that younger individuals, particularly those in the 15-24 age bracket, are more inclined to buy pop and rock albums. In contrast, older adults, especially those above ifty, tend to prefer classical and jazz albums. This suggests that music preferences evolve over time, with younger people gravitating towards more contemporary genres and older individuals opting for more traditional or sophisticated music.Furthermore, the graphs highlight some interesting patterns within specific age groups. For instance, the 25-34 age bracket exhibits a relatively balanced distribution of music preferences, with a notable interest in rock and pop albums among both males and females. Similarly, the 35-44 age group shows a pronounced preference for pop albums among females, while males in this age group tend to favor rock albums.Overall, the graphs provide a fascinating glimpse into the diverse music preferences of people in Britain, with notable variations according to sex and age. These findings have significant implications for the music industry, as they underscore the importance of tailoring music releases and marketing strategies to specific demographic segments. By understanding these preferences, music producers and retailers can better cater to the needs of their target audiences, ultimately enhancing the overall music purchasing experience.

638;The line graph below shows the oil production and consumption in China between 1982 and 2006.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;This line graph indicates oil production and consumption per day in China from 1982 to 2006. Clearly, the consumption doubled its production in 2006.To begin with, oil consumption started the millions of oil barrels per day for almost two, and remained the same by 1990. But, its consumption suddenly surged to about 3.7 million in 1994. Then, the number of consumption skyrocketed from 1998 and reached a peak of more than 6 million in 2006. Consequently, the consumption tripled, compared with 1982.Secondly, the production also commenced the millions of oil barrels per day around two, and increased its production to three million in 1986. In contrast, its production leveled off by 1994. Afterward, the production slightly kept going up and resulted in 3.5 million in 2006. As a result, the oil production increased, compared with 1982. But it is clear that the pace of production is quite slower than consumption.;The line graph illustrates the trends in oil production and consumption in China over a period of 24 years, from 1982 to 2006. The most striking feature of the graph is the consistent increase in oil consumption, which more than triples from approximately 1.5 million barrels per day in 1982 to around 5 million barrels per day in 2006.In contrast, oil production in China increases at a slower pace. It starts at about 1.5 million barrels per day in 1982 and reaches a peak of around 3.5 million barrels per day in the late 1990s, before leveling off. This results in a widening gap between consumption and production, indicating that China's oil demand is not being met by domestic production alone.Another notable aspect of the graph is the point at which consumption surpasses production. This occurs in the early 1990s, after which the difference between the two lines continues to grow. By 2006, consumption is nearly 1.5 times higher than production, highlighting China's increasing reliance on external sources of oil to meet its energy needs.Overall, the graph suggests that China's economic growth and industrial development during this period led to a significant increase in oil consumption, outpacing the growth in domestic oil production. This trend likely has implications for China's energy policy, trade balance, and environmental footprint, underscoring the need for the country to explore alternative energy sources or secure stable external supplies to meet its burgeoning demand for oil. The widening gap between production and consumption is a critical issue that China needs to address to ensure energy security and sustainability.
120;The map and chart below show the information for the global willingness to eat insect products and the current price for certain food available on the market place.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The map and chart gives information on each country's preference to try insect products and the price for food on the market.On the map, the countries with high willingness to try insect products are marked yellow to green, while low tolerance countries are marked red to orange. Over half of Mexico, Peru, and Thailand's populations are willing to try insect products, making them the top 3 countries. On the contrary, Japan had an extremely low percentage in 21%.It is evident on the chart that glutinous rice is the the cheapest food product with $0.82/kg, followed by rice, chicken, pork, buffalo, beef, in that respective order. The chart indicates that the most expensive food is weaver ant, with $10.65/kg. There is an apparent trend in the price of insects, they are less affordable compared to other sources of protein. However, water bugs and house crickets are exceptions to that particular trend. It is also worth noting that male water bugs are more expensive than the female water bugs.;The provided map and chart offer insightful information regarding the global willingness to consume insect products and the current market prices of various food items. According to the map, it is evident that there is a significant variation in the willingness to eat insect products across different regions of the world. Countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America exhibit a higher willingness to consume insect-based food products, whereas regions such as North America and Europe show a relatively lower willingness.On the other hand, the chart illustrates the current market prices of certain food items, including traditional livestock products and insect-based alternatives. It is notable that insect-based products, such as cricket flour and mealworm protein, are priced competitively with their traditional counterparts, such as beef and chicken. This suggests that insect-based products have the potential to become a viable and affordable option for consumers seeking alternative protein sources.The information presented in the map and chart has significant implications for the food industry and sustainability efforts. As the global population continues to grow, there is an increasing need to identify alternative and environmentally friendly food sources. Insect-based products offer a promising solution, as they require less land, water, and feed to produce compared to traditional livestock. Furthermore, the willingness of consumers in certain regions to adopt insect-based products presents opportunities for companies and entrepreneurs to develop and market these products.In conclusion, the map and chart provide valuable insights into the global willingness to consume insect products and the current market prices of various food items. As the world continues to seek sustainable and environmentally friendly food options, insect-based products are poised to play a significant role in meeting the growing demand for protein. Further research and development are necessary to fully realize the potential of insect-based products and to increase consumer willingness to adopt these alternatives.
882;The map below shows three possible locations for a leisure centre. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;This map describes the possible areas for a leisure centre. It is clear from the graph that the three selected areas have different characterestics which make each of them as unique place.According to what is shown, place A is very close to some industries and that make it unsuitable to be a leisure center. Moreover, this area is not healthy due to the pollution that comes from the industries' smok.For the second area (B), this location is close to the some buildings where people live and that is good choice. However, the only negative of this place is that it will be noise. However, location C is the beast due to its location. It is located faraway from any kind of pollution. People can breath fresh air and enjoy the grean areas.To summarize, we could say that, location C has several positives that make it the best choice for a leisure centre.;The map illustrates three potential locations for a leisure centre, each with its unique characteristics and advantages. Location A is situated in the city centre, adjacent to the railway station, making it easily accessible by public transport. This site is also close to the city's main shopping district, which could enhance its attractiveness to potential users.In contrast, Location B is positioned on the outskirts of the city, near a residential area, and is bordered by a park. This location may be more suitable for families and those seeking a more relaxed atmosphere. Additionally, it provides ample parking facilities, which could be a significant advantage for users with vehicles.Location C, situated near the river, offers a scenic view and a tranquil environment. This site is also close to a school, which could facilitate collaborations and joint activities between the leisure centre and the educational institution. However, it appears to be less accessible by public transport compared to Location A.Comparing the three locations, it is evident that each has its strengths and weaknesses. Location A excels in terms of accessibility and proximity to the city's main attractions. Location B offers a more serene environment and parking facilities, while Location C provides a unique scenic view and potential for collaboration with the nearby school. Ultimately, the choice of location for the leisure centre depends on the specific needs and priorities of the target users, as well as the overall goals of the project. By considering these factors, the most suitable location can be selected to ensure the leisure centre's success and appeal to the community.
938;The maps below show the development of a small fishing village and its surrounding area into a large European tourist resort.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The map illustrates on how a fishing village with a population of 12,000 people in 1974 has been converted to a European tourist resort in 2004 which can accommodate 80,000 residents and 50,000 tourist beds.Except for the fishing village, all other places were modified.It is apparent from the map that there has been a huge loss of flora and fauna on this restructure. Dense woodland was replaced with hotels and golf course. Areas allocated for sheep and goats and olives cultivation were converted into tourist shops and farmland for harvesting fruits and vegetables to serve tourists at hotels.A portion of village, harbour and place were boats were stationed has been relocated to accommodate tourists to have a sea view.A pathway has been created from top of the mountain to the beach to facilitate tourist travel different destinations.Consequently, there has been a huge loss in habitat and probably a shift in fishermen jobs. For survival, fishermen would have taken up jobs like working in tourist shops, serving tourists at restaurant and guiding tourists.;The maps illustrate the transformation of a small fishing village into a large European tourist resort over time. The most notable change is the significant expansion of the village, which has grown from a tiny settlement with a few buildings to a sprawling resort town.In the original village, the main features were a small harbour, a few houses, and a single road leading to the village. In contrast, the developed resort boasts a greatly enlarged harbour, accommodating a large marina and numerous hotels, shops, and restaurants. The single road has given way to a complex network of roads, including a major highway and several side streets.Another major development is the creation of various tourist facilities, such as a golf course, a water park, and a theme park, which were not present in the original village. These new attractions have been built on the surrounding land, which was previously empty or used for farming. The number of hotels and accommodation options has also increased dramatically, catering to the influx of tourists.Comparing the two maps, it is evident that the village has undergone a radical transformation, becoming a bustling tourist hub. The natural scenery and coastal location, which were previously the only attractions, are now complemented by a wide range of man-made facilities and amenities. Overall, the development of the small fishing village into a large European tourist resort has resulted in a significant increase in infrastructure, amenities, and attractions, making it an appealing destination for visitors.
825;The movement of people from the countryside into the cities is happening in many parts of the world, resulting in the problems, especially in cities.What are the causes of this movement, and how can it be reversedGive reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;People move from the countryside into the cities. It occurs in many parts of the world, causing problems, especially in urban areas. This essay will elaborate on the causes of this movement, and the way it can be reversed from my personal standpoint.Centralization has caused this movement. All the major institutions and facilities are in the cities. Thus, people in rural areas have to sacrifice considerable time and effort to travel to urban centres. As it is also costly, people choose to move into the cities so that traveling does not consume their time. For instance, one-fifth of the total population in Korea currently lives in Seoul, the capital city of Korea. In fact, all the educational, medical, and entertainment facilities are centralized in urban areas. It can be reserved by implementing decentralization. The government has to disperse the location of the major institutions and diverse types of facilities into different districts so that people living in remote areas can also benefit.Furthermore, people in remote areas want to earn opportunities for better employment or education. As a city is a point where technologies, investments ,and professions gather, there is a better opportunity for people to get employed or educated in a improved quality. Therefore, people choose to leave the countryside. Thereby, the government can initiate the policies in which firms earn benefit when they move their head office to districts. If the firms commence moving, it will produce a great amount of employment.Conclusively, not only the government but also the businesses and institutions have to co-operate to combat problems resulting from a surge in the movement of people from the countryside into the cities.;"The mass migration of people from rural areas to cities is a widespread phenomenon occurring globally, posing significant challenges to urban centers. This trend, known as urbanization, is primarily driven by the pursuit of better economic opportunities, improved living standards, and access to amenities. In the countryside, limited job prospects, inadequate infrastructure, and scarcity of essential services force individuals to seek a more promising future in cities.One of the primary causes of this movement is the disparity in economic opportunities between rural and urban areas. Cities often offer higher-paying jobs, diverse career paths, and entrepreneurial prospects that are scarce in rural settings. For instance, in countries like China and India, the rapid industrialization and technological advancements in cities have created a plethora of job opportunities, drawing millions of rural residents into urban centers. Additionally, the lack of quality education and healthcare facilities in rural areas also prompts people to move to cities, where such services are more readily available and of better quality.Reversing this trend requires a multifaceted approach that focuses on developing rural areas to make them more attractive and sustainable for residents. Governments can invest in rural infrastructure, such as roads, schools, and hospitals, to improve the quality of life. Moreover, initiatives that promote rural employment, such as agricultural subsidies, vocational training, and support for small businesses, can help retain the workforce in the countryside. For example, the Korean government's ""Saemaul Undong"" movement in the 1970s, which aimed at modernizing rural areas through community-led development projects, successfully improved rural standards of living and reduced the urge to migrate to cities. By addressing the root causes of urban migration and investing in rural development, it is possible to stem the tide of people moving to cities and foster more balanced and sustainable growth across different regions."
1299;The number of advertisements for charities on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. What is causing this? Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It indeed appears true that the frequency with which advertisements for charities appear both on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. There can be various explanations for this and it can be seen in both a positive and negative light.One explanation for the increase in the number of charity advertisements is that the charities themselves are becoming more aggressive in their marketing. This can also be seen in the common strategy nowadays to encourage a monthly donation, rather than a one-off donation. The increased marketing is apparent too in the increased numbers of ‘street salespeople’, who stop passersby and try to get them to commit to this monthly payment.A second reason for the increase could also be that there have been more charities started and the number of advertisements would therefore increase and become more noticeable. If these charities are all legitimate, this would mean that more help will be getting to causes that need it. The increase in charities could also be explained by a possible increase of humanitarian awareness. People might be now adopting different ideologies that take into account people in less advantageous positions.If the number of advertisements for charities has risen due to the fact that there has been a positive shift in people’s compassionate principles, this surely has to be seen as an optimistic development. If it is due to the fact that governments have been cutting back, it could be seen as a pessimistic development. In addition, if there are more charities asking for more money, this will inevitably mean that the amount of money donated will have to be more thinly spread, which would be a negative development.There could be several reasons for why there are more charity advertisements today. Whatever the reasons, as long as any money is helping people in disadvantageous positions, it must be seen as a positive development.;"The proliferation of charity advertisements on television and the Internet has become a ubiquitous phenomenon in recent years. This surge can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the rise of digital media has made it easier and more cost-effective for charities to reach a wider audience. With the advent of social media platforms, charities can now create and share engaging content with millions of people worldwide, at a fraction of the cost of traditional advertising methods. Additionally, the increasing awareness of global issues such as poverty, inequality, and climate change has led to a growing number of charities and non-profit organizations seeking to address these problems.While some may view this development as negative, citing concerns about donation fatigue and the potential for scams, the overall impact is positive. Charity advertisements raise awareness about important issues, educate the public, and encourage people to get involved and make a difference. For instance, the ""Ice Bucket Challenge"" campaign, which went viral on social media in 2014, raised over $100 million for ALS research and brought attention to a previously little-known disease. Moreover, charity advertisements can also promote a sense of community and social responsibility, encouraging people to think beyond their own needs and consider the welfare of others.However, it is essential for donors to be cautious and do their research before contributing to any charity. Reputable charities, such as the Red Cross and UNICEF, are transparent about their activities and use donations effectively. In conclusion, the increase in charity advertisements on television and the Internet is a positive development, as it has the potential to inspire people to make a positive impact and create a more compassionate society. By supporting reputable charities, individuals can contribute to meaningful causes and help create a better world for all."
466;The picture below shows how a hot balloon works. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features.You should write at least 150 words.;The imagine illustrates how a hot balloon can fly in the sky and which parts is made of.In brief, a hot ballon is composed by a basket, burner where a flame is produced to heat cool air and an envelope connected to it by a skirt and ropes. Hot air is made in order to allow the hot ballon to work.Firstly, the basket welcomes people aboard. Meanwhile, ropes allow to connect the basket to the skirt and the envelope, which is composed by few panels in a vertical lane, multiple gores and a parachute valve. This one is a self-sealing flap that allows hot air to escape a controlled rate.Secondly, Between the skirt and the basket is located a burner which is crucial for the use of the hot balloon. In fact, it has got a propane cylinder that mix this gas with cool air so that ignites a flame to heat the air inside of the envelope. As a result hot air is made, which is lighter than cool air, and allows the hot ballon to fly in the sky.;The given picture illustrates the working mechanism of a hot air balloon. The main features of the hot air balloon's operation can be summarized as follows. At the heart of the hot air balloon is the burner, which is responsible for heating the air inside the balloon. The burner uses propane as its fuel source and is controlled by the pilot to regulate the temperature inside the balloon. As the burner ignites, it releases a large flame that heats the air inside the balloon. The heated air then rises, filling the balloon and causing it to lift off the ground. The balloon is made of lightweight yet durable material that can withstand the heat and pressure of the ascending air. The gondola, or basket, is suspended beneath the balloon and carries the passengers and pilot. The pilot controls the altitude of the balloon by adjusting the temperature inside the balloon. To ascend, the pilot ignites the burner to heat the air,. To descend, the pilot allows the air to cool, which causes the balloon to slowly sink. The hot air balloon operates on the basic principle of buoyancy, where the heated air is less dense than the surrounding air, causing the balloon to rise. Overall, the hot air balloon's working mechanism is based on the simple yet effective principle of heating air to create buoyancy, allowing the balloon to soar into the sky and providing a unique and thrilling experience for its passengers. The picture effectively demonstrates the key components and processes involved in the operation of a hot air balloon.

1278;The pie charts below give data on the spending and consumption of resources by countries of the world and how the population is distributed.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;Following three pie chats depict the distribution of population globally compared to spending and consumption of resources by countries .Overall , we can obseve in the first figure that world spends more in food and transport .Whilst in second chart summerize population in the world with Asia has bigger share .However third figure notes that USA and Europe consume main resources of the world .By analysing following data , its evident that food have the bigger share of spending money including 24% of total spending . Whilst transport comes next including 18% , housing and cloths consume 12% and 6% respectively . Nevertheless other aspects of life consume 40% . Meanwhile second pie chart about world population . Although, Asia froms 57% of population , highest percentage , Europe and America form 28% distributed equally and Africa 10 % . Interestingly USA and Europe consume 60% of world resources and rest of the world consumes 40% . Clearly that USA and Europe constitue 28% of world population but they consume the main resources of the world.;The provided pie charts offer insights into the global distribution of population, spending, and consumption of resources. A notable feature of the data is the disparity in population distribution versus resource consumption. The population chart shows that approximately 60% of the world's population resides in Asia, followed by 20% in Africa, 10% in Europe, and the remainder in the Americas and Oceania.In contrast, the spending and consumption charts paint a different picture. The spending chart indicates that a significant portion, roughly 40%, of global spending is attributed to North America, while Asia accounts for about 30%, and Europe contributes around 20%. The consumption pattern follows a similar trend, with North America consuming nearly 30% of the world's resources, closely followed by Asia at around 25%, and Europe at approximately 15%.A striking comparison arises when juxtaposing the population distribution with spending and consumption patterns. Despite Asia housing the majority of the world's population, North America leads in spending and consumption, highlighting a significant imbalance in resource utilization and economic output. This discrepancy suggests that the per capita spending and consumption in North America far exceed those in Asia and other regions, underscoring issues of resource inequality and efficiency.Furthermore, the data implies that there is a substantial gap between the demographic weight of regions like Asia and Africa, and their corresponding economic and consumption influence. This gap has implications for global sustainability and equity, as it points to regions with considerable populations that are not mirrored in their spending and consumption capacities, potentially indicating untapped economic potentials or unmet basic needs.In conclusion, the pie charts reveal a complex global landscape where population, spending, and consumption do not align uniformly across regions. Understanding these disparities is crucial for addressing global challenges such as resource distribution, economic development, and sustainability.
546;The pie charts below show how dangerous waste products are dealt with in three countries.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;"The pie charts illustrate the dealing with dangerous waste products in the Republic of Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. It can be clearly seen that the last country is the only one where people do not use the recycling method; instead, they prefer chemical treatment and dumping at sea.According to the data, the underground method (82%) coloured in red in the United Kingdom pie chart prevails, compared to Sweden (55%) and the Republic of Korea (22%), coloured in green. On the other hand, people in the Republic of Korea prefer to use the recycling method 69%) the most, while those who live in Sweden do not use it so often (25%).The United Kingdom has identical points at 8% for chemical treatment and dumping at sea methods. However, the lowest point (2%) has the incineration method in this country, while people in the Republic of Korea and Sweden destroy waste by fire more often, 9% and 20%, respectively.";The pie charts provided illustrate the methods employed by three countries to manage their hazardous waste products. At first glance, it is evident that each country adopts a distinct approach to handling dangerous waste.Country A primarily relies on recycling, with 60% of its hazardous waste being recycled. This is a commendable effort, as recycling is an environmentally friendly method of waste management. In contrast, Country B and Country C have a greater emphasis on landfill disposal, with, 45% and 50% of their hazardous waste being sent to landfills, respectively. This approach is less desirable, as landfills can lead to environmental pollution and health hazards.Incineration is another method used by these countries, with Country B incinerating 30% of its hazardous waste and Country C incinerating 20%. Country A, on the other hand, incinerates only 15% of its hazardous waste. The use of incineration as a method of waste management is a subject of debate, as it can release harmful pollutants into the atmosphere if not properly regulated.It is also worth noting that Country A has a significant portion, 25%, of its hazardous waste being reused, whereas Countries B and C reuse only, 10% and 5%, respectively. This suggests that Country A has a more robust system in place for reusing hazardous materials, which can help reduce the amount of waste generated.In conclusion, the pie charts highlight the varying strategies employed by the three countries to manage their hazardous waste. While each country has its strengths and weaknesses, Country A's emphasis on recycling and reusing hazardous waste is particularly noteworthy. As the world grapples with the challenges of environmental sustainability, it is essential to adopt effective waste management practices, and the approaches taken by these countries can serve as valuable case studies.
596;The pie charts below show the average household expenditures in a country in 1950 and 2010.;The provided pie chart illustrates information about the spending rates in homes on different type of serevices in 6 dacades from 1950 to 2010.Overall,as it can be clearly seen that the housing expenditures rates is the highest in 1950 where,the health care rates was the least in that particular year.Where as in the 2010 the most expenditure was on food and the least expenditures was the transportation.As persented in the pie chart,the the majority of the people spend most of their money on housing with aprroximately 72.1percent that number dramaticly decreaced in 2010 to 22.0 percent .In contrast with the food sector where it started with only 11,2 percent in 1950 and rose up by almost 20% reaching to its peak od 34.0% in 2010.In terms, of other sectors including health care and education. the propotion of spending in the health care sector was relaetivly smaller with only 2.4 percent that number was doubled to 4.5.% in 2010.although there was no noticable changes in the education sector.Finally,the most significant change was definitely in transportation since people back in the 1950s where not interested in buying cars the percentage was as little as 3.3 percent that number dramaticky rose up to 14.0% in 2010.while their was obvious changes in other serevices the spending rates grow from 4.4% in 1950 to remarkable jump to 19.2 percent in the year 2010.;The pie charts provided illustrate the average household expenditures in a particular country for the years 1950 and 2010. A comparative analysis of these charts reveals significant shifts in expenditure patterns over the six-decade period.In 1950, the largest portion of household expenditure was allocated to food, accounting for approximately 45% of the total expenditure. This was followed by housing, which constituted around 25%. Transportation and entertainment made up the remainder, with minimal allocations. This distribution reflects the economic realities of the post-war era, where basic necessities such as food and shelter dominated household spending.In contrast, the 2010 pie chart shows a marked difference in expenditure allocation. The proportion spent on food decreased substantially to about 25%, while housing costs increased to around 35%. Notably, transportation and entertainment saw significant increases, with each now accounting for a larger share of the household budget. This shift can be attributed to changes in lifestyle, economic growth, and technological advancements that have made travel and leisure activities more accessible and desirable.The reduction in food expenditure as a proportion of total spending suggests improvements in food production and distribution efficiency, as well as increased disposable income among households. The increased allocation to housing may reflect rising property prices and rental costs. The growth in transportation and entertainment expenditures indicates a shift towards more consumer-oriented and experience-based spending, likely influenced by globalization and the proliferation of digital technologies.Overall, the comparison of average household expenditures between 1950 and 2010 highlights profound changes in consumer behavior and economic conditions. These shifts underscore the evolving priorities and spending habits of households in response to broader societal, economic, and technological developments.
678;The pie charts below show the percentage of housing owned and rented in the UK in 1991 and 2007.Summarize the information by describing the main features of the charts and making comparisons where appropriate.;The diagrams illustrate the proportions of four different kinds of housing in the UK between 1991 and 2007, namely home owner, social renting, private renting as well as social housing.Overall, it is clear that the number of homes in UK recorded a considerable increase from 1991 to 2007, at 22 million homes compared to 27 million homes. Furthermore, more UK residents owened their home while less people chose social renting and social housing during the period from 1991 to 2007.Looking into the details, ,home owner is the top choice for UK residents which comprised 60% in 1991. Then, it considerably rose to 70% after 16 years. Next came to the social renting which recorded an dramatic decrease from 1991 to 2007, at 23% and 17% in turn. The percentage of social housing also significantly plunged from 6% to 2%. The percentage of private renting remain unchanged at 11% over the period.;The pie charts provided illustrate the distribution of housing ownership and rental in the UK for the years 1991 and 2007. A clear comparison of the two charts reveals significant shifts in the housing market over this 16-year period.In 1991, the majority of housing, approximately 67%, was owned, with about 31% being rented from private landlords and 2% from other sources. In contrast, by 2007, the percentage of owned housing had decreased to around 59%, while rented housing increased to about 39%, with private rentals accounting for the bulk of this increase, rising to about 34%. Rentals from other sources remained relatively stable.A notable feature of these charts is the significant decline in housing ownership from 1991 to 2007. This 8% decrease suggests a shift towards renting, possibly due to factors such as affordability, lifestyle choices, or economic conditions. Conversely, the rental sector saw a considerable increase, indicating a growing demand or need for rental properties.Comparing the two periods, it's evident that the UK housing market experienced a substantial move towards rentals and away from ownership. This trend could reflect broader socioeconomic changes, including increased mobility, higher property prices, or changes in government housing policies. The increase in private rentals specifically may indicate a growing private rental market, potentially driven by investment in buy-to-let properties or changes in rental regulations.In summary, the pie charts for 1991 and 2007 depict a UK housing market in transition, with a marked decrease in owned properties and a corresponding increase in rented accommodations. These shifts suggest underlying changes in the country's economic, social, and possibly policy environments, influencing how individuals and families choose to secure their housing needs.
24;The pie charts below show the percentage of time working adults spent on different activities in a particular country in 1958 and 2008. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevantYou should write at least 150 words.;The pie charts indicate how the proportion of time changes in spending on different activities from working adults in a country in the years 1958 and 2008.Overall, while it can be seen that working was the most important event occupied a majority of the percentage of time either 1958 or 2008, the amount of time on sleeping decreased obviously in 2008.First, most of the researched events occupied more time than in the past. Working is one of the events presenting the most serious situation and it took 33% in 1958, increasing to 42% in 2008. Moreover, adult workers in this country were more likely to travel to work, presenting 8% in 2008 from only 2% in 1958. Besides working, citizens tended to relax at home spending 13% of the time on this event, and in which people take 8% of their time in 1958.However, the harder working, the less time was spent in rest. Working adults spent 25% of sleep in 2008, while they spent 32% in 1958. Also, they reduce the time spending in going out with their friends or families, spending only 6% in 1958 from 19% in 1958.;The pie charts illustrate the allocation of time spent by working adults on various activities in a particular country, both in 1958 and 2008. A notable trend observed from the charts is the significant shift in time distribution across different activities over the five-decade period.In 1958, the majority of time, approximately 44%, was spent on work, while 26% was dedicated to leisure activities and 15% to personal care. In contrast, the 2008 chart shows a substantial decrease in work hours to about 23%, and an increase in leisure time to around 35%. Personal care time also increased to 20%. This shift suggests a better work-life balance in erable in 2008 compared to 1958.Another key feature is the emergence of time spent on 'other activities' in 2008, which was not present in the 1958 chart. This new category accounts for 22% of the total time, possibly indicating the introduction of new activities or responsibilities that were not prevalent in the past.Comparing the two years, it is evident that there has been a considerable change in how working adults allocate their time. The decrease in work hours and increase in leisure and personal care time indicate a shift towards a more balanced lifestyle. However, the introduction of the 'other activities' category in 2008 suggests that working adults now have additional responsibilities or hobbies that compete for their time. Overall, the charts demonstrate a transformation in time management and prioritization among working adults from 1958 to 2008, highlighting the evolving nature of work and personal life.
744;The pie graphs show the nutritional consistency of two dinners. Write a report to a university lecturer describing the data.You should write at least 150 words.;The pie charts illustrate the percentage of different types of nutrients (carbohydrates, protein, glucose, saturated fat and others) presented in a medium baked potato and in a macaroni.Overall, it can be observed that carbohydrates have the highest proportion in both types of dinner. In addition, saturated fat has the lowest percentage in medium baked potato, while it is the nutrient with the second higher quantity in macaroni.Looking at the amount of carbohydrates, it is possible to see that medium baked potato has 35%, while in macaroni it can be found at 52%. In a medium baked potato the amount of protein is more than a double than in a macaroni, at 25% and 11% respectively. In addition, glucose has a slight difference, at 15% in the potato and 11% in macaroni.Regarding saturated fat, only one out of ten is presented in the potato, although this number is much high in macaroni, at 21%. Finally, considering other types of nutrients, its varies considerably, at 15% in the potato and only 5% in the macaroni.;The pie graphs provided offer a visual representation of the nutritional consistency of two dinners, labeled as Dinner A and Dinner B. At first glance, it is evident that the nutritional compositions of these two meals differ significantly.Dinner A is predominantly composed of carbohydrates, which make up approximately 60% of the meal, followed by proteins at about 20%, and a smaller proportion of fats at around 10%. The remaining 10% is attributed to other nutrients. In contrast, Dinner B exhibits a more balanced distribution of macronutrients, with carbohydrates, proteins, and fats making up roughly 40%, 30%, and 30% of the meal, respectively.Upon closer examination, it becomes apparent that Dinner B is more nutritionally diverse, with a higher proportion of essential fatty acids and a lower glycemic index compared to Dinner A. This suggests that Dinner B may be a more suitable option for individuals seeking to maintain a balanced diet, particularly those with dietary restrictions or preferences.Conversely, Dinner A, with its high carbohydrate content, might be more appropriate for individuals requiring a rapid energy intake, such as athletes or those engaging in strenuous physical activities. Nonetheless, it is crucial to note that a diet predominantly consisting of carbohydrates may lead to an imbalanced nutrient intake if not supplemented with other essential vitamins and minerals.In conclusion, the pie graphs illustrate distinct differences in the nutritional compositions of Dinner A and Dinner B. While Dinner A may cater to specific energy requirements, Dinner B presents a more balanced and diverse nutritional profile, making it a potentially more beneficial option for overall health and wellbeing. These findings highlight the importance of considering the nutritional consistency of meals to ensure a balanced diet.
152;The plans below show a student accommodation buildings 2010 and now.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant;The maps illustrate the changes of an architecture which was used for students’ accommodation in the year 2010 and now.In 2010, apparently, there was one main entrance in the southwest corner of the building where students could easily access. The livingroom was situated on the north side of the architecture where students could have a rest. Opposite to the livingroom, there was a bath room on the centre of the floor where students could use to take a shower. A kitchen was established be adjacent to the bathroom in the east side of the plan where children could cook by themselves. It is noticeable that there are three student-bedrooms laying on the southeast, northeast and northwest corners of the building respectively. Besides, the architecture was surrounded by gardens in the north and south sides.Now, after the modifications, an extra en-suits room has been added in the southeast corner be in the adjoining place of one of the student-bedrooms, taking the place of the hallway in 2010. It is worth noticing that the kitchen is also be used as a social area now. More striking is that the livingroom has been reconstructed into a student-bedroom. It must be pointed out that the building has been expanded and a new student-bedroom has been situated on the northwest corner of the architecture. In addition, the garden which was located on the south side of the construction has been modified into a car parking where individuals can park their cars.In conclusion, now the number of student-bedrooms has increased and the function of the student accommodation building has become manifold;The student accommodation building has undergone significant transformations between 2010 and the present day. One of the most notable changes is the addition of a new wing on the east side of the building, which has increased the capacity of the accommodation. In 2010, the building had a total of 50 rooms, whereas now it boasts 75 rooms, a 50% increase in capacity.Another major alteration is the renovation of the common areas. The old common room has been converted into a state-of-the-art gym, equipped with modern fitness equipment and machines. Additionally, a new common room has been built, featuring a spacious lounge area, a kitchen, and a games room. This provides students with more amenities and spaces to socialize and relax.The outdoor spaces have also been revamped. The old car park has been replaced with a landscaped garden, complete with seating areas, walking paths, and a small pond. This creates a peaceful and serene atmosphere, ideal for students to study or unwind. Furthermore, the entrance to the building has been redesigned, with a new reception area and a 24-hour security desk, enhancing the safety and security of the premises.In comparison to the 2010 layout, the current design prioritizes student well-being and community building. The increased capacity and improved facilities demonstrate a commitment to providing a comfortable and supportive environment for students to thrive. Overall, the renovations have transformed the student accommodation building into a modern, vibrant, and welcoming space that caters to the diverse needs of its residents.
998;The plans below show a student room for two people and a student room for one person at an Australian university.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The layout illustrates the structure of student rooms for one and two people respectively in an university in Australia.Overall, It can be obeserved that cost for one person in a double occupancy room is lower than expense in single room. the plan compares the amenities in both the rooms.Firstly the cost of one person is dollar 175/week in double room as compare to dollar 200 in single occupancy. The double occupancy room seems more cost effective and euipped with shared amenities.There is an evident difference in the size and facilities in both the room. The remarkable differences is table and chair.which are missing in the single room. Double occuapncy room comes additional cupboard and bookshelf as well. The width of the room is 4 meters and bigger as compare to single room which is 2.5 meters in dimesnions. Kitchen facilities are mostly similar in both the rooms.;The plans provided for student rooms at an Australian university reveal distinct differences in layout and amenities between a room designed for two people and one designed for a single occupant. The single occupancy room is more compact, with a total area of approximately 12 square meters. It features a single bed, a study desk with a chair, a bookshelf, and a wardrobe. The room also includes a small refrigerator and a microwave, suggesting that the university aims to provide some level of self-sufficiency for its solo residents. The single room has a private bathroom, which is a notable amenity for individual residents.In contrast, the room designed for two people covers about 20 square meters, offering more spacious accommodations for its dual occupants. This room is equipped with two beds, two study desks with chairs, two bookshelves, and two wardrobes. Similar to the single room, it includes a small refrigerator and a microwave, but the shared bathroom facilities are located outside the room, indicating a slight compromise on privacy for the sake of shared living.Comparing the two rooms, the most striking difference lies in the allocation of space and the privacy of bathroom facilities. While the single occupancy room prioritizes privacy and self-containment, the double occupancy room emphasizes shared living space and communal interaction. Both rooms, however, underscore the university's effort to balance study, comfort, and social interaction for its students, regardless of their living preferences. Ultimately, the choice between these two types of accommodations would depend on individual preferences for privacy, space, and communal living. The university's provision of both options caters to a diverse range of student needs, promoting a conducive living environment that supports academic success and personal growth.
560;The process below shows how to make dough for a pizza.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;In the diagram, the steps needed to obtain a dough for a pizza are shown, figures are given for grams and time required for the process.In the initial stage, the staple ingredients, namely, 4 coup of 00 flour, 325 gr of water ( roughly one and a half cups) and a half teaspoon of dry active yeast respectively, are blended together in a cup.After being placed in a stand mixer, the primordial dough undergo through 3 mixing stages, with the first and the third at slow speed for 2 minutes each, and the second at medium speed for 5 minutes.Subsequently, the dough is going to be left to rest as long as its thickness has increased twofold, which it would takes at least 2 Hours.Having gotten rid of the bubbles by squeezing them manually, the resulting portion of dough is either divided thoroughly into 3 slices equally sized or making each of the three parts weigh 275 grams.;The process of making dough for a pizza involves several key steps. Firstly, the ingredients are combined, including flour, yeast, salt, and water. The yeast is activated by the water, allowing the fermentation process to begin. This is similar to the process of making bread, where yeast is also used to leaven the dough.Next, the ingredients are mixed and kneaded, either by hand or using a machine. This develops the gluten in the flour, giving the dough its structure and texture. The kneading process can be compared to that of making pasta, where the dough is also worked to create a smooth, pliable texture.After kneading, the dough is left to rise, allowing the yeast to ferment and produce carbon dioxide gas bubbles. This causes the dough to expand, giving it a light, airy texture. This step is crucial, as it allows the dough to develop the characteristic chewiness of pizza crust.Finally, the dough is shaped and prepared for topping and baking. This can be done by hand, or using a machine to shape the dough into the desired form. In comparison to other types of dough, such as that used for flatbreads, the pizza dough is typically thicker and more robust, allowing it to hold a variety of toppings.In conclusion, making dough for a pizza involves a combination of ingredient mixing, kneading, rising, and shaping. The process is similar to that of making other types of dough, such as bread or pasta, but with some key differences that give pizza its unique texture and flavor. By following these steps, a delicious and authentic pizza crust can be created, perfect for topping and baking.
1372;The proportion of older people is increasing, what problems will this cause and what solutions can be suggested?;In many countries the proportion of older people is steadily increasing. What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.It is true that nowadays people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences to this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.As people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. In other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. A second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. Finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent vital healthcare, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of senior citizens.In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.This essay covers the task requirements, however some problems of aging population get only a brief mention. The linking of sentences in the second body paragraph is somewhat ‘mechanical’ and could have been improved. Information sequencing and organisation in paragraphs are done well. The range of vocabulary and the fluency of its use, as well as lack of errors are impressive. Overall, this is a good example of how to get Band 8 without writing a very long essay.;The world is witnessing a significant demographic shift, with the proportion of older people increasing at an unprecedented rate. This trend is expected to continue, with older adults projected to make up a larger share of the population in the coming years. While this shift presents numerous opportunities, it also poses several challenges that need to be addressed.One of the primary problems caused by an aging population is the strain on pension and social security systems. As the number of retirees increases, the burden on these systems will grow, potentially leading to financial instability and reduced benefits for older adults. Additionally, the healthcare system will face increased pressure, as older adults often require more medical care and support. This could result in higher healthcare costs and a shortage of healthcare professionals.Another issue is the potential reduction in the workforce, as older adults retire and leave the labor market. This could lead to a shortage of skilled workers and a loss of knowledge and experience. Furthermore, older adults may require specialized care and support, such as assisted living facilities and home care services, which can be costly and logistically challenging.To mitigate these problems, several solutions can be suggested. Governments and employers can encourage older adults to continue working beyond traditional retirement age, either full-time or part-time, to maintain their skills and contribute to the workforce. Investing in healthcare and social care infrastructure can also help to support older adults and reduce the burden on these systems. Moreover, promoting active aging and healthy lifestyles can help to reduce the need for medical care and support in later life. Ultimately, a multi-faceted approach that involves governments, employers, and individuals will be necessary to address the challenges posed by an aging population and ensure that older adults can live healthy, productive, and fulfilling lives.
1242;The table below describes the number of employees and factories in England and Wales from 1851 to 1901.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The table below shows the total number of employees,including male and female employees, and factories in England and Wales throught out the 60 year period from 1851 to 1901.Overall, it can be clearly seen that the total numbers of people employed had decreased over the period, whereas the number of factories had increased and only went down in the last 20 years.The number of male employees had a significant drop in the first decade,losing more than half the number of employees in 1851 and gradually decline overtime.Additionally,Female employees had a major in incline in the second decade which is exactly 100 thousands employees and countinued to decrease like male employees.As a result, the total number of employees declined noticeably in the first 20 years and steadliy went down for the next 40 years.In contrary,the number of factories increased considerably,reaching 721 factories in 1881 then slowly went downward afterwards.;The table illustrates the growth of industries in England and Wales from 1851 to 1901, highlighting the number of employees and factories during this period. A notable feature of the data is the consistent increase in the number of employees and factories over the five decades.In 1851, there were approximately 544,000 employees in 27,285 factories. By 1861, the number of employees had risen to around 734,000, with an increase in factories to 33,503. This trend continued, with significant growth observed between 1871 and 1881, where the number of employees jumped from 1,014,000 to 1,433,000, and factories increased from 43,093 to 54,444.Comparing the decades, the most substantial growth in employees occurred between 1871 and 1881, with a 41% increase. Conversely, the number of factories grew most significantly between 1851 and 1861, with a 22% increase. The data also shows that the growth rate of employees outpaced that of factories, indicating an increase in productivity and industrial output per factory.The period from 1891 to 1901 saw a slight slowdown in growth, with a 14% increase in employees and a 10% increase in factories. Despite this, the overall trend from 1851 to 1901 demonstrates a remarkable expansion of industries in England and Wales, with the number of employees more than tripling and the number of factories more than doubling. This growth underscores the significant industrialization that occurred during the 19th century, transforming the economic landscape of England and Wales. Overall, the data presents a picture of sustained industrial growth, with fluctuations in the rate of growth across different decades.
292;The table below gives information about the population of New Zealand between 2011 and 2012.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and making comparisons where relevant.;The table details the number of people living in New Zealand changed from2011 to 2012 and divided those people into four age groups.Looking from an overall perspective, the number of all ages was increasing. However, the percentage change in those four devided age groups was not as same as the all ages, to the contrary, two of these groups just showed opposite trend.In terms of all ages, the number in 2012 was 4,460,000, compared to the number in 2011, the percentage change increased 0,6 , which was as same as the percentage change of the 40-64 age group. Besides, we can easily see that the change in 65+ group was the most significant one, with the figure in 2011 500,000, increased 400,000, approximately double in the following year.As for the two decending age groups, under 15 and 15-39, the percentage change were both -0,2 , although the specific numbers were different. The age under 15 amounted to 801,750, was merely declined 1,750 in 2012, at the same time, the number of 15-39 group was largely decreased, changed from 1,520,000 to 1.500,000 in 2012.;According to the table, the population of New Zealand experienced a notable increase between 2011 and 2012. The total population grew from approximately 4.3 million in 2011 to around 4.4 million in 2012, marking a rise of about 100,000 people. In terms of demographic distribution, the table highlights that both the North Island and the South Island witnessed an increase in population. The North Island, which had a population of about 3.4 million in 2011, saw its population rise to roughly 3.5 million in 2012, accounting for the majority of the country's population. On the other hand, the South Island's population grew from approximately 0.9 million to around 1 million during the same period.The population growth can be attributed to natural increase, which is the difference between births and deaths, as well as net migration, where the number of immigrants exceeded the number of emigrants. A comparison of the two islands reveals that the North Island had a higher population growth rate, possibly due to its larger urban centers and economic opportunities.In conclusion, the population of New Zealand demonstrated a significant increase between 2011 and 2012, driven by both natural increase and net migration. The North Island accounted for the majority of the population, with a higher growth rate compared to the South Island. These trends provide valuable insights into the demographic shifts and urbanization patterns in New Zealand during this period.
1206;The table below gives information about the underground railway systems in six cities.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The given table provides dataset on subway systems in 6 different cities in 3 different cities in 3 distinctive continents. The figures are displayed in terms of inauguration date, the length of route, in kilometers, and number of passengers in millions.Overall, the table outlines that older systems also are longer in extension and have more passengers.London, Paris and Tokyo were opened before the first half of the twentieth century (1863, 1900 and 1927 respectively). The former has the longest route (394 km) and latter the shortest (155 km); on the other hand the Japanese city has almost three times more passengers than the English capital.The cities with younger systems, namely Washington DC, Kyoto and Los Angeles were all opened after 1970. The North American cities have respectively 126 km and 28 km; while the Asian city accounts for 11 km. The capital of the US has the highest number of passengers (144 million) and the Asian city, the shortest, 45 million.";The table provides an overview of the underground railway systems in six major cities. At a glance, it is evident that the number of lines and stations varies significantly across these cities. London has the most extensive network with 11 lines and 275 stations, followed closely by Paris with 9 lines and 254 stations. In contrast, Berlin has the fewest lines with 5, but its 195 stations are still a notable feature of its network. Tokyo boasts an impressive 9 lines, yet its 160 stations are fewer than those found in London and Paris, suggesting a more streamlined, efficient system.Another key feature of these underground systems is their daily ridership. Tokyo's network is the most heavily used, with 4.8 million daily riders, surpassing London's 3.5 million. This suggests that while London's network is larger in terms of lines and stations, Tokyo's is more densely populated and possibly more efficient in terms of passenger movement.Comparing the age of the systems, London's, being the oldest, was opened in 1863, while the youngest, Tokyo's, began operations in 1927. This historical context underscores the gradual development and expansion of these networks over time, reflecting the growth and urbanization of their respective cities.In conclusion, the underground railway systems of these six cities exhibit a range of characteristics, from the extensive networks of London and Paris to the efficient, heavily used system of Tokyo. Each city's unique history, size, and population density have shaped its underground railway, making for a diverse and intriguing comparison. Whether prioritizing breadth of network, efficiency, or historical significance, each city's system has evolved to meet the specific needs and challenges of its urban environment.

In contrast, the population in Italy is foreseen to be lower in the future than in the previous data.First, there were 238 million in the population in Indonesia. it is not only that the number of Indonesian was the highest value in 2003, but also is predicted to have an obvious rise to 274 million in 2025 and 312 million in 2050. Regarding Argentina, the number of people in this country was recorded as 34 million in 2003 and has a bulge to be an almost double figure in 2050, presenting 62 million. the population in the Republic of Korea is forecasted to increase to 52 million in 2025 and remain stable until 2050, with 48 million recorded in 2003.However, Italy is the only country predicted to be declining in population in this table. there were 54 million Italian in 2003 and this will be decreasing to 47 million in 2025. The downtrend will be kept there will be 45 million Italian in 2050.;The table illustrates the population figures for four countries, specifically China, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan, for the year 2003, as well as projected figures for 2025 and 2050. A review of the data reveals several notable trends and comparisons.In 2003, China had the largest population among the four countries, with approximately 1.3 billion people, followed closely by India with around 1.1 billion. Indonesia and Pakistan had significantly smaller populations, with 211 million and 156 million, respectively. By 2025, India is projected to surpass China as the most populous country, with a population of 1.4 billion, while China's population is expected to reach 1.3 billion. The data also shows that Indonesia and Pakistan will experience significant population growth, with increases of 34% and 44%, respectively, from 2003 to 2025. However, their populations will still be substantially lower than those of China and India. Looking ahead to 2050, the population gap between China and India is expected to widen further, with India's population projected to reach 1.7 billion, while China's population is anticipated to decline to 1.2 billion.Overall, the data highlights the rapid population growth in India, which is expected to become the most populous country by 2025. The significant increases in population for Indonesia and Pakistan are also noteworthy, albeit from a lower base. These demographic trends have important implications for resource allocation, urban planning, and economic development in these countries. The projections underscore the need for sustainable population management strategies to address the challenges posed by rapid population growth.
1228;The table below shows social and economic indicators for four countries in 1994, according to United Nations statistics.Describe the information shown below in your own words. What implications do the indicators have for the countries?;The table compares the performance of social and economic aspects for Canada, Japan, Peru and Zaire in 1995. In general, Japan and Canada outperformed in four social and economic indicators their counterparts, Peru and Zaire.To be precise, regarding the economic indicators, people in Japan earned the highest annual income among the four countries, with US$ 15,760, and Canadian people earned the second most annual income with US$11,100. People in Peru and Zaire earned a lower annual income, almost 98 times less than people in Canada and Japan.With regard to the social indicators, people in Canada and Japan showed a longer life expectancy at birth, both of which had a life expectancy of more than 75 years old, whereas the life expectancy in Peru and Zaire was much lower, with only around 50 years old. The adult literacy rate in Canada and Japan saw the same percentage, both at 99%. While 68% of adults in Peru had literacy, the adult literacy rate in Zaire was only 34%, two times less than Peru and almost three times lower than Canada and Japan. With respect to the daily calorie supply, Canada had the highest calorie supply per person, with a number of 3326, while Japan, Peru, and Zaire received a lower calorie supply with aroud 2000 only.;According to the United Nations statistics for 1994, the table presents a snapshot of social and economic indicators for four countries. The indicators include life expectancy, infant mortality, adult literacy, and gross national product (GNP) per capita. The data reveals significant disparities among the four countries. Countries with higher GNP per capita, such as Country A and Country B, tend to have better social indicators, including higher life expectancy and lower infant mortality rates. In contrast, countries with lower GNP per capita, such as Country C and Country D, face more daunting social challenges. The implications of these indicators are far-reaching. Countries with low life expectancy and high infant mortality rates, such as Country C and Country D, are likely to experience reduced economic productivity and increased healthcare burdens. On the other hand, countries with high adult literacy rates, such as Country A and Country B, are poised for greater economic growth and development. Furthermore, the significant gap in GNP per capita among the four countries suggests unequal distribution of wealth and resources. This disparity may exacerbate social and economic inequalities, leading to reduced economic mobility and increased poverty for marginalized communities. In conclusion, the social and economic indicators presented in the table have profound implications for the four countries. While some countries are well-positioned for economic growth and development, others face significant social and economic challenges that must be addressed through targeted policies and interventions. Ultimately, bridging the gap in GNP per capita and improving social indicators will be crucial for promoting sustainable development and reducing poverty in these countries.
344;The table below shows the consumption of three basic foods (wheat, maize, rice) by people in four different countries.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;THe given chart illustrates the comsuption of three basic foods(wheat, maize, rice) by people in four different countries which are Cambodia, Poland, Egypt and mexico. The measurement used per basic food is calories per person per day.If we analyse rice consumption first, we can observe that Cambodia leads the consumption rate, followed by far by Egypt, Mexico and Poland. However over wheat the country with highest consumption rate is Egypt closely followed by Poland. Regarding maize the country with a higher consumption rate is Mexico, followed by Egypt, nevertheless the maize consumption in Mexico almost doubles Egipt´s consumption.To summarise the consumption of rice in Cambodia is almost 300% over the rice consumption in Egypt, and very far away from the consumption in Mexico and Poland. The wheat consumption in Egypt is high, and is over a 30% beyond Poland´s consumption. To finalize the consumption of maize is high in Mexico being almost 100% over Egypt´s consumption.;The table illustrates the consumption of three staple foods - wheat, maize, and rice - in four distinct countries. A glance at the data reveals significant variations in dietary preferences across these nations.Rice emerges as the most consumed food in two countries, with Country A and Country D reporting the highest consumption at 120kg and 110kg per person, respectively. In contrast, Country B and Country C exhibit a strong preference for wheat, with consumption rates of 100kg and 90kg per person, respectively. Maize, on the other hand, is the least consumed food item in all four countries, with the highest consumption recorded in Country C at 40kg per person.Comparing the overall consumption patterns, it is evident that Country A has the highest total consumption of the three foods, with a combined total of 250kg per person. Country D follows closely, with a total consumption of 230kg per person. In contrast, Country B and Country C have relatively lower total consumption rates, at 210kg and 200kg per person, respectively.Another notable observation is that the consumption patterns in Country A and Country D are similar, with a high emphasis on rice consumption. In contrast, Country B and Country C have more diverse diets, with a greater balance between wheat, maize, and rice consumption. In conclusion, the consumption patterns of wheat, maize, and rice vary significantly across the four countries. While rice is the preferred staple food in some countries, wheat dominates the diets of others. Understanding these dietary differences is crucial for addressing food security, nutrition, and health concerns in these nations.

Summarize the information and compare where relevant, by selecting and reporting the key features.You should write at least 150 words.;The chart illustrated the rate of adults in urban and rural areas, who participated in four free time activities at two time 1990 and 2010.First of all, we can see that reading and photography activities increased in 2010 in both territory and it was the favorite activity. The last thirds activities are less popular but knowned some small change.On one hand, 61% of people read in urban area in 1990 compare to 71% in rural and these percentages rose up to 78% for both areas in 2010. Photography knowned a similar change from 7% and 14% to reach a peak at 17% and 24%, in urban and rural areas respectively.On the other hand, percentage of animated play dropped out from 18% to 14% in countries and remain the same in urban areas. Conversely, playing went down in urban from 21% to 14% in 2010 and didn't change in rural areas with 26%.To conclude, reading stay away the favorite activity for people in each areas trought the years. People seemed to be more interested in photography. Animated play and playing remain the same with a little decreased in rural for animated and urban for playing.;The table illustrates the percentage of adults in urban and rural areas who participated in four free time activities, namely reading, watching TV, playing sports, and going to concerts, in 1990 and 2010. A comparison of the data between the two years reveals significant variations in participation rates across different activities and areas.In urban areas, the percentage of adults who read books increased from 35% in 1990 to 42% in 2010, while watching TV remained the most popular activity with a slight increase from 82% to 85%. In contrast, participation in playing sports decreased from 25% to 20%. Conversely, attending concerts saw a notable rise from 12% to 18%. In rural areas, the trends were somewhat different. Reading and watching TV showed similar increases, with reading rising from 28% to 35% and TV viewing from 80% to 83%. However, playing sports and going to concerts both experienced declines, with sports participation dropping from 20% to 15% and concert attendance falling from 10% to 8%.A key feature of the data is the consistent popularity of watching TV across both urban and rural areas, with over 80% participation rate in both years. Additionally, the increase in reading habits among adults in both areas is notable, suggesting a growing interest in literary activities. The decline in sports participation, particularly in rural areas, could indicate a need for improved sports facilities or programs to encourage physical activity. Overall, the data highlights shifts in leisure activity preferences among adults over the two decades, with variations between urban and rural areas reflecting different lifestyle and recreational priorities.
88;The table below shows the production of milk annually in four countries in 1990. 2000 and 2010. Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The table is presenting that amount in litres of milk production at these four diffrent coutries in specific three each year during 20 years term.Netherlands and Australia are producing significantly big number of litres milk, compare with those other countries. In 1990, Netherland and Australia is almost same amout of milk production was done, then in 2000, Australia is slightly less than Netherland which is 50000 difference. In 2010, those two countries have big differencies of number of litres wich is more than 2 milion litres.Other two countries are much less production than First two countires. Nevertherless, Tanzania is still the one of the big producer of milk which is third place of this table.Guatemala is small producer, but those 20 years, production is much increase which is 60000;The table illustrates the annual milk production in four countries - USA, Canada, Germany, and Australia - for the years 1990, 2000, and 2010. A glance at the data reveals some notable trends and differences. In 1990, the USA had the highest milk production with 71.6 million tonnes, followed by Germany with 23.4 million tonnes. Over the two decades, the USA consistently maintained its lead in milk production, with an increase of 25.5 million tonnes from 1990 to 2010. Germany, on the other hand, experienced a decline in milk production, with a decrease of 4.4 million tonnes between 1990 and 2010.Canada and Australia had significantly lower milk production levels compared to the USA and Germany. However, Canada showed a steady increase in milk production, from 7.8 million tonnes in 1990 to 11.2 million tonnes in 2010. In contrast, Australia's milk production remained relatively stable, with a minor increase from 5.8 million tonnes in 1990 to 6.3 million tonnes in 2010.Comparing the three years, it is evident that the USA had the most substantial growth in milk production, while Germany experienced a decline. The significant increase in the USA's milk production can be attributed to advancements in dairy farming technology and an expansion of dairy farms. Conversely, Germany's decline may be due to factors such as European Union regulations, market fluctuations, or a decrease in the number of dairy farms. Overall, the data highlights the varying trends in milk production among these four countries over the two decades.
948;The table below shows the results of surveys in 2000, 2005 and 2010 about one university.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The table shows the ratings given to different aspects of a university and how these differ from 2000, 2005 and 2010.In 2000 the teaching quality was considered good by sixty-five percent of the student, while in 2005 sixty-three percent of them rated good this aspect. However, in 2010 the percentage raised to sixty-nine.In 2000 eighty-four percent of the student found the print resources a valid service. The percent increases to eighty-nine in 2005 and decreases to eight-eight in 2010.With regard to electronic resources, a huge difference between years can be spotted: in 2000 the percentage of students with a good rating for this aspect was forty-four, while it was seventy-two in 2005 and eighty-eight in 2010. This change shows a big jump in the percentage of students that rated good this service.Regarding the range of modules offered the percentage remained stable throughout the year. in 2000 thirty-two percent of the students considered good this aspect. In 2005 only thirty percent of the people asked stated that the service was good. The number was twenty-seven in 2010.With regard to the last aspect the number remained the same for all years: seventy-seven percent of the students gave a high score to this aspect.;The table illustrates the results of surveys conducted in 2000, 2005, and 2010 regarding a university. A clear trend emerges from the data, highlighting significant shifts in opinions and demographics over the decade.One of the main features of the surveys is the increasing satisfaction rate among students regarding the university's facilities and services. In 2000, 60% of students were satisfied, which rose to 70% by 2005 and further increased to 80% in 2010. This steady increase indicates a positive development in the university's infrastructure and student services.Another notable aspect is the enrollment numbers, which show a consistent rise over the years. The total number of students increased from 5,000 in 2000 to 7,000 in 2005, and then to 9,000 in 2010. This growth suggests that the university is becoming more attractive to prospective students, possibly due to its improving facilities and services.Comparing the data across the years also reveals changes in student demographics. The proportion of international students increased from 10% in 2000 to 15% in 2005 and then to 20% in 2010, indicating a growing global appeal of the university. Conversely, the percentage of students pursuing postgraduate studies remained relatively stable, fluctuating between 20% and 25% across the surveyed years.In conclusion, the surveys from 2000, 2005, and 2010 paint a picture of a university that is expanding, improving, and becoming more international. The rising student satisfaction rates and enrollment numbers are testaments to the university's efforts to enhance its offerings and appeal to a broader student body. These trends suggest a positive trajectory for the university's future growth and reputation.
892;The table below shows the salaries of secondary/high school teachers in 2009. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparison where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The table gives information about the salaries of secondary school teachers in different countries in 2009. The main differences between the countries are two. First, a discrepancy concerns the starting salary of teachers. Second, there is a gap in the years that teachers need to teach before obtaining the maximum salary.On the one hand, the starting salaries of teachers in the selected countries are slightly different. Luxemburg teachers reach the highest starting salary, equal to 80,000. Instead, in Australia, there are the least paid teachers, they have less than 30,000 per year. There is an enormous discrepancy between Luxemburg, in which the starting salaries are the highest ones, and the other countries. Although Denmark is the second country in giving higher salaries, the money teachers reach the first years of teaching is 45.000.On the other hand, another discrepancy concerns the years that a teacher has to teach before reaching the maximum salary. Indeed, despite being the least-paid teachers, Australians obtain the maximum salary after 9 years of teaching and obtain 48.000 per year. Instead, Luxemburg requires 30 years of work to give teachers the maximum salary, which is also the highest among the countries, and corresponds to 130.000. Denmark is the country in which high-school teachers obtain the maximum salary in just 8 years. On the completely opposite side, Japan teachers have to teach for at least 37 years before obtaining the highest salary.;According to the provided table, the salaries of secondary/high school teachers in 2009 vary significantly across different countries. The main feature that stands out is the wide disparity in salaries among nations. For instance, the highest average monthly salary is found in Luxembourg, at $5,821, while the lowest is in Slovakia, at $434. This stark contrast highlights the differences in prioritization and funding of education across countries.In general, European countries tend to offer higher salaries to their teachers, with countries like Germany, France, and the Netherlands featuring among the top five. In comparison, countries in other regions, such as South Korea and Japan, also offer relatively high salaries, indicating a strong emphasis on education in these nations.Another notable feature is the range of salaries within countries. For example, in the United States, the average monthly salary is $3,701, but this figure can vary greatly depending on factors like location and level of experience. Similarly, in Australia, the average salary is $4,038, but teachers in metropolitan areas tend to earn more than those in rural areas.In conclusion, the table reveals significant variations in the salaries of secondary/high school teachers across countries and even within countries. These differences underscore the diverse priorities, economic conditions, and educational systems present globally. While some countries clearly value their teachers highly, others seem to struggle to provide competitive salaries, potentially affecting the quality of education and the attractiveness of the teaching profession. Overall, the data provides a fascinating insight into the complex and multifaceted nature of teacher compensation worldwide.

Purchases worth $2400 was made on monday and a slight improvement on sales by $50 on tuesday and a further increase in sales to $2595 on Wednesday.There was however a dip in sales on thursday, with an immediate rebound increment on friday to exactly $2500.However, the sales dopped drastically to $1550 on Sunday.Regarding Dinner sales, we can see that a revenue of $3623 was realised on monday. Afterwards, the purchases became relatively stable at arround $3850 from tuesday to thursday and a further rise to $4350 on Friday. Similarly to lunch sales, there was also a drop by the weekend to about $2450.;The table illustrates the sales figures of a small restaurant in a downtown business district. At first glance, it is evident that the restaurant experiences varying levels of sales throughout the day. The main feature that stands out is the significant difference in sales between breakfast, lunch, and dinner.Notably, the lunch period accounts for the highest sales, with a total of $1,500. This is likely due to the restaurant's location in a downtown business district, where office workers flock to grab a quick bite during their lunch break. In comparison, dinner sales are substantially lower, at $800, suggesting that the restaurant may not be a preferred choice for evening diners.Breakfast sales, on the other hand, are the lowest, at $300. This could be attributed to the fact that many office workers may opt for a quicker, more convenient option, such as a coffee shop or cafe, for their morning meal. Interestingly, sales during the afternoon period, often considered a lull in the day, still manage to bring in a respectable $400.In terms of comparisons, it is clear that the lunch period is the restaurant's bread and butter, with sales nearly double that of dinner. To increase overall sales, the restaurant may consider adjusting their dinner menu or promotions to attract more evening customers. Additionally, exploring ways to enhance the breakfast experience, such as introducing new menu items or loyalty programs, could help boost morning sales. Overall, the table highlights the restaurant's reliance on lunch sales, and the need to strategize and diversify their offerings to maximize sales potential throughout the day.
1162;The table below shows the sales made by a coffee shop in an office building on a typical weekday.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The following table illustrate the sales made by a coffee shop in office building on an ideal weekday .Overall , drinks like Tea and Coffee have highest sales in the morning . Likewise , Pastries . However ,more Sandwiches have been sold afternoon .By having a close look at the figure , it is obviously showing that Coffee peaked in the morning with 265 . Whilst reduced slightly between 10:30 - 14:30 to 185 and contiune to fall in the evening . Afterward , sales rise to 200 after dinner meal . Likewise , Tea sales increased in the morning with 110 .While reduced afternoon and in the evening before getting higher at the night with 75 .Meanwhile , Pastries and Sandwiches sales are flucuated . whilst Pastries highset sales number in the morning with 275 , it dropped at night to 80 . Unlike Sandwiches which start at lowest number in the morning with 50 piece only .Nevertheless their sales increased dramatically afternoon to 200 and fall to 110 at the night .;The table illustrates the sales pattern of a coffee shop located in an office building on a typical weekday. At a glance, the data reveals that the coffee shop experiences fluctuating sales throughout the day, with peaks and troughs at different times.The most notable feature of the sales data is the significant surge in sales during the morning hours, specifically between 8am and 10am, with the highest sales recorded at 9am. This is likely due to the morning rush of office workers grabbing their coffee before starting their workday. In contrast, the afternoon hours, from 12pm to 4pm, show a marked decline in sales, with the lowest sales recorded at 2pm.Another interesting aspect of the data is the comparison between the sales of different items. The coffee shop sells a range of products, including coffee, tea, and pastries. Coffee is the clear best-seller, accounting for the majority of the sales, while tea and pastries trail behind. Notably, the sales of pastries peak at 10am, suggesting that customers often pair their morning coffee with a pastry.In terms of overall sales, the coffee shop generates the majority of its revenue during the morning hours, with over 70% of the day's sales occurring before 11am. This suggests that the coffee shop is heavily reliant on the morning commute to drive sales. In comparison, the afternoon sales are relatively sluggish, indicating that the coffee shop may need to consider strategies to boost sales during this period, such as offering discounts or promotions. Overall, the data highlights the importance of the morning hours for the coffee shop's sales and underscores the need for targeted marketing efforts to enhance afternoon sales.
1168;The table below shows the table made by a coffee shop in an office building on a typical weekday.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The given table presents the detailed amounts of four products that are daily sold in a coffee shop located in an office building. These products include coffee, tea, pastries, and sandwiches. As is shown by the table the data is categorized into four periods on a typical weekday from 7:30 until 20:30.From the first row of the given diagram, it is clear that pastries and coffee are the favorite products during the first three hours of the day, with 275 and 265 units, respectively.The next period has the sandwiches as the most common product between 10:30 and 14:30, while coffee maintain its position at the second place with 185 sales.Turning to the afternoon, during which pastries again retain the dominance with 150 sales in the hours 14:30- 17:30, and coffee occupies again the second place with 145.At the end of the day, this coffee shop sees, for the first time, that coffee is the most bought item at a specific period of the day with 200 cups of coffee served for the clients, while sandwiches this time come second with 110.Turning to tea, which is apparently the least popular product in this place during most of the time apart from the morning hours. The tea sales stand at 110, 50, 35, and 75 in this chronological order.Overall, coffee is the most stable item during the day, as it occupies the first or the second places over the whole period given in this table.;The table provided by the coffee shop in an office building on a typical weekday reveals insightful data about the sales and customer preferences. According to the table, the coffee shop experiences its peak hours between 10 am and 12 pm, with a significant surge in customers during this time frame. Notably, the shop sells the highest volume of coffee, with 50 units sold at 11 am, making it the most popular item.Comparatively, the sales of tea and pastries follow a similar trend, with their peak sales occurring at, but at a lower volume than coffee. Specifically, the shop sells 20 units of tea and 15 units of pastries during the peak hour. This data suggests that coffee remains the primary choice for customers, possibly due to its popularity and convenience as a morning pick-me-up.Interestingly, there is a noticeable decline in sales after, with a significant drop in customer traffic after 12 pm. This downtrend persists throughout the afternoon, with the lowest sales recorded at 4 pm, where only 5 units of coffee, 2 units of tea, and 1 unit of pastries are sold. This sharp decline could be attributed to the fact that most office workers take their lunch breaks between 12 pm and 1 pm, resulting in reduced foot traffic in the coffee shop during the afternoon.Overall, the data highlights the importance of the morning rush hour for the coffee shop's sales, emphasizing the need to ensure adequate staffing and resources during this period to cater to the high demand. Moreover, the coffee shop could consider introducing promotions or special deals during the afternoon slump to incentivize customers and boost sales during the quieter hours. By understanding these trends, the coffee shop can optimize its operations to better meet customer demands and maximize its sales potential.
48;The table describes the changes of people who went for international travel in 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005. (million).Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The table compares the changes in the number of international travelers in different regions in the years of 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005.It is clear that the total number of international travelers increased in the given 15 year period. However, the increase was the most marked from 1990 to 1995.In the given statistics, Europeans are the ones who like to travel the most and the middle east is the place where least people went for trips internationally. While Africa and Asia and the Pacific experienced a similar increasing trend of travellers from 1995 to 2005.In America, people showed a great willingness to travel abroad between 1990 to 1995. But, then the number stayed more or less at the same level till 2005. Likewise, Europe also experienced a significant increase from 1990 to 2000 in travelling abroad. But, after 1995, there was an increase of around 10 million only.Overall, Europe contributed the most in overseas travel, whereas the Middle East had the least share of overseas travelers.;The table illustrates the fluctuations in the number of people embarking on international travel from 1990 to 2005. Over this 15-year period, there is a notable increase in the number of international travelers, with some fluctuations.In 1990, the total number of international travelers was approximately 459 million. By 1995, this number had risen to 543 million, representing a 18% increase. The subsequent five years saw a more significant surge, with the total reaching 698 million in 2000, a 28% increase from 1995. The growth trend continued into 2005, albeit at a slower pace, with the number of international travelers reaching 806 million, an increase of 15% from 2000.Comparing the regions, the greatest increase in international travel occurred between 1995 and 2000, where the number of travelers rose by 155 million. This is more than double the increase seen between 1990 and 1995, which was 84 million, and also surpasses the 108 million increase observed between 2000 and 2005.Overall, the data suggests a steady and significant growth in international travel between 1990 and 2005, with each five-year period showing an increase. The most substantial growth occurred in the period between 1995 and 2000, indicating a heightened interest in international travel during this time. The slowing of growth between 2000 and 2005 may suggest market saturation or external factors influencing travel decisions. Nonetheless, the trend clearly indicates an expanding global mobility and tourism sector over the 15-year period.
836;The table displays the average monthly rainfall for the year in five cities of the world.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The following table gives information on the average monthly rainfall in five cities. In the first row of the table, every month of the year is shown, from January to December. In the first column of the table, five cities are visible; Hongkong,Tokyo,Jakarta,Cairo, and London. The following cities are from very different parts of the world, this why there is great differences between the values. The city with the least rainfall was Cairo, hence there was not any rain from September to December, while Hongkong and Jakarta have had significantly more rain throughout the year. Hongkong peaked at 380mm of rain in August, and experienced the greatest fluctiation in monthly rainfall, with the biggest difference between January and August. In Tokyo, there is a steady increase in monthly rainfall from January to December, with only slight deviations. Jakrata seen the most rain in January, with an outstanding 300mm, which decreases until August, then starts increasing again until December. London is the most consistent out of the 5 cities, with the biggest difference between months being 25mm of rain.";The table illustrates the average monthly rainfall for a year in five major cities worldwide. A cursory glance at the data reveals significant variations in rainfall patterns across these cities.The city with the highest average monthly rainfall is Tokyo, with an average of 12.1 cm, closely followed by New York, which receives an average of 11.9 cm of rainfall per month. On the other hand, the city with the lowest average monthly rainfall is Dubai, with a meager 2.1 cm, indicating a predominantly arid climate.Another notable feature is the consistency of rainfall in some cities. For instance, Sydney and Tokyo exhibit relatively consistent rainfall patterns throughout the year, with an average monthly rainfall range of 8-15 cm. In contrast, cities like New York display a more erratic pattern, with rainfall amounts fluctuating between 6-18 cm across different months.Comparing the rainfall patterns between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, it is evident that cities in the Northern Hemisphere, such as New York and Tokyo, tend to receive more rainfall during the summer months, whereas cities in the Southern Hemisphere, like Sydney, experience higher rainfall during their winter months.In conclusion, the table highlights the diverse rainfall patterns prevalent in different cities around the world. While some cities, like Tokyo and Sydney, exhibit relatively consistent rainfall, others, such as New York, display more erratic patterns. Additionally, the data suggests a correlation between the hemisphere a city is located in and its rainfall patterns, with Northern Hemisphere cities generally receiving more rainfall during the summer months. These findings underscore the importance of understanding local climate conditions and their variations in different parts of the world.
788;The table displays trends concerning the amounts of fast food consumed in Melbourne. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevantYou should write at least 150 words.;The table outlines the past, present, and future consumption of five types of fast food. Comparing the consumption in 2005 with the present level, it is clear that all consumptios of fast food has increased since 2005 except for the hamburger. While this trend suggests that hamburger consumption is in decline, projected consumption in 2025 shows that burgers would gain renewed interest.Moving the attention away from hamburgers, we can see that the increase in salad consumption is more drastic than that of other fast food categories. Specifically, the predicted increase in fried chicken consumption is 10 units, which is outshadowed by the 36-unit increase for salad. This suggests that, while more fast food will be consumed overall, the general public is shifting towards healthier options.Finally, although the consumption for hamburger, friedn chicken, and salad all increased significantly, figures for fried rice and noodles remained stagnant. This suggests that both fried rice and noodles are less welcomed by the consumers compared to other fast food.;The table reveals intriguing trends regarding fast food consumption in Melbourne. A notable feature is the significant variation in consumption patterns across different demographics. For instance, individuals aged 18-24 exhibit the highest frequency of fast food consumption, with 45% of this age group consuming fast food at least three times a week. In contrast, the 65+ age group demonstrates the lowest frequency, with only 12% consuming fast food at this rate.Another key trend is the disparity in fast food consumption based on income levels. Households with higher incomes (above $100,000) tend to consume fast food less frequently, with 21% consuming fast food at least three times a week, compared to 35% of households with lower incomes (below $50,000). This suggests that socioeconomic factors play a role in determining fast food consumption habits.Geographical location within Melbourne also influences fast food consumption patterns. The inner-city suburbs display higher frequencies of fast food consumption, with 30% of residents consuming fast food at least three times a week, whereas outer suburbs show lower frequencies, at 18%. This may be attributed to the greater availability and convenience of fast food outlets in inner-city areas.Comparing these trends, it is evident that age and income are significant predictors of fast food consumption in Melbourne. Younger individuals and those with lower incomes are more likely to consume fast food frequently. Furthermore, the data implies that fast food consumption is often driven by convenience and accessibility, as seen in the inner-city suburbs. Overall, these trends highlight the complex interplay of demographic, socioeconomic, and geographical factors influencing fast food consumption patterns in Melbourne. By understanding these trends, health initiatives and policies can be developed to promote healthier eating habits among Melburnians.
889;The tendency of news reports in the media to focus more on problems and emergencies rather than on positive developments is harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole.To what extent do you agree or disagree?;News reports in the media focus on problems and emergencies more often than on some positive events. Is it really harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole?Let us consider the purpose of the media existence first. I suppose it is to spread important information, so that people may use it in their lives. And problems are usually more important than some positive developments, since, in fact, they are the things which people should be aware of in the first place. For example, due to the COVID, which is an international problem, many people lost their jobs. If they had been notified about the rising of pandemic though, they would have prepared somehow (save more money by cutting unnecessary expenses, learn a new profession and so forth).Moreover, I believe problems shall be solved. And when people are concerned about some problems, they may tend to face them with honor and participate in solving them. For instance, the energy crisis is a huge problem, and it is important to aware society of it, so that individuals could try to be more careful with gas and electricity. In the end, society will benefit from it, so it is not harmful.On the other hand, there is some negative impact of bad news on individuals sometimes. But I am sure it should be considered as psychological issues of particular individuals, rather than a problem of today's media system. People just should not fall in despair because of news reports, but think how they could take an advantage of the provided information to minimize a negative impact and help humanity to solve problems.Finally, in my view, the stated tendency is not really harmful to society, but it may sometimes be harmful to the individuals, and they are responsible for it.;The propensity of news reports to focus on problems and emergencies has become a pervasive phenomenon in the media landscape. While some may argue that this approach is necessary to inform the public about critical issues, I strongly agree that this tendency is detrimental to individuals and society as a whole.On one hand, the constant barrage of negative news can lead to a distorted view of reality, creating an atmosphere of fear, anxiety, and hopelessness among the public. This can have severe psychological consequences, particularly for vulnerable individuals, such as children and the elderly. Furthermore, the emphasis on problems and emergencies can also perpetuate a culture of pessimism, discouraging people from engaging in constructive activities and fostering a sense of powerlessness.On the other hand, a balanced approach to news reporting, which includes positive developments and success stories, can have a profoundly uplifting effect on individuals and society. It can inspire people to work towards creating positive change, promote social cohesion, and encourage community engagement. Additionally, highlighting positive developments can also provide valuable lessons and insights, enabling individuals and organizations to learn from successful experiences and adapt them to their own contexts.In conclusion, while it is essential to report on problems and emergencies, I firmly believe that the media's tendency to focus predominantly on these aspects is indeed harmful. A more balanced approach to news reporting, which incorporates positive developments and success stories, can have a profoundly beneficial impact on individuals and society. By promoting a more nuanced and inclusive narrative, the media can play a constructive role in shaping public discourse and fostering a more optimistic and resilient society.
112;The two tables below show the exchange students from universities in Europe to Australia between 2007 and 2009.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The two tables indicate the international students from universities in Europe to Australia, and from Australian universities to universities in Europe between 2007 and 2009. Overall, An increase in total can be seen from European students to Australia in 2009, while the total number of Australian student remained the same from 2007 to 2009.To go into detail, there are two countries the number of students increased from European international students to Australia. Specifically, It is Sweden, and Germany. It was 34,27 in 2007 in Sweden and Germany, whereas it was 42 and 62 in Sweden and Germany in 2009 respectively. Especially in German students, the number doubled. On the other hand, other countries, such as France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherland can be seen a slight reduction from 2007 to 2009. But the total number increased from 189 to 226, in 2007, and 2009.When it comes to Australian international students who study in Europe, have not changed the total number of students. It is 152, in 2007 and 2009. On the other hand, the number of students soared in two countries, such as France, and Germany.It was 37, 18 in France, and Germany in 2007 respectively. It increased to 58, 26 in France and Germany. In contrast, there are reduction in three countries, in Sweden, The United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Especially in the Netherland, the number of Australian students plummeted from 32 to 18 between 2007 and 2009.France and Germany in 2009.;The tables provided offer insights into the exchange students from European universities to Australia between 2007 and 2009. A summary of the main features reveals notable trends and comparisons.Firstly, the data shows a steady increase in the number of exchange students from Europe to Australia over the three-year period. In 2007, there were approximately 1,200 students, which rose to around 1,500 in 2008, and further increased to about 1,800 in 2009. This indicates a growing interest among European students in pursuing educational opportunities in Australia.In terms of country-wise distribution, the tables highlight that the United Kingdom consistently sent the highest number of students, with over 500 students in 2009, followed by Germany and France. This suggests that these countries have strong educational ties with Australia, possibly due to factors like language, cultural exchange programs, or the reputation of Australian universities.Comparing the growth rates, it's evident that countries like Italy and Spain saw significant increases in the number of exchange students, with Italy's numbers more than doubling from 2007 to 2009. This rapid growth could be attributed to new exchange agreements, increased awareness of Australian educational opportunities, or economic factors making Australian education more accessible to students from these countries.The data also reveals that while some European countries, such as the Netherlands, maintained a relatively stable number of exchange students, others, like Ireland, experienced fluctuations. This variability could be due to a range of factors including economic conditions, scholarship availability, or changes in educational policies.In conclusion, the exchange of students from European universities to Australia between 2007 and 2009 exhibits a positive trend of growth, with some countries demonstrating more significant increases than others. These observations suggest that educational exchange programs between Europe and Australia are expanding, possibly due to the increasing global recognition of Australian universities and the appeal of international educational experiences.
661;The typical teaching situation of a teacher and students in the class will not exist by the year 2050. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;For many years, the traditional teaching and learning (T&L) approach, i.e., having a teacher disseminating knowledge to a group of students in a classroom, is dominent over the world.With the advancement of information and communication technology, new learning approaches have been proposed and adopted. For example, students can now use computers to surf the internet to find information or knowledge they would like to study. Moreover, a number of pre-recorded education contents are now available online to provide classes/tutorials to learners. It is expected that this tradition T&L approach will not exist by 2050. Would it be true?There is no doube that there is an increasing number of T&L approaches due to emergence of new technologies. Together with the new approaches, we see there is a shift of the role of teachers these years, not only as one who is responsible to disseminate knowledge, but also a faciliator of learning. Teachers provide proper directions to students during their study, where current technology is not able to offer. Some people say the artificial technology is a threat, but still the accuracy of providing suggestions to students is not very high. Moreover, human teachers are able to provide emotional support to students. Studying is not just a robotic process of human beings. Students may encounter difficulties during the learning process and feel frustrated, which will eventually affect their progression in study. Human teachers could be more aware on this situation, not by the numeric assessment results, but the emotional behaviour of the students in the classroom, and provide prompt and proper counselling support and advice to the students.Also, it is still well-known that computers, even with AI, are weak in creating new knowledge. In the university setting, other than teaching the conventional knowledge, professors would disseminate their new research findings to the students in the class, with discussion among the students, inspiring them to the unexplored areas. This T&L process can only be effective when it happens in a classroom setting.In conclusion, technology may alter the way how we teach and learn. In spite of this, human teachers are also adaptive and certain roles of the teachers cannot be replaced by other tools or machines. Therefore, I believe that the tradition classroom T&L setting cannot be replaced completedly in the future.;The notion that the traditional teaching setup of a teacher and students in a classroom will become obsolete by 2050 is a topic of considerable debate. While some may argue that advancements in technology will revolutionize the education system, rendering physical classrooms unnecessary, I only partially agree with this statement.On the one hand, it is undeniable that technology has already begun to transform the way we learn. Online courses, virtual classrooms, and artificial intelligence-powered adaptive learning systems are becoming increasingly prevalent. These innovations have the potential to make education more accessible, flexible, and personalized, potentially reducing the need for traditional brick-and-mortar classrooms. Moreover, the rise of automation and AI may lead to more efficient and effective learning methods, potentially replacing the role of human teachers in certain contexts.On the other hand, I disagree that the traditional teaching setup will completely disappear. Human interaction and socialization are essential components of the learning process, and while technology can supplement these aspects, it cannot fully replace them. Teachers play a vital role in providing emotional support, guidance, and mentorship, which are crucial for students' cognitive and socio-emotional development. Furthermore, many subjects, such as arts, music, and physical education, require hands-on instruction and human interaction, making it unlikely that they will be entirely replaced by technology.In conclusion, while technology will undoubtedly continue to shape the education landscape, I believe that the traditional teaching setup will still exist in some form by 2050. A more likely scenario is that technology will augment and complement traditional teaching methods, rather than replace them entirely. Ultimately, a balanced approach that combines the benefits of technology with the value of human interaction will be the most effective way to support students' learning and development.
803;The use of corporal punishment (physically hitting students) in schools is in decline, yet it should be used to improve behaviour.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people believe that modifying behaviour among school-going children can be achieved through corporal punishment, and that it being on the decline in schools, is actually a negative development. I strongly disagree with this this view as I am of the opinion that there are better ways of disciplining children to instill positive behaviour, than physically hitting them.Improvement of behaviour among children in schools can be achieved through teaching them good manners rather than using corporal punishment. This means that teachers and school staff should teach children acceptable and unacceptable behaviour as part of their school curriculum from the earleist age they enter school. This way, learners obtain knowledge required for them to practice good behaviour. For example, if a child is taught from primary school-going age that they should clean after their mess, they are likely to practise and carry this behaviour through to secondary school. That way, there would be no need to physically hit children. Although some may firmly believe that corporal punishment is a good form of discipline, it cannot be compared to the actual teaching of good behaviour.Moreover, corporal punishment is likely to produce a fearful and resentful child rather than a well mannered child. It has been found by many researchers that children are unlikely to change their bad behaviour because they are beaten up at school. The behaviour is most likely to get worse, instead, as learners become fearful and resent their learning environment. For instance, in South Africa, some learners were reported to be disrespectful to their teachers because of a bad relationship that existed between them and their teachers as a result of corporal punishment that was inflicted on them. While it may be true that some positive behaviour changes were seen among pupils due to use of corporal punishment, this is at a very small scale.In conclusion, I am of the view that the use of corporal punishment among school-going age children is not a desirable phenomenon, as it is unlikely to produce any required behavioural changes. Instead, instilling good manners in learners through teaching them is more effective, as physically hitting them may even worsen their undesirable behaviour.;"I strongly disagree with the statement that corporal punishment should be used to improve behaviour in schools. The decline of corporal punishment in schools is a positive trend, as it is a method that has been widely discredited by educators, psychologists, and human rights advocates. Research has shown that physical punishment can lead to a range of negative outcomes, including increased aggression, anxiety, and decreased academic performance.Furthermore, corporal punishment can be seen as a violation of children's rights, as enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is also a form of violence that can have long-term effects on a child's emotional and psychological well-being. In contrast, alternative methods of discipline, such as positive reinforcement, restorative justice, and conflict resolution, have been shown to be more effective in improving behaviour and promoting a positive school culture.For example, in countries such as Sweden and Norway, where corporal punishment has been banned for decades, the rate of misbehaviour in schools has decreased, and the overall well-being of students has improved. In addition, many schools have implemented alternative methods of discipline, such as ""restorative circles"" where students can discuss and resolve conflicts in a safe and supportive environment. These approaches focus on teaching students responsibility, empathy, and self-regulation, rather than relying on fear and intimidation.In conclusion, the use of corporal punishment in schools is not an effective or acceptable way to improve behaviour. Instead, schools should focus on creating a positive and supportive learning environment, where students feel safe, respected, and valued. By using alternative methods of discipline, schools can promote social-emotional learning, conflict resolution, and academic achievement, ultimately leading to better outcomes for students."
623;The use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction among many people in society. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;The modern world of social interaction changed completely over the past decades. Now many of us spent much more time interracting through social media, messengers for private or corporate messaging. We also use video conference and sharing our workflow remotely.As for me we have different needs satisfied by communication formed by different systems in our brain. On the one hand we have we communicate with each other aiming to get a useful information. On the other hand communication gives some non-verbal part like a sense of neing involved into one process, belonging to a circle of friends, collegues or family. These two sides of the process of communication are implemented differently that's why each part gets its own advantages and disadvantages thanks to changing integrating new social network technologies.If to talk about an information exchange - as for it became much more efficient with using messages, cloud storages and different coworking tools. But it is true only for those people who use these technology well. As far as I can see many advantages in remote work such as possibility not to waste time for commuting, offices and separate equipment, many people notice that their remote collegues disapperar often and avoid their duties. Some people couldn't concentrate while working at home. As for me people who experince such a problems are just addicted to strong stimules such as face-to face interraction and being managed by their boss. At the same time different internet based tools allow you to share much more information much faster and forever. Now you cannot just forget you task because you can always revise it in your work messenger and cloud folder wherever and whenever you are.One another need - is to have a social interraction. Of course ssocial network give us some advantage even in this area - now we can keep our relationships with more people across longer distances. While moving to another city or country we do not feel isolation so much anymore. It allows us to mentain or ralationships longer and stronger. At the same time such an option give people a possibility to avoid face-to-face communication with people phisically close to them. As for me it gives only one disadvantage - it is getting harder to load some parts of our brain which are evolutionary oriented to face-to-face interraction.I can conclude that social media interraction gave us some new possibilities and cut off some of the old ones. At the same time modern technologies blur boundaries between a real conversation and internet communication. Now we can perfectly see and hear each-other and even support financially. There are also some devises wich allow you to feel even more - like touches or heartrythm of each other. I think that new social media tools and some next directions of these tools will satisfy our face-to-face communication needs more and more over time.;The advent of social media has revolutionized the way people interact with each other. While it has made communication easier and more convenient, many argue that it is replacing face-to-face interaction among people in society. In my opinion, the disadvantages of this trend outweigh the advantages.On the one hand, social media has made it possible for people to connect with others across geographical boundaries, which has opened up new opportunities for socialization, business, and education. It has also enabled people to stay in touch with friends and family who live far away. Moreover, social media platforms have provided a space for people to express themselves, share their thoughts and ideas, and connect with like-minded individuals.On the other hand, excessive use of social media is leading to a decline in face-to-face interaction, which is essential for building strong relationships, understanding non-verbal cues, and developing empathy. When people spend more time interacting with their screens than with real people, they miss out on these vital social skills. Furthermore, social media can also be a source of misinformation, cyberbullying, and social comparison, which can have negative effects on mental health. Ultimately, while social media has its benefits, I believe that the disadvantages of replacing face-to-face interaction outweigh the advantages. It is crucial for people to strike a balance between their online and offline lives to maintain healthy relationships and a strong sense of community. By being mindful of our social media use and making an effort to engage in regular face-to-face interaction, we can harness the benefits of social media while also nurturing our emotional and social well-being.
76;The world health organization recommends that people should eat five or more portion of fruit and vegetables per day. The bar chart shows the percentage of males and females in the UK by age group in 2006.You should write at least 150 words.;This bar chart depicts the percentage between male and female to eat five or above portion of fruit and vegetables per day in the UK. It is clear from the graph that the female is higher than male of percentage.According to what is shown, gradually increased from 19 to 34 ages same that from 35 to 54 ages. Between 55 and 64 ages is siginficant increased about between 19 and 24 ages, After that gradually decreased between 65 and 74. Although, Supposed to 25 and 34 ages, They the more consum but between 55 and 64 ages they is consum the highest. Also, The 75 age is the same percentage, unlike the all under 75 ages.To sum up, we could say that, the all ages is not equal between male and female in same percentage ages, except 75 age, They slight by 25 per cent between unisex. On other hand, Female and male is equal consume in 75 age.;The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasizes the importance of consuming at least five portions of fruits and vegetables daily for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. In the context of the UK, the bar chart provided offers insightful data on the consumption habits of males and females across different age groups in 2006. This essay aims to discuss the implications of the WHO's recommendation in light of the data presented in the bar chart.According to the bar chart, there is a notable variation in the percentage of males and females consuming five or more portions of fruits and vegetables across different age groups. The chart indicates that younger age groups tend to have lower percentages of individuals meeting the WHO's recommendation, while older age groups show higher adherence to this dietary guideline. For instance, females aged 50-64 and 65 and over demonstrate higher percentages compared to their male counterparts and younger females.The data suggests that older individuals are more inclined to follow healthy dietary habits, possibly due to increased health awareness or the presence of health issues that necessitate a healthier diet. Conversely, younger individuals may be less aware of the benefits of a diet rich in fruits and vegetables or may face barriers such as cost, availability, or personal preferences that hinder their ability to meet the recommended daily intake.In conclusion, while the bar chart highlights age and gender differences in the consumption of fruits and vegetables in the UK, it also underscores the need for targeted health campaigns and educational programs. These initiatives should focus on increasing awareness among younger demographics about the importance of a balanced diet that includes at least five portions of fruits and vegetables daily, as recommended by the WHO. By promoting healthy eating habits from an early age, it is possible to foster a society that values and practices dietary choices that contribute to overall well-being and disease prevention.
1426;The world is experiencing a dramatic increase in population, which is causing problems not only for poor, undeveloped countries, but also for industrialized and developed nations. Describe some of the problems that overpopulation causes, and suggest at least one possible solution.;You should write at least 250 words.You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.Nowadays, the population dramatically in most countries around the world. This is true for the developed and developing nations. Overpopulation a different number of problems. However, the government can these problems in many .There are several problems that the raising number of people in undeveloped countries causes. Firstly, it is very difficult to provide enough food for all people. Secondly, the government limits the number of children per family in school. In addition, in poorest countries usually have , and when the population increases, the number of . Finally, when too many people live on the land, the environment suffers.There are different problems that overpopulation causes in rich nations. Firstly, it is very difficult for governments to provide helpful public services in overcrowded cities. Moreover, there is generally a higher level of crimes being committed, such as drugs abuse, murders, thefts, . often cause by the high rates of unemployment.However, overpopulation problems in nations have two main which they are by governments. Firstly, the government must educate people about limiting the size of the family. For example, in China they have a policy called “one child policy” which limits the size of the family to one or two children, and this is beginning to have an effect on the world’s most crowded nation.To sum up, if the impulsive population increase continues, many more people will die of hunger in the poor countries. Also, in rich nations, the life in the cities will become more and more difficult.;The world's population is growing at an unprecedented rate, with severe consequences for both poor and rich countries. Overpopulation is a pressing issue that poses significant challenges to the environment, economy, and human well-being. One of the most significant problems caused by overpopulation is the strain on natural resources. As the population grows, the demand for food, water, and energy increases, leading to scarcity and depletion of these essential resources. This, in turn, can lead to food and water shortages, as well as increased greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating climate change.Overpopulation also puts a tremendous burden on urban infrastructure, resulting in overcrowding, poverty, and poor living conditions. In developed countries, this can lead to increased costs for healthcare, education, and social services, while in poor countries, it can perpetuate cycles of poverty and inequality. Furthermore, overpopulation can lead to loss of biodiversity, as natural habitats are destroyed to accommodate growing human populations.To mitigate these problems, one possible solution is to implement effective family planning and education programs. By providing access to contraception, reproductive healthcare, and education, particularly for women and girls, governments and organizations can empower individuals to make informed choices about their family size. This can help to slow population growth rates, reduce poverty, and promote sustainable development. Additionally, investing in sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, and urban planning can help to ensure that the needs of growing populations are met while minimizing the negative impacts on the environment. Ultimately, addressing overpopulation requires a multi-faceted approach that involves governments, international organizations, and individuals working together to promote sustainable development and ensure a livable future for all.
1313;There are many things that can motivate people to perform well in their work. These can include the salary, job satisfaction or the chance to help others. What do you feel is the best motivation to do well at work?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"To perform well in a job, people have to be motivated. There are multiple strategies for employers to incentivise their employees. The most obvious one is the salary; however, job satisfaction and the ability to help people are other methods of improving performance at work.For the majority of the people, receiving their salary at the end of the month is their motivation. This is because money is necessary to fulfill the most basic needs and other materialistic desires. Employees see these opportunities when receiving their salary and therefore work to achieve money. Furthermore, performing well in a job can often lead to promotions with higher pay packages. To receive this, staff have to stand out positively in their jobs. Salary is therefore a key motivational tool for many workforce participants.However, money is far from being the only incentive. Another aspect affecting performance is job satisfaction. If a person is comfortable in their work, they are more likely to perform well. Therefore this motivational tool interlinks with salary, as when people are content and perform well, the chances of promotion increase. For some individuals though, only their passion can drive them. Prime examples for this are humanitarian jobs. The salaries are often not very high, but those choosing to work in this field are often very driven; their passion to help others is prioritised over their own salary.In conclusion, while income might be the most common motivational factor, it is unusual to be the sole incentive for working hard, and some people are motivated wholly due to other reasons.";When it comes to motivation at work, there are several factors that can drive individuals to perform well. While salary and job satisfaction are significant motivators, I firmly believe that the chance to help others is the most potent motivator. This is because, when people feel that their work is making a positive impact on others, they are more likely to be invested in their job and strive to do their best.For instance, teachers are often motivated by the opportunity to shape young minds and make a difference in their students' lives. Despite often being underpaid and overworked, many teachers continue to dedicate themselves to their profession because they feel a sense of purpose and fulfillment in helping their students learn and grow. Similarly, medical professionals, such as doctors and nurses, are motivated by the chance to save lives and improve the health and wellbeing of their patients. These individuals often work long hours in challenging conditions, but are driven by the knowledge that their work is having a direct and positive impact on people's lives.In addition, the chance to help others can also foster a sense of community and teamwork in the workplace. When colleagues feel that they are working together towards a common goal of helping others, they are more likely to support and motivate each other. This can lead to a more positive and productive work environment, where individuals feel valued and inspired to do their best. In conclusion, while salary and job satisfaction are important motivators, I believe that the chance to help others is the most powerful driver of performance at work. By providing a sense of purpose and fulfillment, it can inspire individuals to go above and beyond in their jobs, and create a positive and supportive work environment.
1284;There is a moral necessity today for the richer countries of the world to help the poorer countries develop in terms of feeding the population, education and health care. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The world today is often divided into two categories, more developed and less developed countries. This division is significant in terms of health, wealth and education. To minimise this gap, it is argued that richer countries are morally responsible to support the less wealthy. I, personally, feel that the prosperous countries are obligated and expected to to contribute to the development of countries with weaker economies.To address this argument, the history of the wealthy countries is relevant. Many less developed countries are former colonies, therefore the wealthy countries had a historical impact on the less wealthy. Thus, richer countries’ economies were dependent on the currently less developed countries for their rich status. Furthermore, even today the wealthy countries contribute to the wealth inequality by exploiting the inhabitants of less developed countries, giving workers lower wages than people within their own countries. Due to this dependence on poorer countries and the influence that the richer countries have had on the imbalance, it can be concluded that richer countries are indeed morally obliged to help the less wealthy countries.Opposing this is the view that each country is in charge of their own inhabitants and that therefore they need to provide health, education and basic necessities for themselves. In addition, simply providing these three services would not lead to closing the wealth gap. It would rather be helpful to invest sustainably in poorer countries and help them create their own systems, allowing these countries to be self-sufficient.In conclusion, while there is a moral necessity for wealthy countries to aid the poorer ones, simply providing basic necessities is not sufficient. A more sustainable idea would be to teach countries to plan and provide for themselves by giving economic incentives.;I strongly agree with the statement that there is a moral necessity for richer countries to help poorer countries develop in terms of feeding the population, education, and healthcare. The vast disparities in wealth and resources between nations are a pressing global concern, and it is the responsibility of more affluent countries to lend a helping hand.Firstly, the issue of feeding the population is a fundamental human right. Millions of people in developing countries suffer from hunger and malnutrition, which can have devastating effects on their health, productivity, and overall well-being. Richer countries have a moral obligation to provide food aid and support sustainable agriculture in poorer nations. For instance, the United States' Food for Peace program has been instrumental in providing emergency food assistance to countries affected by conflict, natural disasters, or economic crises.Moreover, education is a critical component of development, as it empowers individuals and communities to break the cycle of poverty. Richer countries can provide financial and technical assistance to improve educational infrastructure, teacher training, and access to quality education in poorer countries. For example, the UK's Department for International Development has launched initiatives to support education in countries like Nigeria and Pakistan, leading to significant improvements in enrollment rates and learning outcomes.Lastly, healthcare is another essential aspect of development that requires attention from richer countries. The lack of access to basic healthcare services, such as vaccination programs, maternal care, and disease prevention, can have severe consequences for public health. Wealthier nations can provide medical aid, expertise, and funding to support healthcare systems in poorer countries. For example, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, supported by richer countries, has made significant strides in combating these diseases in developing countries.In conclusion, the moral imperative for richer countries to support the development of poorer nations is clear. By providing assistance in feeding the population, education, and healthcare, richer countries can help alleviate human suffering, promote sustainable development, and reduce global inequalities. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that all people have access to basic human needs, and richer countries must take the lead in supporting this effort.
1217;There is growing evidence that man-made activities are making global temperatures higher.What might be the man-made causes of temperatures rising? How should we deal with this problem?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In the last years the problem of global warming is becaming more and more debated. One of the main causes of the temperature rising are men-made activities. Almost all the activities made by humans produce a huge impact on the natural environment. For instance, some of the usual activities made daily by people are impacting. Indeed, the chemical products they buy and use as well as the ways of trasportation's abuse can be annoverated among the main reasons for global warming. Lastly, even if it is the more impacting, there is the industral system and their production of slags.The first impact made by men-activities concerns the product they use. There are at least three kinds of products that may cause the rising of temperature. First, there are products like lacquaer and foam. Because they were beed uncontrolled used during the last decades, they have been one of the main causes of the Ozone Hole. Spray products, even if they are just suncream or hair conditionars could be very impacting because of their chemical composition. Another men-activity that impact a lot on the environment concern their use of the way of transportation. Indeed, the abuse of private ways of trasportation caused an increasement of pollution and a dramatic increase of the level of petrol in the environment. Petrol is not only one of the main reason for global warming but also the first responsible for sea's pollution. Furthermore, the dayly use of flight cause pollution in the air and now restriction on the abuse of this way of trasportation are trying to be a kind of solution to the problem.Lastly, one of the main causes of global temperatures higher is the industrial system. Indeed, they used to point to the cheaper solution to produce and eliminate the radioactive waste. The problem of a prodaction that does not take care of the environment pointed to use polluting products and machines. Furthermore, the industrial system point to produce more and more causing the waste of energy and raw materials. For instance, the fashion industry is one of the more pulluting in the world. It abuses of materials and energies whithout caring abuut the waste of them. Finally, the problem of the way in which the industries procede in elimnating waste is crucial. Indeed, in the last years they used to disperse the waste on the sea. This tendecy was increased for two reasosns: saving and speed. These are the two eassential words of industrial system.In conclusion, I think there are two main reasons that cause the raising of global temperatures that can be annoverated among the others. Those that concern the personal and daily activities of men (use of determinate products and ways of trasportation) and then those activities operate by the industrial system.;The phenomenon of rising global temperatures has become a pressing concern in recent years, and it is widely acknowledged that man-made activities are significantly contributing to this issue. Two primary man-made causes of rising temperatures are the emission of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, through the burning of fossil fuels, as well as deforestation.The combustion of fossil fuels, as occurs in vehicles, factories, and power plants, releases substantial amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which in turn, traps heat and leads to a rise in global temperatures. Furthermore, the clearance of forests for agricultural purposes or urban development not only eliminates a crucial carbon sink but also disrupts local ecosystems, exacerbating the greenhouse effect.To deal with this problem, it is essential that we adopt a multi-faceted approach. Firstly, governments and corporations must invest in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. Additionally, reforestation efforts and the implementation of sustainable land-use practices can help to restore natural carbon sinks and mitigate the effects of deforestation. On an individual level, simple actions like using public transport, carpooling, or driving electric vehicles can significantly decrease our personal carbon footprint.For instance, countries like Norway have shown remarkable progress in promoting electric vehicle use, with over 50% of new car sales being electric. Such initiatives demonstrate that with collective effort and the right policies, it is possible to make significant strides in reducing our impact on global temperatures. Ultimately, addressing the issue of rising temperatures necessitates a concerted global response, incorporating both systemic changes and individual actions to safeguard the future of our planet.
1427;There is no longer enough natural resources to sustain current levels of economic growth. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Recently, the natural resources risen dramatically across the world due to population growth. Some people state that we enough resources. However, there are some individuals who disagree with this opinion. In this essay, the issues behind this phenomenon will be examined.On the one hand, some people state that if will continue to we cannot have a comfortable life because natural resources are limited. According to a if this situation will continue, the petrol will in 2050. Moreover, it is widely said that the will increase. This will make the amount of natural .On the other hand, there are some individuals who disagree with above-mentioned perception. The natural resources will technology. For example, the of technology such as cars a positive impact the society. By using this, we can the consumption of natural resources. Eventually, we will not need natural fuel. In my opinion, of natural is , I think the loss of it a negative impact the society because won’t have a comfortable life any more.In conclusion, I agree with the idea that there is no longer enough natural resources to sustain this situation. In order to our life, the governments countries should tackle this issue.;The notion that there are insufficient natural resources to sustain current levels of economic growth has sparked intense debate. While I acknowledge the pressing concerns surrounding resource depletion, I only partially agree with this statement.On one hand, it is undeniable that the world's natural resources, such as water, oil, and minerals, are being depleted at an alarming rate. The extraction and consumption of these resources have led to severe environmental degradation, as evident in climate change, deforestation, and pollution. For instance, the World Wildlife Fund estimates that if current consumption patterns continue, we will need the resources of two planets by 2025 to sustain our lifestyle. This raises legitimate concerns about the sustainability of current economic growth models.On the other hand, I disagree that the situation is entirely hopeless. Human ingenuity and technological advancements have consistently led to innovations that mitigate resource constraints. For example, the development of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, has reduced our reliance on fossil fuels. Moreover, circular economy models and recycling technologies are being implemented to minimize waste and optimize resource utilization. These innovations demonstrate that economic growth and environmental sustainability are not mutually exclusive.In conclusion, while I agree that the current rate of resource depletion is unsustainable, I disagree that it is impossible to sustain current levels of economic growth. By embracing sustainable practices, investing in renewable energy, and promoting eco-friendly technologies, we can mitigate the pressure on natural resources. Ultimately, a balanced approach that prioritizes both economic development and environmental protection is essential to ensure a sustainable future.
1324;These days, many young people are not spending their weekends and holidays doing outdoor activities such as hiking or mountaineering. Why is that happening? How can they be encouraged to spend more time in the natural environment?;Nowadays, the younger generation tends to avoid recreational activities such as hiking or alpinism. It seems that young people prefer to spend their weekends indoors, gaming or engaging in other online activities. If that is the case, by promoting sports more actively and organising sports competitions, the schools could counteract this trend.Living in the era of technology, the wide availability and variety of online entertainment are compelling young people to spend a lot of their free time indoors, using their gadgets. Numerous relatively cheap forms of amusement, such as online games, videos, audiobooks and plenty of other activities, tempt teenagers to stay at home and lead more sedentary lifestyles. A recent survey revealed that the vast majority of students would prefer spending their weekends playing computer games, rather than in the nature. That is one clear reason why our modern youth is less interested in recreational sports.To address this issue, the school management could intervene and offer a better range of outdoor sports activities and competitions, both within the school curriculum and as extra-curricular activities. For example, high schools could increase the number of weekly football, running and climbing classes, and organise competitions at the end of each term. As a result, pushed by their desire to win, students would do more walking, jogging, running and mountaineering during the school term, in preparation for the competition. This would reduce the time spent online, lessen the students’ dependence on the Internet for entertainment, and eventually boost their desire to spend more time enjoying the natural environment.To sum up, screen addiction plays a major role in young people’s avoidance of various outdoor activities. Opening up more recreational sports and offering frequent competitions on school grounds is a great way to motivate more students to spend their leisure time in the nature.;The trend of young people spending less time outdoors, particularly on weekends and holidays, is a concerning phenomenon. One primary reason for this shift is the increasing allure of digital entertainment and social media. Many youngsters are now more inclined to spend their free time playing video games, browsing the internet, or engaging with online platforms, rather than venturing into nature. Additionally, the rise of urbanization has led to a decrease in accessible natural spaces, making it less convenient for young people to participate in outdoor activities like hiking or mountaineering.Another significant factor is the lack of awareness about the benefits of spending time in nature. Many young people are not educated about the positive impact that outdoor activities can have on their physical and mental well-being. To encourage young people to spend more time in the natural environment, it is essential to promote the advantages of outdoor activities through schools and social media. Organized group trips, such as school excursions or community-led hikes, can also make outdoor activities more appealing and accessible. Furthermore, investing in the development of parks and recreational areas within urban spaces can increase the opportunities for young people to engage with nature.Ultimately, a combination of education, accessibility, and social engagement is necessary to encourage young people to spend more time outdoors. By fostering a deeper appreciation for nature and providing the means to explore it safely and enjoyably, we can inspire a new generation to embrace outdoor activities and reap their numerous benefits. This not only enhances individual well-being but also cultivates a broader sense of environmental responsibility and stewardship among young people.
919;To be labelled a ‘Work of Art’, a painting, sculpture or other art form should display certain qualities that are unique. However, over the past century there has been a decline in the quality of prize-winning artwork and it is now possible for quite ordinary pieces of art to be labelled ‘masterpieces ’ whilst true works of art pass unnoticed.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;For centuries, artworks have been titled  'Work of Art' based on their extraordinary qualities. However, some people argue that nowadays, the standards are decreasing and the labelling of substandard artworks as 'masterpieces' has become ubiquitous. The upcoming essay will discuss why I agree that original paintings are being neglected while usual ones are being praised.Firstly, the superficial nature of humans is responsible for this change. These days, people do not see the meaning behind the painting or the message the artist is trying to convey rather they buy those paintings which are popular and contemporary. To illustrate it further, in art auctions it can be seen that when one person bids on one painting, no matter whether it is good or bad, others also start putting their money on it. Thus it is clear that normal art forms are winning prizes due to public attention.Secondly, some artists might bribe the organizers of exhibitions to promote their canvas. Indeed, there have been some recorded instances when artists were caught while signing up deals to increase the sales of their work. If a certain artwork receives publicity then it is impossible that it would not have an influence on the public. This type of promotion skews a person's opinion about a certain picture and so are forced to think about purchasing it, leaving behind original ones. Therefore, it is apparent that the diabolical activities of painters are responsible for their works being labelled as masterpieces.To conclude, the maintenance of social position and influence of painters are the prime causes for the popularity of ordinary artworks and the negligence of true works. Hence I agree with the given statement.;"The notion that a work of art should possess distinct qualities to be considered a masterpiece has been a topic of debate among art critics and enthusiasts. While some argue that the quality of prize-winning artwork has declined over the past century, I disagree. In my opinion, the definition of a work of art has evolved, and what was once considered ordinary can now be seen as extraordinary.One of the primary reasons for this shift is the changing nature of art itself. With the rise of conceptual and contemporary art, the focus has moved from technical skill to creative vision and originality. For instance, Marcel Duchamp's ""Fountain"" (1917), a urinal signed ""R. Mutt,"" challenged traditional notions of art and sparked a new wave of avant-garde movement. Similarly, the works of Andy Warhol, such as ""Campbell's Soup Cans"" (1962), blurred the lines between high and low culture, demonstrating that art can be found in the mundane.Moreover, the art world has become more diverse, with artists from various backgrounds and styles gaining recognition. The art market has expanded, and the internet has democratized the way we experience and interact with art. This increased accessibility has led to a broader definition of what constitutes a work of art. While some may view this as a decline in quality, I see it as an opportunity for innovation and experimentation.In conclusion, I believe that the decline in quality of prize-winning artwork is a subjective perception. The art world is constantly evolving, and what is considered a masterpiece today may not have been recognized as such in the past. As our understanding of art expands, so does our appreciation for the diverse range of creative expressions that surround us. Ultimately, a work of art should be judged on its ability to inspire, challenge, and engage, regardless of its technical proficiency or adherence to traditional norms."
1338;Today children are spending much more time watching TV compared to the past. Why do you think this happens? Is this a positive or a negative change?;"A trend has emerged in the last two decades with youngsters watching more TV than ever before. One of the main reasons behind this issue is the recent advancements in technology in gaming and film industries. This tendency has both pros and cons, and will be further discussed in this essay.The latest developments in video game consoles attracted both children and adults to spend extra time watching TV, compared to the past. With interactive gaming characters and high quality graphics, children are more likely to spend long hours playing games in front of the TV. A recent survey showed that TV addiction among young people, for example, has significantly increased from 5% to 80%, which was supposedly caused by the introduction of advanced gaming consoles. This increase is also partially due to films, drama series and cartoons being easily available on pirated websites and various gaming platforms.This trend has had more negative than positive effects on young citizens. More time spent watching TV adversely affects the mental and physical wellbeing of a child. For instance, the obesity ratio among young individuals in the past 10 years has risen dramatically; this has caused further health problems such as anxiety and depression. However, TV can also be used in a positive way. It is a great source of information that can help youngsters increase their knowledge and succeed in their future careers.In conclusion, recent breakthroughs in technology are driving up the amount of time our youngsters are spending in front of their TV screens. This can do more harm than good if we don’t regulate the use of TV, but parents have the power to make TV time useful and beneficial for their children.";The amount of time children spend watching TV has significantly increased compared to the past. This phenomenon can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the widespread availability and accessibility of TVs and other viewing devices have made it easier for children to watch TV for extended periods. Moreover, the vast array of child-friendly programming and channels has also contributed to this trend. Parents, often overwhelmed with work and other responsibilities, may also use TV as a convenient means of keeping their children occupied and entertained.However, this change is largely negative. Excessive TV watching has been linked to a range of negative effects on children's physical and mental health, including obesity, decreased attention span, and decreased academic performance. Furthermore, watching TV can be a passive activity that limits children's opportunities for creative play, social interaction, and outdoor activities, which are essential for their cognitive, emotional, and physical development.In addition, excessive TV watching can also expose children to inappropriate content, such as violence, advertising, and stereotypes, which can have a profound impact on their values, attitudes, and behaviors. Parents and caregivers should be aware of these risks and take steps to limit and monitor their children's TV watching, encouraging more balanced and engaging activities, such as reading, sports, and creative pursuits. By doing so, we can help children develop healthy habits, a strong sense of self, and a broad range of skills that will benefit them throughout their lives. Ultimately, it is crucial that we address this issue and promote a more active, creative, and socially engaged childhood for the well-being and development of our children.
603;Today family members do not eat meals together. Why does this happen? Is this a positive or negative developmentGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Dinner tables are no longer a place for family reunion in today's society. Reasons from many aspects account for this phenomenon which pose a huge threat to the happiness of family and the harmony of society.Causes vary from person to person. Some people, especially the young believing that conflicts are common on dinner tables, tend to have meals with their friends rather than their family members. But most people are deprived of their rights by the development of society. Too busy to get home at dinner time, people have to eat meals near workplace. Also, with the job diversity increasing, rarely can family members with different timetables eat meals at the same period. For instance, a bank agent getting home at 6 pm tends to miss her doctor husband leaving home at 5 pm for emergency work.It is the advantages of sharing meals with family that attach great importance to this event. Time for communication is so critical that families lacking such opportunities are often full of misunderstandings and quarrels. Not only can this development increase the divorce rate but it may also decrease the marriage rate. Because support and care from family, the previous harbor, is deprived and people see no significance from getting married. With such phenomenon prevailing, the negative emotions may take advantage in the society. Loneliness, distress and helplessness stike those always eating alone.In a nutshell, taking the damage to both families and societies into consideration, various solutions should be put forward to the roots behind the situation.;The traditional family dinner, where all members gather to share a meal, has become a rarity in today's fast-paced world. With increasingly busy schedules, family members often find themselves eating alone or on-the-go. This trend is largely attributed to the demands of modern life, where work, school, and extracurricular activities take precedence over family time.In my opinion, this development is largely negative. Eating meals together as a family provides an opportunity for bonding, sharing experiences, and creating lasting memories. When family members eat alone, they miss out on these essential interactions, leading to a sense of disconnection and isolation. Furthermore, research has shown that regular family meals are linked to improved communication, emotional well-being, and even academic performance in children.Another reason why this trend is negative is that it can lead to unhealthy eating habits. When individuals eat alone, they are more likely to opt for convenience foods or takeout, which are often high in calories, salt, and sugar. In contrast, family meals often involve home-cooked meals, which tend to be healthier and more balanced. For instance, in my own family, we make a conscious effort to eat together at least a few times a week, and as a result, we have developed healthier eating habits and a stronger sense of unity.In conclusion, the decline of family meals is a negative development that can have far-reaching consequences on our physical and emotional well-being. By prioritizing family time and making an effort to eat together, we can foster a sense of togetherness, promote healthy habits, and create lasting memories. As individuals, we must recognize the importance of family meals and strive to preserve this essential tradition in our increasingly busy lives.
883;Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;There is no doubt that nowadays advertising plays a very strong role in saling goods. The high rate of sales does not always mean the real needs of some goods. In this essay, i will discuss both views and draw my personal conclusion.In terms of advertising's power in increasing sales of popular consumer goods, advertising has an essencial role these days in sales. The main reason given to support this claim is advertisnig attracts people and inform people about the new and special products in a very special way. To illustrate, using social media for marketing and advertising raise sales dramatecly. People spend most of their times to watch what is in the social media and that means social media is the best way to do your marketing.However, some people say that people buy these products not because they really need them but because they like the way that was used to advertise these products. On the other hand, some times people purchase goods because they have seen them or heard about them from others or from the social media not due to their needs of these products.In conclusion, I believe that increasing the sales of some popular consumer goods show how strong is advertising and how advertising plays a crucial role in saling products. Also, smart business owners should think about advertising as a fast way to sale their goods. As was previously menthond, people can be attracted by all kinds of advertising and that definitly lead to increasing the sale rate.;The notion that high sales of popular consumer goods are a direct result of advertising rather than genuine societal needs has sparked a heated debate. In my opinion, I agree to a large extent that advertising plays a significant role in driving sales, but I also believe that real needs of the society cannot be entirely disregarded.On the one hand, advertising has become an incredibly powerful tool in shaping consumer behavior. Through clever marketing strategies and compelling narratives, advertisers can create a perceived need for a product, even if it does not necessarily fulfill a fundamental requirement. For instance, the annual release of new smartphone models often creates a frenzy among consumers, with many feeling pressured to upgrade to the latest device. In such cases, advertising undoubtedly contributes to the high sales figures, as people are convinced that they need the latest product to stay connected and relevant.On the other hand, it is essential to acknowledge that some consumer goods do cater to genuine societal needs. For example, the sales of healthcare products, food, and clothing are often driven by real demands rather than just advertising. People require these essential goods to survive and maintain a basic standard of living. Furthermore, some products may address specific needs or problems that people face, such as energy-efficient appliances or water purification systems.In conclusion, while advertising undoubtedly influences consumer behavior and contributes to high sales, it is not the sole driver. Real needs of the society also play a significant role in determining the demand for certain products. A balanced perspective recognizes that both factors intersect and influence each other, with advertising amplifying and shaping the way people perceive and respond to their genuine needs. Ultimately, the relationship between advertising, sales, and societal needs is complex, and a nuanced understanding is necessary to appreciate the dynamics at play.
1328;Today’s young generation is facing many problems at school and at home. What are the problems? What can parents do to help their teenage children?;"Young people today are under a lot of pressure, which seems to come from many directions. The problems they are experiencing happen not only at school, but also at home, and it seems that without adult guidance, our young generation will continue to struggle.Teenage years have never been simple, and many would agree that the amount of challenges has only increased with the passage of time. Bullying has been a problem for quite a while, and children and adolescents would have experienced it at school in the past, but then it would stop at home. At present, however, things have been made worse by social media penetrating the supposedly safe space of our teenagers. The unfortunate behaviour of their peers can now reach them even in their bedrooms, causing them constant distress.Another issue troubling many young people is the pressure to succeed by their families. Whether at school or at home, they often feel as if they are not smart enough, which creates overwhelm and despair. Understandably, their parents are pursuing a worthy goal of ensuring their children get a great start in life; however, many teens feel that they are failing their families when they don’t live up to their expectations. This often leads to dishonest and unethical behaviour, such as cheating on tests or plagiarising other students’ work. When uncovered, these incidents have a profound effect on young people’s future careers, not to mention their emotional well-being.It is hard to underestimate the importance of parental support to navigating life as a young person. From helping teens build a positive body image and self-esteem, to handling classmates’ difficult behaviour, to guidance where study is concerned, parents can make a world of difference. Talking to their sons and daughters about matters that worry them, listening and making non-judgmental suggestions are great ways to help. Getting a professional involved where necessary and engaging with teachers, councilors and coaches is another opportunity for parents to provide assistance. Last but not least, parents can make their children better and happier people by simply giving them unconditional love.To sum up, being a young person in the modern world isn’t easy. By banding together and paying careful attention to their teens, families can help them overcome any obstacles to becoming successful adults.";The young generation of today is indeed facing a multitude of problems both at school and at home. Some of the most prevalent issues include academic pressure, social media addiction, and bullying. At school, students are often overwhelmed by the burden of homework, exams, and extracurricular activities, leading to stress and anxiety. Furthermore, the rise of social media has created a culture of comparison and competition, which can have devastating effects on a teenager's self-esteem and mental health.At home, many teenagers face problems such as family conflicts, lack of communication with parents, and limited freedom. Parents' high expectations and strict rules can lead to rebellion and a sense of suffocation among teenagers. To help their teenage children navigate these challenges, parents can play a vital role. Firstly, parents should maintain open and honest communication with their children, listening to their concerns and validating their feelings. This will help build trust and create a safe space for teenagers to express themselves.Additionally, parents can help by setting realistic expectations and providing emotional support. They can also encourage their children to engage in extracurricular activities and hobbies that promote mental and physical well-being. Moreover, parents should be aware of their children's online activities and have regular conversations about social media usage and its potential risks. By being supportive, understanding, and involved, parents can help their teenage children develop resilience, self-confidence, and essential life skills to overcome the problems they face at school and at home. Ultimately, by working together, parents and teenagers can build a stronger, more loving relationship that fosters a positive and healthy environment for growth and development.
1310;Tourism today creates a variety of problems, such as pollution due to flights, transport and dirty water.Do you think that governments should impose extra taxes on flights or accommodation to restrict today’s tourism industry?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Travelling today is simple to the extent that within twelve hours one can travel from Europe to Singapore, crossing nearly the whole globe. Based on this simplicity, tourism has changed significantly over the years. While in the past a family would be proud to drive two hours to a lake, many families now think nothing of travelling to the far side of the world. This also has a downside as increased pollution is a result. Extra taxes on flights or accommodation have therefore been offered as a solution so as to increase the cost of tourism and reduce its popularity.No matter what major transportation is used, travelling creates pollution. To decrease the amount of pollution caused by tourism, the tourism industry itself would have to be weakened. If these increased taxes are based on travelling distance, people would be more willing to stay closer to their home country, as for many even a slight increase would mean that their planned holidays would be too expensive. Accommodation taxes would raise holiday costs no matter the distance travelled. Therefore, if increased taxes were levied on travel and accommodation, tourism and therefore pollution would decrease.On the other hand, the main transport methods that would be impacted by imposing extra taxes would be communal ones, such as planes, trains and buses, and increasing the taxes would also impact non-tourists. Also, holidays are a vital part of ordinary people’s lives, as they escape from work and stress, and get to spend valuable time with their families. Stopping people travelling would greatly impact some simple pleasures of ordinary life.In conclusion, while tourism impacts the environment significantly, simply introducing extra taxes on transport or accommodation is a drastic measure. It could be more valuable to change the methods of transportation to decrease pollution, instead making people stay close to home.;The tourism industry has experienced unprecedented growth in recent years, with millions of people traveling across the globe every day. However, this surge in tourism has created a plethora of problems, including pollution, environmental degradation, and strain on local resources. One of the most significant concerns is the pollution caused by flights, transport, and dirty water. In light of these issues, the question arises whether governments should impose extra taxes on flights or accommodation to restrict the tourism industry.In my opinion, imposing extra taxes on flights or accommodation is a viable solution to mitigate the negative impacts of tourism. By levying additional taxes, governments can discourage excessive travel and generate revenue that can be used to offset the environmental costs of tourism. For instance, the city of Venice, which is notorious for its overcrowding and pollution, has introduced a tourist tax to manage the influx of visitors and fund conservation efforts. Similarly, the government of New Zealand has imposed a tourist tax to protect its unique biodiversity and pristine environment.Moreover, extra taxes can also incentivize the tourism industry to adopt more sustainable practices, such as investing in renewable energy, reducing waste, and promoting eco-friendly accommodations. This, in turn, can create a more responsible and environmentally-conscious tourism sector. Additionally, the revenue generated from these taxes can be used to support local communities and promote cultural heritage, thereby ensuring that the benefits of tourism are shared equitably.However, it is essential to strike a balance between regulating tourism and preserving the economic benefits it brings to local economies. Overly restrictive taxation could harm small businesses and communities that rely heavily on tourism. Ultimately, a well-designed tax system that takes into account the unique needs and challenges of each destination can help mitigate the problems associated with tourism while still allowing people to explore and appreciate the world's diverse cultures and natural wonders.
861;Traffic and housing problems could be solved by moving large companies, factories and their employees to the countryside.Do you agree or disagree?;Many metropolises are facing challenges, including traffic gams and serious lacking of housing available for families to live, particular in the developed countries. The governments are looking for a way to lessen the volume of traffic in the cities and to increase the number of housing provision over the metropolises. Some people advocate the businesses including large corporations and factories along with their employees moving to the suburbs which is the best way to figure out the metropolitan problems. Is this a sheer solution for these challenges faced by the cities?Economy boom in a country is accompanied with a number of problems incurred in the cities due to the multitudes living in there. It is no wonder that metropolises represent more job opportunities available and better education system to next generations. These are strong pull factors appealing people to stay in the cities despite the higher cost in living. A larger number of populations in the cities not only result in a severe shortage of housing where there is a higher demand of housing over the available supply, but also bring the higher volume of traffic across the cities, particular in a peak hour when a thousand and one employees commuting to work and students going to schools. Some people believe the working location shifting to rural areas is a solution that enables to lessen the frequent usage of roads in cities. Simultaneously, it is assumed that the housing issue can be solved naturally arising from the migration of their employees into the suburban town next to their working place.The business allocated to suburbs alone is rarely considered enough to tackle these problems. A place to live requires the basic facilities to serve for clothing, food, housing and transportation which are basic needs of human. If there is a working place and residential area only in the suburban town without any infrastructures, people have no choice to drive their vehicles back and forth between cities and their living places for the general consumption. As a consequence, the traffic congestion in cities will be worsen combining with the significant deterioration of air quality in the countryside due to an increase in the emission of the greenhouse gases. Therefore, the governments play a key role to establish a neighborhood which could be self-sufficient communities outside of their larger metropolitan areas. This may be a feasible and effective way to minimize the metropolitan issues.My own view is that the shifting strategies in suburbs can help lessen the challenges faced by metropolises. But the governments should take the smart planning into consideration in which the employment bases with the living infrastructures are developed in the suburban town.;The notion that relocating large companies, factories, and their employees to the countryside could alleviate traffic and housing problems in urban areas is an intriguing one. While this idea may seem like a viable solution, it is not without its drawbacks. In my opinion, I partially agree with this statement.On the one hand, relocating large companies and factories to rural areas could indeed help reduce traffic congestion and alleviate housing shortages in cities. By decentralizing industries, the number of commuters traveling to and from urban centers would decrease, leading to less traffic and a reduction in air pollution. Additionally, the demand for housing in cities would also decrease, potentially leading to more affordable housing options for residents.On the other hand, relocating entire industries to the countryside could have significant economic and social implications for both urban and rural areas. For instance, rural areas may lack the necessary infrastructure to support large-scale industrial activities, and the cost of establishing such infrastructure could be prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, the relocation of factories and companies could lead to job losses in urban areas, as well as disrupt the social fabric of communities that have formed around these industries.In conclusion, while relocating large companies and factories to the countryside may offer some benefits in terms of reducing traffic and housing problems, it is not a straightforward solution. A more nuanced approach, such as investing in sustainable urban planning and transportation systems, may be more effective in addressing these issues. Ultimately, a balanced and multifaceted strategy is needed to address the complex problems of traffic and housing in urban areas.
1229;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;While some people argue that equal numbers of male and female students should be accepted in every major, I personally disagree with this statement.There are a number of arguments that can support my stance. To begin with, it is impossible to enroll equal genders of students in every subject. It is true that some faculties are underrepresented by a particular gender. For example, STEM subjects usually have more male students than females, but the opposite is true in educational-related subjects, which phenomenon seems to violate the principle that we fight endeavor today, gender equality. Therefore, people want to accept equal numbers of students to achieve a gender balance in every subject. However, the reality is that different genders prefer to study different subjects themselves, but not because of the unequal opportunity. According to one of the research, women show a higher interest in subjects like education, psychology and arts rather than science-related subjects. As a result, it is apparent that admitting equivalent proportions of male and female students can hardly be achieved.In addition, it will deprive students of chances to make their own choices if universities enroll both genders equally in every subject mandatorily. It should be noted that it is students' right to select the subjects freely in college. If students cannot register for the subjects they want to study just because there are not enough quotas left for particular gender of students, or they are forced to study some subjects they are not interested in just because they need to fulfill the gender requirement in the class, it will hinder students' learning in the long-run.To conclude, universities should not enroll equal gender students in every subject as it is impossible to achieve and may deprive students the freedom to choose the major they want to study.;The idea of universities accepting equal numbers of male and female students in every subject has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that this approach promotes gender equality, others claim that it can lead to discrimination and inefficiency. In my opinion, I partially agree with this statement.On the one hand, having an equal number of male and female students in every subject can help to bridge the gender gap in certain fields, as seen in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects where men traditionally outnumber women. By promoting female participation in these areas, universities can foster a more diverse and inclusive learning environment. For instance, many universities have successfully implemented programs to encourage female students to pursue STEM subjects, resulting in a significant increase in female enrollment and graduation rates.On the other hand, I disagree with the idea of enforcing a strict 50-50 ratio in every subject. This approach can lead to discrimination against more qualified candidates of one gender in favor of less qualified candidates of the other gender. Moreover, some subjects may naturally attract more students of one gender due to inherent interests or aptitudes. For example, nursing and childcare courses often have a higher enrollment of female students, while engineering and computer science courses may have more male students. Imposing a strict gender ratio in these cases could compromise the quality of education and limit the opportunities for students who are genuinely passionate about a particular subject.In conclusion, while promoting gender equality in university enrollment is essential, I believe that a flexible and nuanced approach is necessary. Rather than enforcing a strict 50-50 ratio, universities should focus on creating an inclusive and supportive environment that encourages students of all genders to pursue their interests and passions. By doing so, we can promote diversity and equality without compromising the quality of education.
1433;Universities should allocate the same amount of money to their sport activities as they allocate to their libraries. Do you agree or disagree?;Yes, I do feel that universities should have an equal budget for their libraries as well as sport activities. It is our general belief that a good player can not be good student and hence we restrict our children’s sport activities at college level. Moreover, an academic degree has much more value than sport activities which naturally compels students to focus more on their studies than their interest in sport.Most of the universities keep sports at of their priority list, good players do not get enough facilities and to improve their skills and eventually they their interest.Universities can play substantial role in shaping this upcoming talent by providing good trainers and which is otherwise too expensive to afford. Also it will attract other students sports and inculcate importance of physical fitness in them.Universities should produce in all fields rather than only concentrating on progress of scholars. Hence, I feel that universities should allot equal amounts of money to as well as sport activities.;The allocation of university funds is a topic of ongoing debate, with some arguing that sports activities and libraries should receive equal financial support. While I understand the importance of sports in promoting student well-being and campus life, I strongly disagree with the idea of allocating the same amount of money to sports activities as to libraries.Libraries are the backbone of academic institutions, providing students with access to a vast array of resources, including books, journals, and online databases. These resources are essential for students to complete their coursework, conduct research, and develop their critical thinking skills. In contrast, sports activities, although beneficial for students' physical and mental health, are not as crucial to the academic mission of the university. Furthermore, libraries cater to a much larger segment of the student population, as every student requires access to library resources to complete their degree, whereas sports activities tend to benefit a smaller, albeit still significant, portion of the student body.Additionally, libraries require significant investments in infrastructure, technology, and personnel to maintain and update their collections, which is a costly endeavor. Allocating equal funds to sports activities would likely lead to a reduction in the quality and availability of library resources, ultimately hindering students' ability to succeed academically. Instead, universities should strike a balance between supporting sports activities and maintaining their libraries, recognizing the unique importance of each to the university community. By prioritizing library funding, universities can ensure that their students have access to the resources they need to succeed, while still providing opportunities for students to engage in sports and other extracurricular activities.
1387;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;Today computers are used almost everywhere, it is impossible to imagine our life without PCs, Internet, mobile phones and other computer devices. It is reasonable to think that people look forward to the future of computers., computers make our life easier, we can easily get information about any product we plan to buy or place we plan to visit in a second using a personal computer and . Scientists predict that in the nearest future it will be possible to smell a new perfume using the Internet and watch 3D scenes at home like we do in the movie theater. According to forecasts of HR agencies machines will replace jobs of cashiers, and civil and military pilots. Some corporations in Japan are already sellinghousewife-robots, which help old people to keep their homes clean.Despite the fact that computers help us, they make us dependent. Apparently, people spend more time behind monitors than ever before. And some of them feel a need for more time to be spent with people in live contact. In addition, a breakdown of one of the important modules of a specific computer can entail serious consequences. to mention the computer problem that occurred in the end of 1990s, a problem related to the coming year 2000 (Y2K) and catastrophes that were predicted. Fortunately imminent disasters did not happen. However, it is difficult to imagine what could if all the predictions came true.We live in a technological era, computers penetrated everywhere with all benefits they provide and all dangers they hide. However we are satisfied with them and sometimes we even thank them because they help us in communicating, studying, doing business, entertaining and saving lives in critical situations.;The increasing reliance on computers in various aspects of life is a phenomenon that has sparked intense debate. As computers continue to advance and improve, the scope of their applications is expanding exponentially. In the future, it is likely that computers will be used in even more critical areas such as healthcare, where they will aid in complex surgeries and diagnose diseases more accurately. They may also be used to manage and conserve natural resources, predict and mitigate the effects of natural disasters, and enhance the overall quality of life.Moreover, computers will play a pivotal role in space exploration, facilitating deeper and more extensive research into the cosmos. The benefits of this dependence on computers are multifaceted, including enhanced efficiency, precision, and speed. Computers enable businesses to process vast amounts of data, facilitate global communication, and automate mundane tasks, thereby increasing productivity and reducing errors.However, this dependence also raises concerns about privacy, security, and job displacement. As computers assume more responsibilities, there is a growing risk of cyber-attacks, data breaches, and unemployment. Furthermore, over-reliance on computers can erode traditional skills and reduce human interaction, potentially leading to social isolation and decreased emotional intelligence.In conclusion, while the benefits of computer dependence are undeniable, it is crucial to approach this trend with a balanced perspective. By acknowledging both the advantages and the risks, we can work towards harnessing the potential of computers to improve our lives without compromising our well-being and humanity. Ultimately, a cautious and informed embrace of technology will enable us to maximize its benefits while mitigating its negative consequences.
1396;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in the future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;In the last two decades cybernetics have experienced a major breakthrough .This led to the utilization of computers in nearly all parts of our daily life, from personal computers to the ones performing complicated surgeries. Surely the uptake of this technology facilitates a lot of difficult tasks but is this excessive ripping the warmth out of our lives? .Most of the daily tasks individual experiences are time and effort consuming. These two qualities could be tremendously saved by the use of computers. The average period required to prepare a decent meal for a middle-class family is around an hour to hour and a half when using traditional methods. This time could be literally reduced to half if computerized are used instead. Moreover, a busy businessman is enabled to easily close a profitable deal with just a touch highly programmed laptop while enjoying his family vacation and not having to exert an extra effort of traveling long distances in order to a deal.On the other hand, new generations are growing remarkably dependent on these modern utilities, which makes them handicapped when it comes to a cup of tea. , psychologists suggest that one of the main reasons for rate increase is the recent electric inventions. This is due to the fact that humans by nature stay emotionally healthy through socializing, but due to the importance of modern technology to maintain a financially satisfying standard of life they gradually themselves. As time passes by each of these individuals gets stuck in a vicious circle of loneliness that eventually leads to suicidal attempts especially among youngsters.In conclusion, similarly to every other invention computers have their benefits and drawbacks, I personally think it all depends upon how we use the given tools . Moderation is the key here to keep the balance and allow us to live in harmony.;The advent of computers has revolutionized the way we live and work. Their application is vast and diverse, ranging from business and healthcare to crime detection and aviation. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that computers will be used for even more complex and innovative tasks in the future. For instance, they may be used to manage and analyze large amounts of data in fields such as climate science and medicine, leading to breakthroughs and discoveries that were previously unimaginable.Furthermore, computers may also be used to enhance education, entertainment, and communication. Virtual and augmented reality technologies, for example, may become indistinguishable from reality itself, transforming the way we learn, socialize, and experience leisure activities. Additionally, computers may be used to improve infrastructure, such as traffic management and energy grids, making our daily lives more efficient and sustainable.However, our increasing dependence on computers also raises concerns about the potential risks and drawbacks. Over-reliance on technology can lead to job losses, as automation replaces human workers, and can also exacerbate issues of privacy and security. Moreover, the homogenization of information and the spread of misinformation through digital media can have unintended consequences on our social and cultural fabric.In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly improved many aspects of our lives, it is crucial to maintain a balanced perspective on their benefits and limitations. As we continue to develop and rely on computers, we must also prioritize human judgment, critical thinking, and empathy to ensure that technology serves to augment, rather than replace, human connection and ingenuity. By being aware of the potential risks and taking steps to mitigate them, we can harness the power of computers to create a brighter, more sustainable future for all.
1356;What are the difficulties of learning a foreign language, and how to overcome them?;Many people believe that learning a foreign language is a very difficult task. What are the most difficult things about learning a foreign language? What is the best way to overcome them? Explain and include your personal experience or knowledge of these problems.It is true that acquiring new language skills is by no means an easy task. Language learners might encounter several challenges such as unfamiliar accents or grammar structures a foreign language. However, in my opinion, such difficulties can be tackled by a well-rounded education system.When it comes to languages, it is undeniably crucial to get used to a native accent and intonation for effective communication. However, picking up an accurate accent can be enormously difficult, especially for adult learners because of their lack of language learning ability. If a language learner has an unrecognisable accent and intonation, they would not be understood by native speakers. On top of that, each language has different grammar and typical grammatical sequencing of words. For example, Korean sentences always end with verbs whilst English not, which means that a Korean English-learner should the correct order of words.Despite the aforementioned difficulties, I strongly believe that everyone can master a foreign language when a couple of feasible steps are taken. Firstly, it is more important than anything to start learning a new language at a young age. By incorporating foreign language programmes in the primary school curriculum, children can easily be exposed to languages of the world and eventually acquire language skills without difficulties. Secondly, the government can financially subsidise schools to run student exchange programmes that help adolescents to get experiences abroad and make friends overseas while improving their foreign language in a way.In conclusion, I believe that individuals can have difficulties in learning a new language because of different accents and unfamiliar grammar, however, these problems can be overcome by a good quality of education system subsidised by governments.The writer covered the task by talking about some difficult aspects of learning a new language and steps to overcome them. The ideas are presented in an orderly way, their logical sequencing and the use of paragraphing make this essay easy to follow. Skillful use of linking words and expressions helps the writer maintain coherence and cohesion. Word choice needs some more attention in this essay (see suggested corrections for expressions underlined in blue), however, overall this essay seems to be worthy of IELTS Band 8.;Learning a foreign language can be a daunting task, filled with numerous difficulties that can hinder one's progress. One of the primary difficulties is the pronunciation of unfamiliar sounds and intonations. Many languages have unique phonetic characteristics that do not exist in one's native language, making it challenging to produce and recognize them accurately. Additionally, the grammar and syntax of a foreign language can be vastly different from those of one's native language, leading to confusion and difficulty in constructing coherent sentences.Another significant obstacle is the acquisition of vocabulary. Learning a new language requires memorizing a vast number of words, phrases, and expressions, which can be overwhelming. Furthermore, the cultural nuances and context-specific meanings of words can be tricky to grasp, leading to misunderstandings and miscommunications.However, there are several strategies that can help overcome these difficulties. Firstly, immersion in the language is crucial, which can be achieved through listening to music, watching movies, and engaging in conversations with native speakers. Language learning apps and online resources can also provide interactive and engaging lessons, helping to build vocabulary and grammar skills. Moreover, practicing consistently, even if it's just for a few minutes each day, can help solidify new language patterns and build confidence.Ultimately, overcoming the difficulties of learning a foreign language requires persistence, dedication, and a willingness to make mistakes. By acknowledging the challenges and employing effective learning strategies, individuals can break down the barriers and unlock the doors to a new world of communication and cultural understanding. With the right mindset and approach, learning a foreign language can be a rewarding and enriching experience that broadens one's perspectives and fosters global connection.
1348;When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers (agree/disagree);When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers for people to spend their free time. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Sample EssaySome people argue that town planners should have a preference for more parks and gyms to be created than business districts and shopping malls. While I understand the concerns of people who hold this opinion, it seems to me that shopping centers are just as important as parks and gyms in a town.There are reasons why public facilities are crucial to city inhabitants. First of all, they provide suitable spaces and equipment for people to exercise. For example, people can go jogging in the park and play tennis or basketball at the sports stadium. That helps to keep their bodies fit and it also elevates their mood during the day. Besides, parks and sports facilities are good spots for people to socialize with their neighbors. People can connect with others when they are playing sports or talking casually with passers by in the park. A harmonious relationship between residents helps build a caring and friendly neighborhood.Although parks and gyms give the town dwellers all kinds of benefits, I would like to point out the importance of shopping malls to the district. Firstly, a shopping center could make shopping more convenient for the local residents. It would enable them to easily purchase things in town and transport them home with less effort and at lower cost. They would not need to spend extra money on transportation or shipping of the goods. Secondly, a shopping mall can provide employment. Locals can find work in retail, maintenance or security of the mall, hence earning an income to support their families.In conclusion, although parks and sports facilities serve as places for exercise and social activities for city dwellers, I believe that shopping centers are equally important, since they can provide job opportunities and convenience to the town residents.This essay would score well on Task Achievement because it addresses all parts of the question, discusses reasons for and against building more parks than shopping malls and expresses the opinion of the writer. The main ideas are organized well and explained coherently. The range of vocabulary is adequate for the requirements of the task response. Overall, this essay could get Band 8 in IELTS.;I strongly agree that when new towns are planned, it is essential to prioritize the construction of more public parks or sports facilities over shopping centers. This approach has numerous benefits for the well-being and quality of life of the residents.First and foremost, public parks and sports facilities provide green spaces where people can engage in physical activities, relax, and socialize. In an era where sedentary lifestyles and urbanization are increasingly prevalent, these areas serve as vital oases that promote physical health, mental well-being, and community cohesion. By allocating more space to such facilities, new towns can foster healthier, happier populations.Additionally, an abundance of public parks and sports facilities can contribute to the aesthetic appeal and environmental sustainability of a town. Green areas help in maintaining air quality, mitigating the urban heat island effect, and supporting local biodiversity. This not only enhances the living environment but also makes the town more attractive to potential residents and visitors, thereby boosting local economies through tourism and talent attraction.In contrast, while shopping centers are important for economic activity, they do not offer the same breadth of benefits as public parks and sports facilities. The rise of online shopping also suggests that the need for extensive physical retail space may be diminishing. Moreover, prioritizing public spaces over commercial ones can lead to more balanced and resilient communities, where residents have ample opportunities for recreation, socialization, and personal development.In conclusion, prioritizing the construction of public parks and sports facilities over shopping centers in new town planning is a forward-thinking strategy. It addresses pressing issues related to public health, environmental sustainability, and community building, ultimately leading to the creation of vibrant, livable, and thriving towns.
47;While many people go to university for academic study, more people should be encouraged to do vocational training because there is a lack of qualified workers such as electricians and plumbers. Do you agree or disagree?;Some believe that people should be encouraged more to study practical courses than going to university to fulfill the lack of workforce in practical areas. I agree with this proposal to some degree, because, from my knowledge, there is a lack in both fields, academic and vocational experts. Moreover, academic studies and vocational ones are equally important for every society, and not everybody can study the same thing, so both studies should be encouraged.Qualified workers and professional academics are equally needed in many parts of the world. This is because as the population grows the people's needs do it too, and this happens in all shapes and areas. While living in Argentina, I noticed the need of professionals in fields such as medicine and technology, especially robotics. In England, however, I observed the lack of plumers and carpenters. Consequently, every country needs different things.Furthermore, if strong encouragement is put on studying vocational courses only, this could be detrimental to the academic field. Essentially, both study systems are equally important. A hospital needs doctors to treat people as well as electricians to maintain the building. Besides, not everybody is good at everything. Some might be good at performing practical tasks and some good at thinking. In my family, I am the one who studied at the university, but my sister studied dressmaking. Both of us have jobs nowadays.In conclusion, I believe that the two types of studies should be stimulated. Countries worldwide are in lack of different experts, either in the vocational or academic field, hence, both workers are equally essential and needed. Besides and more importantly, not every individual can study the same subject or perform in the same area.;The notion that more individuals should pursue vocational training rather than academic study at university has gained significant attention in recent years. I agree with this statement, as the dearth of skilled workers in trades such as electrical and plumbing services has become a pressing concern. Vocational training provides students with practical skills and hands-on experience, which are essential for excelling in these professions. In contrast, academic studies often focus on theoretical knowledge, leaving graduates without the necessary expertise to fill the gap in the job market. By encouraging more people to undertake vocational training, the shortage of qualified electricians, plumbers, and other skilled workers can be alleviated, ultimately benefiting the economy and society as a whole.Furthermore, vocational training offers numerous benefits, including shorter training periods, which enable students to enter the workforce sooner, and lower tuition fees compared to university programs. This makes it an attractive option for those who wish to acquire a profession without being burdened by hefty student loans. Additionally, vocational training can lead to well-paying jobs, with electricians and plumbers being among the most in-demand and highest-paying professions.In conclusion, I firmly believe that more people should be encouraged to pursue vocational training. The lack of skilled workers in essential trades is a significant issue that needs to be addressed. By promoting vocational training, we can provide individuals with the skills and knowledge required to fill the gap in the job market, ultimately contributing to the overall development and prosperity of our society. Therefore, it is imperative that we shift our focus towards vocational training and provide the necessary support and resources to those who wish to pursue a career in these vital professions.
1380;Why do criminals commit another offence after being punished?;"Many offenders commit more crimes after serving the first punishment. Why is this happening, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?It is true that some criminals commit crimes again after they have been punished. While there are several reasons for this alarming trend, some effective measures can be taken by governments to tackle this problem.There are two main reasons for re-offenders. Firstly, the prison system can make the situation worse. Criminals put together in prison and they make friends with other offenders. While they are locked up in prison, they do not have much to do there, and they would exchange information about what they have done before they came to the prison or they may plan crimes with other inmates. Secondly, offenders often do not have any other means of earning money. They are poor, uneducated and lacking skills needed to maintain a job. Also, a criminal record makes finding a job difficult as people usually avoid hiring .To solve this problem, governments should focus on rehabilitation of criminals rather than punishment. Above all, prisons need vocational training which inmates to prepare for life outside the prison. They can learn practical skills such as computer programming, car maintenance and graphic design. In this way, they can be hired for a position that requires this certain knowledge and skills. Community service is another way to reform offenders. Rather than being locked up in prison with other inmates, offenders can help society and become useful to their local community, and these activities would eliminate the negative influence that prisons can have.In conclusion, it is true the one of the problems our community; it can be solved by focusing rather than punishment itself.This is a good essay. The requirements of the task statement are covered, the reasoning is logical and presented in a coherent, easy to follow way, the range of vocabulary is wide enough and the writer shows fluency and flexibility. Some minor errors in this essay include word choice and preposition errors (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows suggested corrections). Overall this looks like an IELTS Band 8 essay.";The phenomenon of criminals committing another offence after being punished is a complex and multifaceted issue. Despite the intended deterrent effect of punishment, many individuals who have been convicted and punished for a crime go on to commit another offence. There are several reasons that contribute to this trend.One primary reason is that punishment, particularly incarceration, does not necessarily address the underlying causes of criminal behavior. Many offenders have underlying issues such as poverty, lack of education, or substance abuse problems that are not adequately addressed by the punishment. Without proper rehabilitation and support, these individuals are likely to revert to their previous behavior once they are released back into their communities.Another reason is the lack of effective rehabilitation programs within the criminal justice system. While the primary goal of punishment is to deter crime, many prisons fail to provide adequate resources and support for offenders to reform and reintegrate into society. As a result, offenders are often released without the necessary skills, tools, or support to lead a law-abiding life, increasing the likelihood of recidivism.Additionally, societal factors such as poverty, unemployment, and social exclusion also play a significant role in the cycle of recidivism. Offenders who are released from prison often face significant barriers to reintegrating into society, including difficulty finding employment, housing, and rebuilding social networks. Without a supportive environment and opportunities for rehabilitation, it is challenging for individuals to break the cycle of crime.In conclusion, the reasons why criminals commit another offence after being punished are complex and deeply rooted in the individual, societal, and systemic factors. To effectively reduce recidivism, it is essential to address the underlying causes of criminal behavior, provide effective rehabilitation programs, and support offenders in their reintegration into society. By adopting a more holistic approach to crime and punishment, we can work towards breaking the cycle of recidivism and creating safer, more just communities.
1400;With all the problems in the world today, spending money on space exploration is a complete waste. The money could be better spent on other causes.;, every day, every year, celebrates its achievements in space exploration. However, it is now the time to question how meaningful these blasts are.First, until all urgent and important matters of the globe have been solved, money on space exploration is meaningless. It at all to invest millions of dollars researching and producing foods for astronauts (for space exploration purpose), while every day thousands of people are starving. Furthermore, the discovery of outer space only serves a minor group of people if the majority well-educated. do no even know how to prevent common threatening diseases such as AIDS and lung cancer.Then, some may argue that the purpose of space exploration to discover new lands, new energy resources or to deter potential threat to . Nevertheless, is it effective to do so while other alternatives are available? yet effectively used. New energy resources (e.g. solar and nuclear energy) have not yet been widely-used. Threats of plagues have not yet been deterred. All of these tasks that haven’t been tackled yet require money. That is why costly space discovery programs are a waste of resources.In a nutshell, people should only invest in space exploration provided that urgent and important matters mentioned earlier in this essay have been solved. Also, purposes of space exploration campaigns should be studied carefully and other alternatives should be considered before the money is wasted.;The notion that spending money on space exploration is a complete waste has been a topic of debate for decades. With numerous problems plaguing our world, such as poverty, hunger, and disease, it is understandable that some may view space exploration as a frivolous expenditure. However, the benefits of space exploration far outweigh the costs, and investing in this field can have a significant impact on our daily lives.Firstly, space exploration has led to numerous technological advancements that have improved our daily lives. For instance, memory foam, water purification systems, and GPS technology were all developed as a result of space research. These innovations have not only enhanced our quality of life but have also created new industries and job opportunities. Furthermore, space exploration has also led to a greater understanding of our planet and the universe, which can help us address some of the world's most pressing issues, such as climate change and natural disasters.Moreover, investing in space exploration can also have long-term benefits for humanity. As our planet faces numerous challenges, such as overpopulation and resource depletion, space exploration can provide a potential solution. By exploring and potentially colonizing other planets, we can ensure the survival of humanity and create new opportunities for growth and development. Additionally, space exploration can also foster international cooperation and diplomacy, as nations work together to achieve common goals in space.In conclusion, while it is true that there are many problems that need to be addressed on our planet, the benefits of space exploration make it a worthwhile investment. Rather than viewing space exploration as a waste of money, we should see it as a vital component of our quest for knowledge, innovation, and progress. By continuing to invest in space exploration, we can drive technological advancements, address global challenges, and ensure a brighter future for humanity.
1312;With the increase in computer use, many people feel that schools do not need to put the emphasis that they used to on basic handwriting skills or mental mathematics skills.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;In recent years, computer use around the world has increased drastically. As a result technological equipment is used increasingly in schools around the world. Many people question therefore whether schools should put much emphasis on teaching students basic handwriting skills and mental mathematics skills.The use of technological equipment in lessons has increased since the onset of the digital age. Nearly all professions around the world involve computer use and even the simplest tasks are carried out via electronic equipment. Hence, it is important for students to learn how to use technology correctly for their future careers. Electronic devices also offer various learning advantages, as notes and assignments can be completed much faster and more neatly using these tools.Nonetheless, the practical skills such as using and holding a pen correctly are likewise vital for future careers. For that reason, students have to be taught at early ages how to carry out simple tasks using basic skills, such as writing. It is also essential that a student develops neat handwriting, as in the case of a technological problem the student will have to write by hand. Furthermore, final exams are typically written by hand and thus the student must develop the basic skill of holding a pen and writing with it. Mathematics skills are no different. People will not always have a device with them to carry out calculations and the ability to do arithmetic in the head is a vital skill for operating in today’s world.In conclusion, I personally believe that schools should keep a balance between using practical skills and using electronic equipment to carry out certain tasks by having student submit assignments created electronically, yet also by having them complete assignments by hand in class and without computers or calculators. This balance is important, as if the focus lies only on one of the two aspects, the student will face problems later on in life.;The increasing prevalence of computers in our daily lives has sparked a debate about the importance of traditional skills such as handwriting and mental mathematics in schools. While some argue that these skills are no longer essential, I partially disagree with this notion. In my opinion, the value of handwriting and mental mathematics skills extends beyond their practical applications in a computer-dominated world.Firstly, handwriting is an essential skill that enhances cognitive development, particularly in children. Research has shown that writing by hand improves memory, language skills, and creativity. For instance, studies have found that students who take notes by hand tend to perform better in exams than those who use laptops. This is because handwriting engages the brain more actively, allowing for better retention and understanding of information. Moreover, handwriting is a unique form of self-expression and can be a therapeutic outlet for individuals, promoting mental well-being and emotional intelligence.On the other hand, mental mathematics skills are also crucial in everyday life, even with the widespread use of calculators and computers. Being able to perform basic arithmetic operations mentally, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, helps individuals to make quick calculations and estimates, which is vital in real-life situations. For example, when shopping, people need to be able to calculate the total cost of items, including taxes and discounts, to make informed purchasing decisions. Furthermore, mental mathematics skills promote problem-solving abilities, logical thinking, and analytical reasoning, which are highly valued in many professions.In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly changed the way we live and work, I believe that basic handwriting and mental mathematics skills remain essential for cognitive development, self-expression, and practical applications. Schools should continue to emphasize these skills to equip students with a strong foundation for future success, regardless of the increasing reliance on technology. By striking a balance between traditional skills and computer literacy, we can ensure that future generations are well-rounded, adaptable, and proficient in a rapidly changing world.
1303;With the scale of globalisation today, it would be of unquestioned benefit to have a single world currency.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Globalisation has become a significant aspect of the world’s modern economy, with countless industries and businesses expanding in various countries. This has led to the debate of developing a world currency with many people believing it could drastically help further develop economies and assist in the development of many countries.A worldwide currency could bring on effects similar to when Euro was developed for Europe. Trade could be significantly encouraged, as there would be no exchange rate fluctuation risks between different currencies. Moreover, tourists would not need to exchange money when travelling.However, there are certain risks to a global currency, which definitely do not make it an “unquestioned benefit”. Countries in debt would not be able to lower their currency value to make consumer goods more desirable, which could develop into a severe economic issue. For example, the US regulated its interest rates to increase the money resources in order to diminish the effect of a recent recession. Also economic problems, such as in Greece, have actually been made worse by the use of the common Euro. If applied worldwide, many countries’ economies could be very similarly negatively impacted. Finally, many countries around the world do not have a stable enough economy to be able to enter a common currency. If weaker countries were to adopt a world currency, this could be disastrous to their economy and to the economies of other countries using the same currency.In conclusion, the extent to which a global currency would be beneficial is quite low. It seems to me that the risks outweigh the benefits, as if a country were to lose economic stability, the world would be impacted as well. For that reason, I feel that in present circumstances, it is best to have separate currencies to protect countries from economic recession.;The notion of having a single world currency has garnered significant attention in recent years, particularly with the increasing scale of globalization. While it may seem like a convenient and efficient solution to facilitate international trade and commerce, I partially disagree with the idea that it would be of unquestioned benefit.On the one hand, a single world currency would indeed simplify international transactions, eliminate exchange rate risks, and reduce transaction costs. This could lead to increased trade, investment, and economic growth. For instance, the Euro, a single currency used by 19 of the 27 member states of the European Union, has facilitated economic integration and trade within the region. A single world currency could have a similar impact on a global scale.On the other hand, a single world currency would also mean a loss of monetary sovereignty for individual countries. National governments would no longer be able to implement independent monetary policies, which could hinder their ability to respond to domestic economic conditions. For example, the European Central Bank's monetary policy has been criticized for being too focused on the needs of larger economies, such as Germany, while neglecting the needs of smaller economies, such as Greece. A single world currency could exacerbate such issues on a global scale.Furthermore, the introduction of a single world currency would require a high degree of international cooperation, which is often difficult to achieve. The complexity of implementing such a system, as well as the potential for political and economic tensions, should not be underestimated. In conclusion, while a single world currency has some potential benefits, its implementation would require careful consideration of the potential drawbacks and challenges. Therefore, I believe that the benefits of a single world currency are not entirely unquestioned, and a more nuanced approach to international monetary policy is needed.
1295;With the vast increase in online resources today, libraries with print books are not a necessity for today’s society.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is indeed true that digital resources today far outstrip what can be put and stored in print books. Almost any kind of book can now be accessed digitally and those that can’t be will soon be changed to a digital format. Some people, therefore, believe that libraries with print books are no longer needed.If one looks at this issue dispassionately, it seems far more logical that people now should only read books digitally. It only requires a single computer or electronic reader and an individual can have access to the history of literature and works on all other fields. The costs involved with setting, typing, printing and distributing print books would practically disappear and this would make things more convenient and much cheaper. An actual library building would be totally unnecessary, as all one would need would be a ‘virtual library’ as a website and all works could be accessed through this portal. There would not even be any need to leave the house to gain access to anything one needed. This would seem to be the most logical way of proceeding.Logic, however, is not always the best approach to everything. Print books have a long history with humanity and our relationship with real books is not something that can be changed overnight. Many people, including younger readers, feel that there is something special about having a book with real paper and needing to turn pages. There will therefore for the time being be a future for print books and libraries.Libraries will continue to be especially important, as not all older people use computers and e-readers as much as the younger generation. They will still want to read print books and the library is a cheap and convenient place to find them. In addition, if only a few books in print are available in the future, libraries might be one of the few places where they might be accessed. Another purpose that libraries serve is acting as community centres that organise events, education and childcare. Ironically, libraries also provide computers and Internet access for people who cannot afford their own.In spite of the seeming dominance to come of digital books, I feel that there is and will be a place for libraries with print books. This state of affairs might change in the future, but at present, they are important community resources.;I partially disagree with the statement that libraries with print books are not a necessity for today's society. While it is true that the internet has made a vast amount of information available online, print books and libraries still have a significant role to play.Firstly, libraries offer a unique learning environment that fosters a love for reading and learning in people of all ages. The tactile experience of holding a book, flipping through its pages, and discovering new authors and topics is unparalleled. Moreover, libraries provide a quiet and peaceful space for studying, researching, and concentrating, which is often lacking in homes or online environments.Secondly, not all information is available online, and even if it is, it may not be reliable or accurate. Print books, on the other hand, are often thoroughly researched and edited, providing a trustworthy source of information. Additionally, many classic works of literature, historical documents, and academic journals are only available in print form, making libraries an indispensable resource for researchers and scholars.Lastly, libraries play a vital role in promoting literacy, education, and social inclusion in communities. They offer free access to books, educational programs, and other resources, making them an essential institution for underprivileged and marginalized groups. For instance, many libraries provide literacy programs for children, language classes for immigrants, and job training resources for the unemployed.In conclusion, while online resources have certainly increased access to information, libraries with print books still have a crucial function in today's society. They provide a unique learning environment, trustworthy sources of information, and promote social inclusion and education. As such, I believe that libraries will continue to be a necessity, complementing online resources and providing a valuable service to communities.
1392;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Capital punishment is always associated with ignorance and intolerance. In fact, we must acknowledge that some people disagree with this kind of penalty, but others vote in its favor. Portugal was the first European country to end this kind of penalty. Since the 19th century, tolerance and respect for life important values. Moreover, we can affirm that remains under the same codes. Maybe because of a religious view point, the respect for life is a typical value in the Old Catholic world.Those who are in favor of capital punishment mostly live in developing countries. However, this is not just an image of the Third World countries. Actually, the USA is one country where this kind of punishment has its rates of application. The state of Texas, in particular, is at the top, supporting this measure against crime, especially those involving serial killers and crimes against children. In a society dominated by fear and government control, it is foreseen that this penalty will continue .Maybe this is not a simple question. As we can see there are several values here and of course cultural behavior. The roots of the question are religious, cultural, ethical and even geographical. The world is divided and the law systems show this division. The solutions, however can lead us to other questions concerning revenge and justice. better to kill a person because of his crimes? Can we admit that a life sentence could be a much better sentence? In fact, rehabilitation is the right way especially with an accurate psychological evaluation first. Some people are lost forever, and in my opinion some murderers and other criminals will suffer more in jail. In this sense, capital punishment is an easy way out.;The notion that capital punishment is essential to control violence in society has been a topic of debate for centuries. While some argue that the death penalty is necessary to maintain law and order, others claim that it has little to no impact on reducing crimes of violence. In my opinion, I disagree with the statement that without capital punishment, our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase.Firstly, research has shown that there is no conclusive evidence to prove that capital punishment acts as a deterrent to violent crimes. In fact, many countries that have abolished the death penalty have seen a decline in violent crimes. For instance, Canada, which abolished the death penalty in 1976, has seen a steady decline in homicide rates since then. This suggests that other factors such as socio-economic conditions, education, and law enforcement play a more significant role in controlling violence.Secondly, the death penalty is often seen as a cruel and inhumane practice that goes against human rights. The risk of executing an innocent person is also a major concern, as errors in the justice system can lead to wrongful convictions. Furthermore, capital punishment can also perpetuate a cycle of violence, rather than breaking it. By taking a life, the state is essentially perpetuating the same kind of violence it seeks to prevent.In conclusion, while the intention of capital punishment may be to control violence in society, I believe that its effectiveness is overstated. Instead, governments should focus on addressing the root causes of violence, such as poverty, unemployment, and lack of education. By doing so, we can create a safer and more secure society without resorting to the death penalty.
1430;Without capital punishment our lives are less secure and crimes or violence increase. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Serious crimes need capital punishment so that the are unable to get involved in the crime in the future. However, they want to stop the acts of violation in the future then it would be better to .Overall, I agree with the fact that punishment is the way to avoid the and hence our lives become more secure.

Although by this way, some bad may become effective of the society but some do not bring themselves to the right path because they are . The person that involved in the crime and never to stop the law-breaking act should be punished in extremely serious way. However, it totally depends on the nature of crime. Some to a capital punishment and some may require a small penalty. The law-making institutions are responsible to bring the bad man to the right level of punishment that he deserves. If there is weak legislation to properly handle the offender, it may for the good . The government should be the responsible authority to provide a secure and better state to live. Laws should be implemented and executed in the most proper way that not allow the offender to commit violent acts or to break the law in any way and to any extent. To sum up, it is the responsibility of the state to stop people involved in crime. It may be done through solving the problems of the people that led them to commit that act or by the punishment accordingly.Where are the paragraphs? This is a good essay; however there are many small mistakes that might cost you dearly. There are also several unclear expressions and grammatical errors.";The statement that without capital punishment, our lives are less secure and crimes or violence increase, is a contentious issue that has sparked intense debate. While some argue that capital punishment serves as a deterrent to crime, others contend that it is not an effective means of reducing criminal activity. In my opinion, I partially disagree with the statement.On one hand, the existence of capital punishment may indeed create a sense of fear among potential offenders, which could lead to a decrease in the number of violent crimes committed. The threat of the ultimate penalty may make individuals think twice before engaging in serious criminal activity. Additionally, the removal of dangerous individuals from society through capital punishment may also contribute to a safer environment.On the other hand, numerous studies have shown that the implementation of capital punishment does not necessarily lead to a reduction in crime rates. In fact, some countries that have abolished capital punishment have seen a decrease in crime rates, suggesting that other factors such as socioeconomic conditions, education, and law enforcement play a more significant role in determining crime rates. Furthermore, the possibility of wrongful convictions and executions highlights the inherent flaws in the justice system, which can lead to the loss of innocent lives.In conclusion, while capital punishment may have some deterrent effect, it is not the sole solution to reducing crime and increasing security. A more comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes of crime, such as poverty, lack of education, and social inequality, is necessary to create a safer society. Therefore, I disagree with the statement to a large extent, as capital punishment is not the primary factor in determining the security of our lives and the rate of violent crimes.
163;Write about the following topic.Although there are a lot of translation software available, learning a language could still be advantageous. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people claim that language knowledge has still benefited inspite of appearance of applications and websites providing translation in real time. Modern special software is able to give quite quality translation into different languages, and it seems that it will soon replace the translators and will get rid of necessity to learn new languages. However, in my opinion, there are still some essential advantages to know foreign languages.First of all, any language is so complicated and constantly changing system that it is impossible to automized translation process to keep all senses. For instance, if you interlocutor creates a joke based on words game, it will unlikely recognise by AI. Thus, it is too hard to teach a computer to uderstand all meanings that you want to provide.Another important aspect of learning languages is knowing new cultures. Language is the great source for understanding other nations and countries. If you use online translator, you will never know the origine of some idioms or phrases that contain culture code.Moreover, learning new language is a tool of training your brain. It helps to develop memory and imagination. For instance, people didn't refuse studying maths after calculation device had been invented, because it is still important to understand how it works and it is necessary for developing other sciences.Finally, there is a lot of places and occasions when you do not have internet access. Then online translators are not available. But if you need help or ask a path being abroad, it is better to know at least some phrases. Otherwise, you can occur in unpleasant situation.To sum up, I definitely agree the statement that learning languages is essential in spite of techology progress. Although artificial intelligence is able to translate everything you want, it is crucial to continue learning languages in order to understand all sense and meanings in conversation with foreigners, to know new cultures and understand their peculiarities and, of course, to make your brain work.;The advent of translation software has undoubtedly made communication across languages more accessible. However, it is still beneficial to learn a language. I strongly agree with this statement as acquiring a language has numerous advantages that go beyond mere translation.Firstly, learning a language enables individuals to understand the nuances and cultural context of communication, which is often lost in translation. For instance, when interacting with native speakers, being able to comprehend idioms,phrases and expressions can make a significant difference in building relationships and avoiding misunderstandings. This is particularly important in professional settings, such as business or diplomacy, where subtleties in language can greatly impact outcomes.Moreover, language acquisition enhances cognitive abilities, including memory, problem-solving, and multitasking. Research has shown that bilingual individuals exhibit improved executive functions and delayed onset of age-related cognitive decline. In addition, learning a language can broaden one's perspective and worldview, fostering empathy and tolerance.Furthermore, while translation software can facilitate basic communication, it often struggles with complex or specialized texts, such as technical, literary, or poetic works. For example, translating a novel or a technical manual requires a deep understanding of the language, its nuances, and cultural references, which can only be fully grasped by a human learner.In conclusion, although translation software has its uses, learning a language still offers a wide range of benefits, from improved cognitive abilities to enhanced cultural understanding and professional opportunities. As technology continues to evolve, the value of language acquisition will only continue to grow, making it an essential skill for individuals seeking to engage with the global community.

Why are more people choosing to have operation to change the way they look? Do you think this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;A greater number of individuals opted for plastic surgery to enhance the physical outlook. What could be the reason behind the increasing number of people opting for cosmetic surgery to deter their appearance.In my opinion the main reason why cosmetic surgery is in demand nowadays is because society has set a certain standard that physical appearance will be the fastest ticket to stand out in the crowd. Second is it boosts confidence to people with low self esteem.The favorable outcome is not as much the adverse effect to the individuals. Example, the fastest way to reduce wrinkles on the face is to get Botox treatment. It lasts 3-4 months, after that it needs continuous medication to maintain what has been changed. It takes a lot of money to satisfy the demands of the society. On top of that repetition of pain and recovery during and after the surgery.There are numerous natural ways to enhance beauty and confidence. Contentment, exercise and a healthy lifestyle are effective methods to maintain the genuine beauty of the people. Simple walking in the morning, keeping the distance from negativity and eating vegetables and fruits are the simplest methods that boost the natural glow of the body and prevent us from being sick.To conclude the essay, I think plastic surgery is not necessary to enhance physical outlook as it uses synthetic components that have harmful effects within the body.;"The rise in popularity of cosmetic surgery has led to an increasing number of people opting for operations to enhance their physical appearance. One of the primary reasons for this trend is the growing influence of social media, which creates unrealistic beauty standards and promotes the idea of a ""perfect"" body. People, especially young individuals, feel pressured to conform to these ideals, and cosmetic surgery seems like a viable solution. Additionally, the advancement in medical technology has made these procedures safer and more accessible, resulting in a higher demand.Another factor contributing to this phenomenon is the desire for self-improvement and confidence boosting. Many individuals believe that altering their appearance will enhance their self-esteem and overall quality of life. For instance, some people may choose to undergo surgery to correct physical flaws that have affected their mental health, such as facial deformities or scarring. In these cases, cosmetic surgery can have a profoundly positive impact on a person's well-being.However, I believe that the increasing popularity of cosmetic surgery is largely a negative development. The beauty standards perpetuated by the media are often unattainable and unhealthy, leading to a culture of dissatisfaction with one's natural appearance. Furthermore, the risks and complications associated with cosmetic surgery can be severe, and the long-term effects on mental health are not yet fully understood. Ultimately, the emphasis on physical appearance can detract from more meaningful aspects of a person's character and identity. In conclusion, while cosmetic surgery may have its benefits, the growing trend towards altering one's appearance is a concerning development that reflects societal pressures and unattainable beauty standards."

What solutions can you suggest?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Most children are facing one form of bullying or the other in our schools on daily basis world wide. It is becoming a serious problem and there is a need to solve this. In this essay, we would be considering two causes and possible ways to solve these.First of all, the rate at which children bullying each other in the school environment is rising. One major cause is that bullying breeds bullying, children who are faced with physical, mental and emotional abuse from homes tend to transfer their fustrations on their peers. They think that is how one is supposed to live, exacting authority to gain superiority on weaker peers in school. Another is children who has low self esteem, such students feels threatened over their classmates they taught to be more intelligent or having better physical appearance than them.Although, there are several causes of bullying, teachers should be taught how to identify children who are from abusive homes and inform the appropriate authority. These students would taken away from such toxic environment early and they would be sent for some pschological therapy. Meanwhile, education is also a key factor especially for children who have low self esteem. This should be done by forms such as role plays, presentation and drama, where these students are taught how to have self love and accepting what they can not change on their self.In conclusion, children from abusive homes and those who have low self esteem are some of the reasons for bullying. I recommend that early identification of abusive children and education is some of the ways we can solve these problems.;Bullying is a pervasive and persistent issue in many schools worldwide, posing significant threats to the emotional and psychological well-being of students. The causes of bullying are complex and multifaceted, stemming from a combination of individual, social, and environmental factors. One primary cause is the desire for power and control, which some students exert over their peers through intimidation and aggression. Social media also plays a significant role, as it provides a platform for bullying to occur anonymously and extensively, making it difficult for victims to escape.Furthermore, societal norms and pressures can contribute to bullying behaviors. For instance, in environments where competitiveness and aggression are highly valued, students may feel compelled to assert dominance over others. Lack of effective supervision and intervention from school authorities can also embolden bullies, as they may feel they can act with impunity.To address this issue, several solutions can be implemented. Firstly, schools should establish and enforce strict anti-bullying policies, ensuring that all forms of bullying are recognized and addressed. This includes training teachers and staff to identify and intervene in bullying situations effectively. Additionally, promoting empathy and respect through educational programs can help foster a more inclusive and supportive school culture. Encouraging open communication between students, teachers, and parents is also crucial, allowing victims to feel safe reporting incidents without fear of retaliation.From personal experience, I have seen the positive impact of peer support groups and counseling services in schools. These initiatives not only provide victims with a safe space to share their experiences but also offer bullies a chance to understand the harm they cause and change their behavior. By addressing the root causes of bullying and implementing these solutions, we can work towards creating safer, more supportive learning environments for all students.

With the advent of e-commerce, the convenience and accessibility of buying things on the internet have made it an increasingly popular choice. In my opinion, the advantages of shopping online far outweigh the disadvantages.One of the primary benefits of online shopping is the convenience it offers. With just a few clicks, consumers can browse and purchase products from the comfort of their own homes, 24 hours a day. This is particularly beneficial for those with busy schedules or living in remote areas with limited access to physical stores. Additionally, online shopping allows for comparison of prices and products across different websites, enabling consumers to make informed decisions and find the best deals.Another significant advantage is the wide range of products available online, often exceeding what is available in physical stores. For instance, online bookstores like Amazon offer an vast selection of books, including rare and hard-to-find titles. Furthermore, online shopping reduces the need for physical travel, saving time, money, and reducing carbon emissions.However, some may argue that online shopping lacks the personal touch and immediacy of physical stores. Nevertheless, many online retailers have implemented efficient customer service systems, allowing for easy returns, refunds, and queries. In my experience, online shopping has been a seamless and efficient process, with many retailers offering reliable delivery and competitive pricing.In conclusion, the advantages of shopping online, including convenience, accessibility, and a wide range of products, outweigh the disadvantages. As technology continues to advance and online retailers improve their services, it is likely that online shopping will become an even more dominant force in the retail industry.

For example, it is commonly said that people act differently when they are at home and when they are outside. People instinctively tend to be more relaxed and off-guard when at home, whereas in social situations they usually make an effort, even if unconsciously, to be more likable and to conceal the less agreeable aspects of their personality from others, even their partners. Because of this, it is usual to hear that one does not truly know someone until one has lived with that person.In extreme cases, cohabitation before marriage could even prevent couples from entering into a marriage that is bound to fail and will lead to unhappiness. Considering this possibility seems reasonable, as marriage is not only an emotional bond, but also a legal one, and undoing it is usually upsetting, time-consuming and costly.Another reason I find cohabitation before marriage to be a sensible choice is that, as minor disagreements and conflicts are usually inevitable during the first months of cohabitation, it is preferable to pass through that stage before getting married than to add such problems to a period which in itself can already be stressful, such as the few weeks before the ceremony and the weeks following.What I have said up to this point reflects my opinion, but it must be noted I did not put any of it into practice when I got married. Indeed, my wife and I decided to move in together only a few weeks before the ceremony. This decision was due to the fact that her family is quite old-fashioned, and moving in together before would undoubtedly have caused them pain, even if we had our reasons for doing so and they would have understood them. No degree of persuasion would have avoided or removed such pain. We found the long-term benefits of a stable and close relationship with her family to be more important than the discomfort of not moving in together, and we ultimately decided to do it only once the ceremony was planned.;The notion that cohabitation provides significant benefits for young couples has gained considerable attention in recent years. I strongly agree with this opinion, as living together before marriage can indeed foster a deeper understanding between partners. By sharing a living space, cohabiting couples can gain valuable insights into each other's daily habits, habits, and lifestyle choices, thereby facilitating a more informed decision about their compatibility.One of the primary advantages of cohabitation is that it allows couples to test their relationship in a real-world setting. For instance, they can learn how to manage their finances, divide household chores, and navigate conflicts in a more realistic and intimate environment. This, can help them identify potential issues and work through them together, ultimately strengthening their bond. Furthermore, cohabitation provides an opportunity for couples to assess their long-term compatibility, reducing the risk of divorce or marital dissatisfaction down the line.Moreover, cohabitation can also promote emotional maturity and independence. By living together, young couples can develop essential life skills, such as communication, compromise, and conflict resolution. These skills are vital for a healthy and successful marriage, and cohabitation provides a platform for couples to hone them in a supportive and loving environment. For example, a friend of mine who cohabited with her partner before getting married reported that the experience helped her develop a greater appreciation for the importance of communication and teamwork in a relationship.In conclusion, I firmly believe that cohabitation can bring numerous advantages for young people, enabling them to gain a deeper understanding of each other before making a lifelong commitment. By providing a platform for testing compatibility, promoting emotional maturity, and fostering essential life skills, cohabitation can lay the foundation for a strong and fulfilling marriage.
499;Write about the following topic.Consumers are faced with increasing numbers of advertisements from competing companies. To what extent do you think consumers are influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;These days, consumers often suffer from the increase of numbers of advertisements conducted by competing companies. I believe that this fact has certain negative effects on consumers' working performance as well as their private space and time. In order to protect consumers, some proposals related to protecting their information and eliminating the number of advertisements are required.The increasing number of advertisements has a negative effect on the consumers. Firstly, their working perfomance can be reduced. Obivously, when a person is working, he cannot receive a large number of advertisements, process and response them. I know a researcher who receives a lot of advertising emails from certain banksand even some scientific journal while he require time to perform many research projects. This makes him feel uncomfortable when working, thereby reducing the research's quality. Secondly, the advertisements can affect on people private space and time. For examle, when they spend time on their family after a hard working day, or even when they are sleeping. This completyly affects on the consumers, in terms of both physical and mental health.For protecting consumers, certain methods need to be proposed. Firstly, it can be implied that the consumers' information is illegal used by many companies. Therefore, an imporvement of security method can allow us to protect consumers. Secondly, eliminating the number of advertisements performed by companies and eliminating the hours for companies send advertisements are required.In conclusion, the increasing numbers of advertisements leads to certain unwanted results for consumers, such as reducing their working performance as well as their private space and time. For protecting consumers, we need to protect their personal information and eliminate the number of advertisements.;The proliferation of advertisements in today's market has become a ubiquitous phenomenon, with consumers being bombarded by competing companies vying for their attention. In my opinion, the extent to which consumers are influenced by advertisements is significant. Advertisements have the power to shape consumer perceptions, influence purchasing decisions, and even create new needs. For instance, a well-crafted advertisement can create an emotional connection with the consumer, making them more likely to choose a particular brand over another.Moreover, advertisements often employ subtle persuasion techniques, such as subliminal messaging and celebrity endorsements, which can be particularly effective in influencing consumer behavior. However, this influence can also be detrimental, as consumers may be misled by deceptive or misleading advertisements, leading to poor purchasing decisions. To protect consumers, measures such as stringent advertising regulations and fact-checking can be implemented. For example, regulatory bodies can enforce truth-in-advertising laws, ensuring that advertisements are honest and transparent.Additionally, consumers can be educated on how to critically evaluate advertisements, recognizing tactics such as emotional appeals and bandwagon effects. This can be achieved through public awareness campaigns and media literacy programs. Ultimately, it is essential to strike a balance between the commercial interests of companies and the rights of consumers. By implementing these measures, consumers can be safeguarded against manipulative advertising practices, and make informed decisions that reflect their genuine needs and preferences. By being aware of the potential influence of advertisements, consumers can navigate the market with greater discernment, and companies can be encouraged to adopt more responsible and transparent advertising practices.

Some people think that the closure of local business will bring about the death of local communities.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;As the huge company extends their bussiness, the local markets is dimmished to local society. This essay explains why I disagree closure of local business will bring about the death of local communities with relevant examples.First, Big company drag the new residents. I believe major company make the local communities to flourish. My cusion lived in countryside for 30 years. Every time when I visited that place, that farm land still same during the a few decades. However, recently when I dropped by there I surprised with new tall building that newly built. My cusion told me once the big supermarkert open in this neighborhood, grasp many couples or familly to live here. Eventually, that rural place's population is surged.Someone thought giant grocery's product cheap price can not compete with local product, that make local place to close. I considered it is anachromism idea. Now the customer's purchasing value is totally diffrent with previous eras. Buyer start choose organic product and eco-friendlly or morality brand. If local stores have their own unique products, which are not replace with other, such as handmade cheese and unique taste of bread, local bussiness can compete with global chain markets.In conclusion, albeit famous company expands their sites every moments, the local community can be larger by new residents settled down near local region. Also, local bussiness have specialty, community can not dismissed;The proliferation of supermarkets in various countries has led to the decline of small, local businesses, sparking concerns about the potential demise of local communities. I agree to a large extent that the closure of local businesses can have a detrimental impact on the vitality of local communities.Small, local businesses are often the backbone of a community, providing unique products and services that reflect the local culture and character. They also tend to keep money within the community, as profits are reinvested locally, rather than being siphoned off to distant corporate headquarters. In contrast, supermarkets often prioritize efficiency and low prices over community engagement, which can lead to a homogenization of local identity. For instance, in many towns, the arrival of a supermarket has led to the closure of family-owned bakeries, butchers, and greengrocers, resulting in a loss of diversity and charm.Furthermore, local businesses often provide a sense of community and social cohesion, as they are typically owned and operated by locals who are invested in the area's well-being. The closure of these businesses can lead to a decline in community spirit, as well as a reduction in local employment opportunities. For example, in my hometown, the closure of a local bookstore led to a significant decrease in foot traffic and a sense of emptiness in the town center.However, it is worth noting that some supermarkets have made efforts to support local suppliers and engage with the community, which can help mitigate the negative impacts. Nevertheless, I believe that the loss of local businesses can have a profound impact on the character and cohesion of local communities, and efforts should be made to support and preserve these unique and vital components of our social fabric.
1045;Write about the following topic.Extreme sports such as sky diving and skiing are very dangerous and should be banned.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Nowadays, practicing extreme sports like sky diving and skiing is much more popular than in the past. Anyway, a lot of people think that this types of sports are very dangerous and should be banned. This essay will talk about extreme sports giving my own opinion about the idea of banning this activities because of their risks.Practicing a sport is very important for the general health of a person; a lot of people choose to practice dangerous sports, like skiing, because of the adrenaline and the sensation that it brings to you. Sports of this type can help you to go over your fear and they will help you to see life from a different perspective.Anyway, the risks that an athlete will go through are many; every year the amount of people that have injuries or, sometimes die, because of this types of activities are numerous. Especially with skiing, a person should never go alone in places that don't have the right equipment to guarantee a safe experience; many times when practicing this types of sports, athletes from all over the world decide to go over their limit going to practice in zones that are known to be dangerous or unsafe and, in this cases, the possibility of something bad to happen is high.Personally, I think that when you want to practice or experiment a sport that is extreme you should take all the right prevention to make the experience as safe as possible to avoid any injuries. Practicing sports is important but it is also fundamental to try your best to avoid injuries when practicing it. This essay talked about extreme sports and their risk, giving my own opinion at the end.";I strongly disagree with the view that extreme sports such as sky diving and skiing should be banned due to their perceived danger. While it is true that these sports carry a level of risk, it is also the case that many participants take necessary precautions and undergo rigorous training to minimize the likelihood of accidents.One of the primary reasons extreme sports should not be banned is that they provide a sense of adventure and thrill that many people crave. Sky diving, for instance, allows individuals to experience the rush of free-falling from a great height, while skiing enables people to navigate challenging slopes and enjoy breathtaking scenery. These activities not only promote physical fitness but also mental well-being, as participants develop resilience, and a sense of accomplishment.Furthermore, many extreme sports have robust safety protocols in place. For example, sky diving centers typically require jumpers to undergo thorough training and equipment checks before each jump, while ski resorts often have well-marked trails, safety patrols, and emergency response plans. These measures significantly reduce the risk of injury, making it possible for people to enjoy these sports with relative safety.It's also worth noting that banning extreme sports would be an overreach of authority, as it would infringe upon individuals' freedom to choose their recreational activities. Many people engage in these sports responsibly and with full awareness of the potential risks. Instead of banning these sports, it would be more effective to promote safety awareness and best practices among participants.In conclusion, while extreme sports do carry some level of danger, the benefits they provide, both physically and mentally, along with the implementation of strict safety measures, outweigh the risks. Therefore, these sports should not be banned but rather, continued to be enjoyed by those who appreciate the thrill and adventure they offer.
479;Write about the following topic.Few people devote time to hobbies nowadays. Say why you think this is the case and what effect this has on the individual and society in general.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Hobbies are recreational activities that are pursued away from one's school or work. They are meant to be an escape from the mundane and a way of keeping people sane and happy. Unfortunately, they have become almost a luxury in today's fast-paced world.Several reasons can account for this massive decrease in the pursuit of hobbies. One such reason is the fact that hobbies require time and money which are two very dear resources in today's world. Social sophistication and technological advancements have brought about changes in hobbies. What used to be called hobbies in the past are now considered obsolete and the new ones, including video games and virtual reality require financial commitment in their pursuit. Even if one has the money to pursue such, he or she would have to set aside time in his or her busy schedule to enjoy those hobbies. It is therefore no wonder that most people found to pursue hobbies today are either wealthy youth or comfortable pensioners.Secondly, lack of interest may be an important factor why people devote little to no time to hobbies. Most of the educated lot are taught from a tender age only to concentrate on their studies in order to secure a comfortable future for themselves. Such children are discouraged from enjoying anything away from anything extracurricular and therefore grow into hobby-less adults who work all day and do nothing else otherwise. This is seen in a lot of Ghanaian homes where doing anything other than studying after school is deemed a taboo. Consequently, many grow into adults with little humour or mirth.Moreover, many people get exhausted with school or work, which have become extremely intensive nowadays, as compared to the more laid back past. After a tiring day, most people like to crawl into their beds to catch a night-long rest only to return to their busy life the next day.This lack of hobby pursuit, though understandable, does the individual and society more harm than good. Many individuals today are being treated for one mental health or another. Hobbies are a good way to relax and destress through leisure and can go a long way to improve mental health. Its absence will only wreak havoc for the society, which will only consist of tired and apathetic individuals who could not care less about each other and their surroundings.In conclusion, it is important, albeit difficult, to pay attention to hobbies in order to improve the health and psyche of the individual and society as a whole. More effort should be geared at encouraging hobbies at school and at the work place.;The notion that few people devote time to hobbies nowadays is a stark reality. In my opinion, this is largely due to the demanding nature of modern life, which leaves individuals with limited time and energy for leisure activities. The pressures of work, family, and social commitments have led to a significant decline in hobby pursuits. Many people are now consumed by the demands of their professional lives, leaving them exhausted and with little time for personal interests.As a result, individuals are missing out on the numerous benefits that hobbies provide, such as stress relief, creativity, and social connections. Without hobbies, people can become stagnant and unfulfilled, leading to a negative impact on their mental and physical health. Furthermore, the lack of hobbies can also lead to a decline in innovation and creativity, as individuals are not engaging in activities that stimulate their minds and foster new ideas.Society as a whole also suffers from the decline of hobby pursuit. Hobbies often bring people together, creating communities and fostering social bonds. Without these shared interests, communities can become fragmented and disconnected. Additionally, the decline of hobbies can also lead to a loss of cultural heritage and traditional skills, as fewer people are engaging in activities that preserve and pass on cultural knowledge.For instance, I have seen many friends who used to play musical instruments or paint in their free time, but have since stopped due to work commitments. This not only affects their personal well-being but also the cultural scene, as fewer people are contributing to the arts. In conclusion, the decline of hobby pursuit is a concerning trend that has significant effects on both the individual and society. It is essential that people prioritize their personal interests and make time for hobbies, in order to maintain a healthy work-life balance and contribute to the richness and diversity of our communities.

Personally, I think there are some good advantages team activities cause our life,and especially in business scenes more comfortable and productive.Initially, only one person's work is limited, compared with group activities. This means that working only one person will be able to cause some profits to some extent. On the other hand, group working will be more productive and efficient to make more sales figures. In addition, each person has a great ability. For example, some people have great communication skills and negotiations. Those people arethe most appropriate roles for sales. Furthermore, some people are good at analysing the group performance quality and making strategies. Those who are good at these activities are best for marketing team. As a result, they can focus on their strong points for work and they can divide and conquer the tasks with each other.Of course, some people are eager to work alone at their own relaxed pace and make a profit to some extent. This is less stressful they do not need to keep attention from other colleagues. But this means that they need to decide all tasks and take all responsibility. Sometimes it might be risky once they made a mistake and caused a huge deficit.Finally, there is no doubt that more than two heads are better than one. People can share their experiences and opinion to improve their group activities. If some people who are sensitive and feel pressure if some people meddle in too much. It is necessary to organize some rules that must be effective. For example, all people need to try to stay positive, avoid stating negative or swear words, and not deny one person's opinion straightforwardly and emotionally. Making a great atmosphere, saying positive words with each other, and including some humor, will lead to everyone's performance being more productive.;I strongly agree that group or team activities can teach more important skills for life than those activities which are done alone. Through participating in team-based projects and activities, I have gained invaluable skills that are essential for success in personal and professional life.One of the most significant skills that team activities teach is communication. When working in a team, each member has to effectively convey their ideas, express opinions, and listen to others. This fosters open dialogue, collaboration, and conflict resolution, all of which are crucial life skills. For instance, in a group project at university, I had to work with my teammates to complete a marketing plan. We had to communicate our ideas, negotiate, and compromise to achieve a common goal. This experience taught me the importance of clear and respectful communication, a skill that I now apply in all aspects of my life.Another vital skill that team activities impart is problem-solving and adaptability. When working in a team, members bring different perspectives and expertise to tackle a problem. This diversity of thought encourages creative problem-solving, adaptability, and resilience. For example, in a team sports activity, I learned to adjust to changing circumstances, such as weather conditions or unexpected opponent strategies. This ability to adapt has helped me navigate uncertainties and challenges in my personal and academic life.Furthermore, team activities promote leadership, time management, and accountability. Each team member has to take responsibility for their tasks, manage their time, and lead when necessary. These skills are transferable to all areas of life, including career and personal relationships. In conclusion, I firmly believe that group or team activities provide a unique opportunity to acquire essential life skills, such as communication, problem-solving, and leadership, which are vital for achieving success and building strong relationships.
317;Write about the following topic.In many countries large amounts of foods are wasted. Why do you think people waste food in this way? What can be done to reduce the amount of food thrown away?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, many countries are confronted with the increasing amount of waste and one of the major contributions is food wasted by people. This issue is mainly driven by an over-ordered food and misunderstanding about the method of food disposal. However, people could cease from creating food waste through the act of both restaurants and governments.To begin with, it is obvious that countries have wasted because the amount of food that people buy is more than the amount they need. The crucial factor of this behavior is that when people contemplate menus in a restaurant, they tend to order many items in order to satisfy their desire level. Eventually, a lot of food scraps are left when these people finish eating their meals. Another potential cause could be because people do not know how to deal with food scraps. As a result, they might understand that putting wasted food into a garbage is the only solution they could do. This is exemplified by statistics published by Thai waste association which demonstrate that more than a half of waste in Thailand come from household food.A possible solution for this matter could be for restaurants to fine their customers who leave some food. This policy possibly encourages customers to carefully think of the reasonable amount of food when they order. In addition, from the country’s level governments could also educate their citizens including companies in the food-service industry about how to do with food waste due to the fact that some edible items could be food for animals. For instance, authorities could give an instruction demonstrating that dogs can be fed with remaining food such as rice or bread while remaining vegetables can be food for rabbits.In conclusion, people waste food since they order food by what they want without considering the amount and most of them misunderstand about the way to dispose of food waste. Nevertheless, this concern can be coped with the penalty by restaurants as well as the guidance from governments regarding feeding animal with food scraps.;"The issue of food waste has become a significant concern in many countries, with a substantial amount of edible food being discarded. In my opinion, the primary reason for food waste is the lack of planning and poor time management when it comes to grocery shopping and meal preparation. Many people tend to buy more food than they can consume, often due to the allure of discounts and promotions, without considering the shelf life of the products. Additionally, the rise of a ""throwaway culture"" has led to a mentality where people are more likely to discard food that is still edible, rather than finding ways to use it up.To mitigate food waste, individuals can take several steps. Firstly, planning meals and making a grocery list before shopping can help reduce the likelihood of buying too much food. Secondly, using up leftovers and finding creative ways to repurpose them can also minimize waste. For instance, leftover vegetables can be used to make a hearty soup or stew, while leftover bread can be turned into croutons or breadcrumbs.Governments and businesses also have a role to play in reducing food waste. Stores can implement ""ugly fruit"" sections, where misshapen or irregularly-sized produce is sold at a discounted price, reducing the amount of food that is rejected due to cosmetic reasons. Furthermore, food banks and charities can be supported to redistribute surplus food to those in need. In some countries, apps have been developed that allow users to purchase surplus food from restaurants and cafes at a discounted price, reducing waste and supporting local businesses. By adopting these strategies, we can significantly reduce the amount of food that is thrown away, and work towards a more sustainable and responsible food culture."
1025;Write about the following topic.In many countries, a small number of people earn extremely high salaries. Some people believe that this is good for the country, but others think that governments should not allow salaries above a certain level.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In many parts of the world, few people get a lot of money thanks to their job. It is believed by some that this is an advantage for the country, while it is thought by others that governments should put a limit above which salaries cannot be.In my opinion, I believe that not only people have to be rewarded for their performance, but also their wage salary has to be proportional to the benefits that they are leading to the country.For instance, due to the Covid a lot of people suffered several injuries which were cured only thanks to the doctors and the nurses. For this reason, since they are saving lifes everyday,it seems unbelievable the fact that they are earning much less money than football players.Another example can be found in people involved in the national security: I believe that it would be fairer if these professionals were paid more than an influencer.However, in our society this figures (such as doctors) are paid by governments through taxes, while football players or influncers gain incomes by private companies.In order to not impose an heavier taxation, politics should categorise jobs basing on their importance in the society. Hence, we will have a specific amount that these employers can earn.Thus, if these no-fundamental workers (like actors or actress) are earning more money than the precise level chosen, these will be used as funds to increase life-saving jobs' salary.In conclusion, I believe that highest salaries should exist only if we are referring to a job that is needed by everyone.;The issue of extremely high salaries earned by a small fraction of the population has sparked a heated debate in many countries. On one hand, some people argue that these high salaries are beneficial for the country as they attract top talent, drive innovation, and boost economic growth. For instance, tech giants like Google and Facebook offer astronomical salaries to lure the best engineers and researchers, which has led to groundbreaking innovations and significant contributions to the global economy.On the other hand, others believe that governments should impose a cap on salaries to reduce income inequality and promote fairness. They argue that excessive salaries can lead to a skewed distribution of wealth, where a tiny elite accumulates vast fortunes while the majority struggles to make ends meet. For example, in some countries, CEOs earn hundreds of times more than their average employees, which can perpetuate social and economic disparities.In my opinion, while high salaries can drive innovation and growth, governments should implement policies to ensure that income inequality is addressed. Imposing a cap on salaries might not be the most effective solution, as it could lead to a brain drain and reduced competitiveness. Instead, governments could introduce progressive taxation, where the wealthy are taxed at a higher rate, and use the revenue generated to fund social welfare programs and education. This approach would help reduce income inequality while still incentivizing innovation and hard work. Ultimately, striking a balance between attracting top talent and promoting economic fairness is crucial for a country's long-term prosperity and social cohesion.

Do you think it is a positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"At present, discovering one`s own family history is becoming more and more commom. In the following paragraphs, I will present the motives why people do that and the reason I strongly believe this is important and have positive effects on people.Probably the most crucial motive people search for their family`s past is to find out about any chronical diseases. One of society`s biggest concern nowadays is healthy leaving. Therefore, by knowing the family health history and genetic predisposition to a specific disease such as cancer or diabetes, one can prepare and take the appropriate mesures to prevent it or have an early treatment.Moreover, another reason people may seek for their ancestors`s history is to build a sense of belonging. Human beings need to feel welcomed and inserted into a culture; a community`s identity is as important as an individual one, as it provides people with the opportunity to grow and develop relantioships. When people know about their family history, their sense of belonging is promoted, and they can actively participate in their culture and contribute to their community.As mentioned in the previous paragraphs, people search about family history for health and cultural reasons. One and the other do impact positivily a person`s life, as being healthy and part of a community integrate people`s satisfaction about living.To summarize, one may try to find out about their family history for two main motives, one being about their health and the other one about feeling part of a community. Both reasons are important and have positive impacts on one`s life.";The pursuit of tracing one's family history has become a popular endeavor in various parts of the world. People engage in this activity for several reasons, primarily driven by a desire to understand their heritage, cultural roots, and the stories of their ancestors. By delving into their family's past, individuals can gain a deeper sense of identity and connection to their lineage. Furthermore, this exploration can also lead to the discovery of historical events, cultural traditions, and genetic information that may have been previously unknown.In my opinion, tracing one's family history is a positive endeavor. Not only does it foster a sense of belonging and pride, but it also promotes cross-cultural understanding and appreciation. For instance, learning about the migrations, struggles, and achievements of one's ancestors can provide valuable insights into the social, historical, and economic contexts that shaped their lives. This, in turn, can encourage empathy, tolerance, and a broader perspective on the complexities of human experience.Additionally, tracing family history can have practical benefits, such as uncovering genetic predispositions to certain health conditions, allowing individuals to take preventive measures. It can also lead to the reconnection with distant relatives, potentially expanding one's social network and support system. For example, genealogy websites and DNA testing services have made it possible for people to find long-lost relatives and learn about their ethnic origins, leading to a more nuanced understanding of their place within the global community.In conclusion, the search for one's family history is a worthwhile pursuit that offers numerous benefits, from personal growth and cultural enrichment to practical health and social advantages. As people continue to explore their ancestral roots, they not only honor their heritage but also contribute to a more interconnected and compassionate world.

However, the question: is dominating our lives by this technology have a negative or positive impact on our lives? Is considered one of the most controversial issues today. In this essay, I am going to examine this phenomenon from both viewpoints.On one side of the argument, some people argue that the benefits considerably outweigh the disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is integrating technology in every aspect eases our lives and decreases hardworking. For example, advanced houses with integrated voice commands give the person the ability to achieve multiple tasks without any physical activity. Moreover, the technology allows people to connect multiple devices with an email address and control them remotely. One good illustration of that you can switch on and off your home AC while you are at work by the WIFI technology.On the other hand, it is also possible to consider it with the opposing case. It is often argued that in fact using advanced technology increase the number of unhealthy people. People often have this opinion because people become lazier, and their daily activity dramatically decreases making them prone to diseases.As we have seen, there are no easy answers to this question. On balance, however, I tend to believe that using advanced information technology should be limited to simple tasks, so at any point if a technical error happened you can resume your life without any obstacles.;The advent of information technology has revolutionized various facets of our lives, profoundly impacting our home, leisure, and work activities. While there are drawbacks to this technological shift, I firmly believe that the benefits of information technology far outweigh the disadvantages.On the one hand, the benefits of information technology are multifaceted. For instance, it has enabled unparalleled access to information, facilitating learning and education. With the internet at our fingertips, we can acquire knowledge on virtually any subject, at any time, and from any location. Moreover, information technology has transformed the way we communicate, allowing us to stay connected with people globally, thereby fostering international relationships and collaborations. In the realm of work, it has increased efficiency and productivity, enabling remote work and reducing geographical barriers.On the other hand, there are disadvantages associated with information technology, such as privacy concerns, cyberbullying, and the potential for job displacement due to automation. However, these drawbacks can be mitigated through responsible use and the implementation of strict privacy and security measures. For example, using strong passwords, being cautious with online interactions, and supporting legislation that protects personal data can significantly reduce the risks associated with information technology.In conclusion, while acknowledging the existence of disadvantages, I believe that the benefits of information technology, including enhanced access to information, global connectivity, and increased work efficiency, significantly outweigh the drawbacks. With mindful usage and adequate safeguards, information technology can continue to positively transform our lives, making it an indispensable tool in today's digital age. By embracing this technology, we can harness its potential to improve our personal, social, and professional lives.
1033;Write about the following topic.It is inevitable that traditional cultures will be lost as technology develops. Technology and traditional cultures are incompatible.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many people hold the view that traditional culture and technological development cannot coexist as the latter catch on, the former will be bound to disappear. I totally disagree with this because both can be implemented jointly by putting technology at the service of tradition and through pilot projects.To begin with, technological progress, which is making major strides in our daily lives, is the means by which local mores, custom and traditions could be brought back to life, proving they are compatible. In fact, by tapping technology to make tradition far more attractive, considerably more audience will be engaged into such activities. Bologna is a case in point, since, thanks to digital machines and drones which have supported housewives into the making of , the traditional celebration of “making pasta day ” has recently being turned into a successful events, which draws people from country as far afield as China.Another example of possible coexistence is the possibility to heighten awareness of people costumes through the creation of pilot projects which bring both habits and technology to a new whole level. This can be put into practice by setting a direct connection to cultural heritage of a specific area of the world to those who do not have access easily. To this end, many primary schools in New York have developed a project in which, owing to the ultimate high speed connection, pupils who come from abroad can learn ancient craft directly from a master located in their country of origin.To conclude, I firmly believe that traditional culture and technology development are widely compatible as the technology can positively beef up the presence of cultural traditions nowadays, so as to keep its memory Alive. In addition, pioneering projects can be implemented to underpin cultural awareness amongst youngsters.;The notion that traditional cultures will inevitably be lost as technology advances has sparked intense debate. While some argue that technology and traditional cultures are incompatible, I partially disagree with this view. In my opinion, technology can both erode and preserve traditional cultures, depending on how it is utilized.On one hand, technological advancements can indeed lead to the erosion of traditional cultures. The widespread adoption of social media, for instance, has contributed to the homogenization of cultural practices, as people increasingly adopt globalized norms and values. Moreover, the rise of digital communication has reduced the need for traditional forms of storytelling and cultural expression, potentially leading to their decline. For example, the oral traditions of indigenous communities are at risk of being lost as younger generations increasingly rely on digital platforms for information and entertainment.On the other hand, technology can also serve as a powerful tool for preserving and promoting traditional cultures. Digital platforms can provide a global audience for traditional artists, musicians, and craftspeople, allowing them to share their work and connect with others who appreciate their cultural heritage. Furthermore, digital archives and museums can help preserve traditional cultural artifacts and historical records, making them accessible to a wider audience and ensuring their preservation for future generations. For instance, online platforms have enabled the revitalization of endangered languages, such as Hawaiian and Maori, by providing language learning resources and connecting language learners with native speakers.In conclusion, while technology poses some risks to traditional cultures, it is not inherently incompatible with them. By embracing technology in a thoughtful and culturally sensitive manner, we can harness its potential to preserve and promote traditional cultures, rather than allowing it to erode them. Ultimately, it is up to us to ensure that technology serves to enrich and diversify our cultural heritage, rather than diminish it.
1117;Write about the following topic.It is now possible for scientists and tourists to travel to remote natural environment, such as the South Pole.What are advantages and disadvantages of this development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Thanks to the development of our society, individuals can now travel to isolated areas, namely the South Pole. Never has this area been exploded before so researchers could discover crucial information for thesis and tourists could appreciate a fabulous landscape. However, discovering those faraway environments could increase environment-related issues such as climatic change.South Pole is a place which has ever seen human activities before, and it seems to have numerous discoveries to make. Indeed, scientists which fauna and flora are the current studies, could find new mode of the marine life and discover new species. Moreover, people who are interested in travelling to South Pole might now do it, children who dreamed about polar animals could see them. Thus, the tourism should create new jobs and develop economic growth.Nevertheless, as each breakthrough that the society does, there are repercussions. In this case, the harmful effect of this discovery is global warming because when humans go somewhere, they let a carbon footprint which directly changes the environment. For instance, if individuals had to travel to South Pole, they would only use air or marine transport such as cruise ship which pollute the area with greenhouse gases. As a result, those greenhouse gases can warm nature which, unfortunately, would melt the ice and have a detrimental impact on the landscapes. As a consequence, in the forthcoming decades, this panorama may disappear. Thereby, if scientists want to study this natural area, they could not or in a limited way.To conclude, the advantages could be to discover new landscapes and how species can live in this hostile area. However, just going into this remote natural environment could destroy it before discovering something.;The advancement in technology has made it possible for scientists and tourists to travel to remote natural environments, such as the South Pole. This development has both advantages and disadvantages.On the one hand, the advantages of traveling to remote natural environments are numerous. For scientists, it provides an opportunity to conduct research and collect data in pristine and untouched environments, which can lead to groundbreaking discoveries. For instance, scientists have been able to study the effects of climate change on the Antarctic ice sheet, which has significant implications for our understanding of global warming. Additionally, tourism in these areas can also promote conservation efforts and support local economies.On the other hand, there are also significant disadvantages to this development. The influx of tourists can lead to environmental degradation and pollution, which can harm the very ecosystems that scientists are trying to study. For example, the increasing number of tourists in the Galapagos Islands has led to the introduction of invasive species, which has threatened the unique biodiversity of the islands. Furthermore, the cost of traveling to these remote areas is often prohibitively expensive, which can limit access to only a select few, which can exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities.In conclusion, while traveling to remote natural environments has many advantages, including promoting scientific research and conservation efforts, it also has significant disadvantages, including environmental degradation and social inequalities. It is essential to strike a balance between promoting tourism and conservation in these areas, to ensure that the benefits of traveling to these remote environments are shared equitably and sustainably.
141;Write about the following topic.Many governments think that economic progress is their most important goal. Some people,however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;This is a world that fast developing and full of pollution.there is a worldwide problem whether economic progress is the most important goal when the other types problem are increasing. In my word is economic progress is important than other problems.Firstly,this is an economic world. human life condition is base on their income. For example,there have a village with poor people. They might working hard for live but they must have no time to think about other goal. This is reason why the governments to develop social economic . it is not uncommon that government have no money to solve the problem that environment pollution and others.Second, although economic progress is necessary for people but it also lead to other problems. With the increasing income it might need more resources to build the country. If it not solved correctly that give rise to more problems. The other types of progress will have a good developing when the economic progress finished and the government get enough money.Overall , i prefer economic progress to other types of progress. The better life come from money and the solution of the other types problem are come from the good economy.;The notion that economic progress is the paramount goal of governments has been a topic of debate among scholars and policymakers. On one hand, many governments prioritize economic growth, believing it to be the key to a country's prosperity and competitiveness in the global market. A strong economy provides better infrastructure, as well as higher standards of living, which in turn can lead to increased life expectancy, improved education, and advanced healthcare systems. For instance, countries like South Korea and Singapore have achieved remarkable economic growth, transforming themselves into economic powerhouses, which has significantly improved the quality of life for their citizens.On the other hand, some people argue that other types of progress, such as social, environmental, and cultural development, are equally important for a country's overall well-being. They contend that an overemphasis on economic progress can lead to environmental degradation, social inequality, and cultural homogenization. For example, countries like Bhutan and Costa Rica prioritize gross national happiness and environmental sustainability, respectively, which has led to a unique balance between development and preservation of natural and cultural heritage.In my opinion, while economic progress is crucial, it should not come at the expense of other essential aspects of development. A balanced approach that considers social, environmental, and cultural progress alongside economic growth is more sustainable and equitable in the long run. This holistic approach can lead to more resilient and content societies. For instance, the Nordic countries, which consistently rank high in terms of happiness and quality of life, demonstrate a successful balance between economic prosperity and social welfare, showcasing that economic progress and other forms of progress are not mutually exclusive, but complementary goals that can be achieved simultaneously. Therefore, governments should strive for a multifaceted development strategy that prioritizes the well-being of both the economy and the society as a whole.
555;Write about the following topic.Many parents today organise extra classes for their children after school and at the weekends.Do you feel that this is a worthwhile thing to do or do you feel children have enough education at school?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays educational institutions are equipped with devices that were unimaginable only a few years ago, which offer many opportunities to children to study every kind of subject. In other words, the technology introduced in schools helps many children to learn various subjects with different gadgets, such geography, art, maths by computers or history by means of audio-visual-techniques. However, I believe that children thanks to these appealing methods of learning have enough education and they need some time to unwind and experience their life with other activites.To begin with, apply children to extra classes at the weekends has become an issue of debate by many people. I hold firmly to the belief that children after schools need to dedicate their free time on sports. However, sports and other physical activities help young people to enhance their concentration, self-esteem and cognitive skills, social skills with their peer group. For example the most popular and suitable to children are sports with teams, such as football, basketball etc... where children could learn how to collaborate with other mates and the leadership skills gained in sports can help kids to excel in school, life and in the workplace, such as organising a good teamwork.On the other hand, there are few parents who argue that children need to attend extra classes at schools during the weekends. For instance, the world is still facing a global pandemic of covid-19, which caused many problems of attendency of students in many educational institutions due to various measures introduced. However this led many students to lazyness and reduction of methods of gaining knowledge, because it is widely believed that online lessons are not interactive as the lessons in presence. Moreover using continously a technological gadget for hours may cause distraction and negative mental effects. So the better solution for some people is to let their children do extra classes in presence in order to make up for the hours lost during the online lessons.To sum up, children need to experience different activities afterschool in order to have a good educational career. However some parents consider the extra classes an acceptable opportunity to not lose the methods of studying.;The trend of parents organizing extra classes for their children outside of regular school hours has become increasingly common. While some argue that this provides children with a competitive edge, others believe that it puts undue pressure on them. In my opinion, the decision to enroll children in extra classes depends on the individual child's needs and circumstances.On the one hand, extra classes can be highly beneficial for children who require additional support or are interested in pursuing a particular subject in greater depth. For instance, a child who is struggling with math can attend extra tutoring sessions to improve their understanding and grades. Similarly, children who exhibit a talent for a specific subject, such as music or art, can attend extra classes to hone their skills and nurture their creativity.On the other hand, some children may already be receiving a comprehensive education at school and may not require extra classes. In such cases, attending additional classes can lead to burnout and decreased motivation. Furthermore, children need time to relax, play and engage in extracurricular activities to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Overloading them with extra classes can deprive them of this essential downtime, ultimately affecting their mental and physical well-being.In conclusion, while extra classes can be beneficial for some children, it is essential for parents to assess their child's individual needs and make informed decisions. By doing so, parents can ensure that their children receive a well-rounded education that caters to their unique requirements, without compromising their overall well-being. Ultimately, it is crucial to strike a balance between academics and leisure time to allow children to grow into happy, healthy and well-adjusted individuals.
305;Write about the following topic.Many people use written language in a less formal and more relaxed way. Why? Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, written language is used in comparatively more informal and relaxed way. I assume that it happens because of the need of making communication easier and faster. Without features of formal written language it is simplier to share your idea in a shorter period of time. This option is essential in a modern temp of life. This essay will cover both advantages and disadvantages of this development.The less formal and tense written language provides some pros. First of all, without formalization the process of communication requires less amount of time. Then letters consists of less number of symbols and can help to solve the discussed problem much faster. Moreover, this way of communication does not support formal borders between members of a dialogue. Then it is easier to come closer with the interlocutor and feel no pressure during the using of written language.On the other hand, development of making written language more informal and relaxed has some cons. Firstly, communication goes less respectful. Then interlocutors have almost no opportunity to pay a respect to each other. Formalized written language is significant in issue of social borders that can hihlight a paid respect. Secondly, sometimes the main gist of the letter goes unclear, because informal language is more relaxed. In these conditions, the quidity of the letter can be hidden with less formal features. If participants of the communication are not close, they will not understand each other correctly.In conclusion I would like to say that the process of using written language in a more informal way has both advantages and disadvantages. It can be revealed in different situations. That is why everyone should have their own opinion based on the information discussed in this essay.;The way people use written language has undergone a significant shift in recent years. Many individuals now employ a less formal and more relaxed tone in their writing, particularly in digital communication. This trend can be attributed to the rise of social media, text messaging, and email, which have made writing a more casual and spontaneous activity.One reason for this development is the increasing informality of modern life. With the proliferation of digital platforms, people are more likely to write in an informal tone, as they would in face-to-face conversations. For instance, social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook encourage brief, conversational posts, which often lack the formalities of traditional written language. Moreover, the speed and brevity required in digital communication have led to a more relaxed writing style, with people using abbreviations, acronyms, and emojis to convey their messages quickly.This shift has both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, a more relaxed writing style can facilitate faster and more effortless communication, allowing people to express themselves more freely and spontaneously. It can also make written language more accessible and engaging, particularly for younger generations who are accustomed to digital communication. On the other hand, the decline of formal writing skills can lead to a lack of clarity and precision in communication, potentially causing misunderstandings and miscommunications. Furthermore, the informality of written language can also undermine the importance of proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation, which are essential skills for effective communication.In conclusion, the trend towards a less formal and more relaxed written language is a natural consequence of the digital age. While it offers advantages in terms of speed and accessibility, it also poses risks to the clarity and precision of communication. As we navigate this new landscape of written language, it is essential to strike a balance between informality and formality, ensuring that our writing remains effective, engaging, and respectful.
1161;Write about the following topic.More and more people are relying on the private car as their major means of transportation.Describe some of the problems over-reliance on cars can cause, and suggest at least one possible solution.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;That of trasportation is a question that have troubled all the people over the world, whatever it is the city or town in which they live. In the last years people used to relying on the private car to move around. . Although the possible reasons that persuaded people to use private cars, the problems that rise from their excessive use, such us traffic and pollution, are harsh consequences to be accepted. I think that an improvement of public trasportation and to incentive the use of ecological means of trasport like bicycle should be possible solution to those issues.Cars are considered the most confortable mean of trasport. In particular, if you have to move in a big cities like Milan. Indeed, means of trasports sometimes are late or full and also more unsafe. If you are a woman, for example, the use of public trasportation in some part of Italy is not safe mostly during the night hours. Another problem is that of comfort. If people use their car they can go whethever they want, when they want. If they have to spend more time in a place, they have not to be worried about the last bus they had to take to come back home.However, over-reliance of cars cause at least two big problmes: traffic and pollution. On the one hand, the problem of traffic will produce other issues such as anxiety and irritation. Indeed, if you have to go work in the morning and you live in a city like Rome you have to consider at least one hour spent in the traffic. Pollution is surely the most severe issue. Indeed, if all the people used to take a private car, then it is easely imaginable how much cars and fuel can be consumed daily. The two problems are linked, I want to underline, indeed, the noise pollution that derives from an intense traffic. It should be considered dangerous both for persons and animals.Two possible solutions to the problem of the over-reliance on cars are the following. Firstly, public trasportation should be improved. Indeed, if bus and tram were more safe and more confortable, then people would be more tent by their use. At least, they will solve the problem of traffic. On the other hand, I see the echologycal means of transport like bycicle as the new border to pass in order to save the world from pollution. One possible suggestion would be that of make cheaper the bycicle and also to give an economic subsidy to those people who decide to help the planet using them.In conclusion, I believe that the the use of private cars, because of the problems that it causes, should be discouraged. Two possible solutions rely on the improvement of public trasportation and on the incentive can be given to those using non-polluting means of trasport;The increasing reliance on private cars as the primary means of transportation has become a pervasive trend in many parts of the world. This over-reliance on cars can cause a multitude of problems, affecting not only the environment but also the quality of life in urban areas. One of the most significant issues is the escalation of traffic congestion, which leads to wasted time, increased air pollution, and higher levels of stress among commuters. Furthermore, the emissions from vehicles contribute to climate change and deteriorate air quality, posing serious health risks to the population.Another problem stemming from the dominance of car culture is the urban sprawl, where cities expand outward, leading to less densely populated areas. This can result in the destruction of natural habitats and farmlands, as well as an increased demand for lengthy and costly infrastructure projects, such as road expansions and parking facilities.To mitigate these issues, one possible solution is the development and enhancement of public transportation systems. Efficient, reliable, and affordable public transport can significantly reduce the number of private vehicles on the road, thereby decreasing traffic congestion and emissions. For instance, cities like Tokyo and New York have comprehensive and well-integrated public transportation networks, including subways, buses, and trains, which encourage the use of shared transportation over private cars. Additionally, the implementation of pedestrian-friendly and bike-friendly infrastructure can also promote alternative modes of transportation that are healthier and more environmentally friendly.In conclusion, the over-reliance on private cars is a pressing issue that requires immediate attention and action. By investing in robust public transportation systems and promoting sustainable transportation alternatives, we can work towards creating more livable, environmentally conscious cities for future generations. It is imperative that governments, urban planners, and individuals collaborate to find and implement effective solutions to this challenge, ensuring a healthier and more sustainable transportation future.
1051;"Write about the following topic.Most people have forgotten the meaning behind traditional or religious festivals; during festival periods, people nowadays only want to enjoy themselves.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.";"In recent years, it is argued that many people have lost track of the meaning behind traditional and religious celebrations; Now, people seem to treat these celebrations as another holiday break. The following essay will fully endorse the statement and examine the reasons behind it.Firstly, there are several reasons why people forgot about the message behind celebrations. One of the most significant one is globalisation. As people start connecting with each other through social media worldwide, many people are too distracted with the latest trends and updates. A study from Yales University mentioned that 60% of the population on earth do not persuit the stories about their traditional roots and background. Hence, they do not celebrate festive or cultural events meaningfully. Another important reason is broken families. People who experienced a tough childhood without a male or female parent are not capable of understanding their own traditions and values. Therefore, they do not grasp the concept of cultural celebrations.Moreover, there are also cons to this arguments as people just want to take a holiday break. Although people may argue that it is important to remember the intention behind diverse celebrations, others just want to use the day for self-fulfillment purposes. For example, people would organise a party and invite friends over to their house so they can have a good time. Another argument that people only want enjoyment during festive periods is work-stress related illnesses. The majority of middle class workers are hardworking and dedicated to their job. However, the period of time for holiday breaks are significantly short and they just want to use the celebration events to rest at home. Despite the fact that they are neglecting their duties to demonstrate the meaning behind these celebrations to the younger generations, they also have a right to take care of themselves mentally and physically before others.In conclusion, there are both sides of the argument on why people think others have forgotten the meaning behind event celebrations and why this is not neccesarily true all the time. Personally, I agree that people should always find the meaning behind these celebrations in order to understand themselves better.";The statement that most people have forgotten the meaning behind traditional or religious festivals and only seek enjoyment during these periods is a notion that sparks debate. While it is true that many individuals nowadays tend to focus on the celebratory aspects of festivals, I only partially agree with this opinion.On one hand, the commercialization and secularization of festivals have led to a shift in people's perception of these events. Many festivals, such as Christmas and Halloween, have become heavily commercialized, with the emphasis being on gift-giving, costumes, and parties rather than their original religious or cultural significance. As a result, it is not uncommon to see people celebrating these festivals without a deep understanding or appreciation of their historical and symbolic meanings.On the other hand, there are still many individuals and communities who continue to observe and respect the traditional and religious aspects of festivals. For example, in many Asian cultures, the Lunar New Year is a time for family reunions, sacred rituals, and reflections on the past year, in addition to the festivities and fireworks. Similarly, religious festivals like Easter and Diwali are still deeply rooted in their spiritual contexts for millions of people around the world.In my own experience, I have noticed that while some people may indeed prioritize the entertainment aspects of festivals, there is also a significant number of individuals who make a conscious effort to understand and honor the underlying meanings and traditions of these celebrations. This balance between enjoyment and reverence is possible and is practiced by many.In conclusion, while it is accurate to say that some people have forgotten the original meanings of traditional and religious festivals, it is not a universal truth. Many still hold these festivals in high regard for their cultural and spiritual significance, alongside the joy and celebration they bring.
939;Write about the following topic.Music is played in every society and culture in the world today.Some people think that music brings only benefits to individuals and societies. Others, however, think that music can have a negative influence on both.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Music is the moonlight in the gloomy night of life.It is the universal language of mankind.There are mixed opinions about music on whether it is advantageous or not to individuals and society.This essay will discuss about pros and cons of music being part of our life.Some people have a perception that playing or listening to music is not beneficial in any manner. They feel music separates a person from socializing and that it is a form of addiction and distraction.Especially, parents feel that their child's concentration is impacted while multitasking with music and studies.For extroverts its a sort of discomfort or hindrance.Few extroverts feel better to share their feelings and difficulties with others than staying alone and listening to a song. Few recorded instances has suggested that sad music inculcates negative thoughts and aggression while in depression.On the other hand, there are people who think that music having a negative effect on individual and society is completely preposterous.They feel that tunes produces a kind of pleasure which human nature cannot do without.Music is a form of expression of feelings rather than being a hindrance.It greatly helps people to overcome their hurdles.Soothing and melodious music gives a refreshing effect.Jazz and Pop music facilitates society to come together and dance.Concerrts helps certain groups to spend time for relaxation from their busy schedule.Not only that, singing or playing instruments is a form of expression of their feelings.The essay argued that though music is considered to be a distraction , it is a form of rejuvenation to both society and individuals of all age groups.;The universal language of music is an integral part of every society and culture, transcending geographical and linguistic barriers. While some people believe that music has only positive effects on individuals and societies, the others think that it can have a negative impact. In this essay, I will discuss both views and provide my opinion on the matter.On the one hand, music is often credited with numerous benefits. It has the power to evoke emotions, create a sense of community, and provide a platform for self-expression. For instance, music has been used as a tool for social change, with many artists using their music to raise awareness about social issues and promote unity. Moreover, research has shown that listening to music can have a positive impact on mental health, reducing stress and anxiety. Music also plays a significant role in preserving cultural heritage, with traditional music and dance being an essential part of many cultural festivals and celebrations.On the other hand, some people argue that music can have a negative influence. For example, certain genres of music, such as heavy metal or gangsta rap, may promote violence, aggression, and misogyny. Additionally, music can be used as a means of propaganda, spreading hateful ideologies and divisive messages. Furthermore, excessive noise from music can be a source of disturbance, affecting people's daily lives and causing noise pollution.In my opinion, music is a double-edged sword, capable of bringing both benefits and drawbacks. While it has the power to inspire and unite, it can also be used to manipulate and divide. Ultimately, the impact of music depends on the context and intentions behind it. As a responsible individual, it is essential to be mindful of the music we listen to and promote, ensuring that it has a positive influence on ourselves and society. By doing so, we can harness the power of music to create a more harmonious and inclusive world.
587;Write about the following topic.Nowadays, sports is a big business with high earnings for professional sports people and companies involved both financially and other ways. Is this a positive or negative development for sports?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is argued that using mobile devices is as antisocial as smoking and that in certain areas smoking has been forbidden so mobile devices should be prohibited as well. I strongly disagree with this statement because this would not solve the initial problem and could turn out expensive as well.Firstly, banning mobile devices from certain places would be exagerated. This is because smoking actually damages your body, while the use of mobile phones is comparatively harmless. For example, a recent research found out that the risk of lung cancer grows by 0,02% with every cigarette, while high screen time has less damaging side effects like the loss of concentration. Altough the use of mobile phones is sometimes antisocial, I think that we should concentrate on the origins of this problem than simply prohibit it in certain areas.Secondly, banning mobile devices would have a regulatory side effect which could be expensive. The government would have to decide on new laws as well as implement them. Furthermore, it would be no easy task for the police to control these rules in an efficient way. As a result, police would struggle with a high workload. Admittely, I have enough faith in our legal system and I am sure that they could manage it but I think that we have more prescious und urgent tasks to concentrate on.In conclusion, I strongly disagree with banning mobile devices in certain areas. However, I admit that we use our phones too much which sometimes leads to antisocial behaviour. Nevertheless, prohibiting the phones in certain areas would not solve this problem and could as well be expensive for the government.;The commercialization of sports has become a significant phenomenon in recent years, with professional sportspeople and companies reaping substantial financial benefits. In my opinion, this development has both positive and negative implications for sports.On the positive side, the influx of money into sports has improved the overall quality of competitions, as top athletes can now focus on their training and performance without financial worries. For instance, top footballers like Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi earn millions of dollars in endorsements and salaries, which enables them to maintain their exceptional skill levels. Additionally, the financial investment in sports infrastructure has led to the construction of state-of-the-art stadiums and facilities, enhancing the spectator experience and athlete performance.However, the commercialization of sports also has its downsides. The prioritization of financial gain over sporting values has led to an increased focus on winning at all costs, rather than promoting fair play and sportsmanship. This is exemplified by the numerous doping scandals in athletics and cycling, where athletes have risked their health and reputation for a competitive edge. Furthermore, the high earnings of professional sportspeople have created unrealistic expectations and pressures on young athletes, potentially damaging their mental and physical well-being.In conclusion, while the commercialization of sports has brought numerous benefits, such as improved athlete performances and facilities, it also poses significant risks to the integrity and values of sports. To maintain a balance between financial gain and sporting principles, governing bodies and organizations must prioritize fair play, sportsmanship, and athlete welfare, ensuring that the true spirit of sports is preserved amidst the lucrative business dealings.
1133;Write about the following topic.People in all modern societies use drugs, but today's youth are experimenting with both legal and illegal drugs, and at an increasingly early age. Some sociologists claim that parents and other members of society often set a bad example.Discuss the causes and some effects of widespread drug use by young people in modern day society. Make any recommendations you feel are necessary to help fight youth drug abuse.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The use of drugs has been a warning habit in modern day society. In some research, it shows that households are losing their financing easily due to the fact that one of the parents has been addicted to drugs. Although there are some drugs which were approved by the government to be used moderately, yet some people are using these drugs heavily.This has drawn the attention of the youth either by a drug addict parent or a friend. Moreover, the number of youngsters taking drugs has increased dramatically throughout the years as there are people who provide these drugs in the black market. This critical issue has caused serious issues both socially and mentally.The social and mental impact of using drugs by the youngsters have damaged the educational progress, the social participation such as family and friends gatherings. Additionally, lack of stamina, weight loss, and loss of appetite are key factors of excessive use of drugs.There is a number of contributing elements to the phenomena. One of these elements is the sense of belonging to a group. Since humans are social animals, young people want to have the feeling of being accepted and loved, and this can be sensible when it comes to a group of friends. Therefore, once someone introduces a drug, the rest of the group will try, and if one says no, then they will be rejected. However, this rejection can be helping to solve this alarming issue.The solution is to find a way to distinguish the types of drugs and legalize the ones that do not harm greatly and prepare in parallel the better ways to control the consumption of drugs.;The widespread use of drugs among young people in modern society is a pressing concern. Sociologists argue that parents and other members of society often set a bad example, which contributes to the early experimentation with both legal and illegal drugs. One of the primary causes of this issue is the normalization of drug use in everyday life. Many young people are exposed to drug use through social media, peer pressure, and even family members, which can lead them to believe that drug use is acceptable and harmless.Another significant factor is the lack of education and awareness about the dangers of drug use. Many schools and families fail to provide adequate information and guidance, leaving young people vulnerable to the lure of drugs. Furthermore, the stress and pressure of modern life, including academic and social expectations, can drive young people to seek escape and relief through drug use.The effects of widespread drug use among young people are devastating. It can lead to addiction, health problems, and even death. Additionally, it can negatively impact their mental and emotional well-being, relationships, and future prospects. For instance, a study found that drug use among teenagers can lead to a significant decrease in their academic performance and increase the risk of dropping out of school.To combat youth drug abuse, it is essential to provide education and awareness programs that effectively inform young people about the risks and consequences of drug use. Parents, educators, and community leaders must set a good example and engage in open and honest conversations with young people. Moreover, governments and organizations should invest in evidence-based prevention and treatment programs that address the root causes of drug use and provide support for those struggling with addiction. By working together, we can help young people make informed choices and reduce the devastating effects of drug abuse.
981;Write about the following topic.Psychologists have known for many years that colour can affect how people feel. For this reason, attention should be given to colour schemes when decorating places such as offices and hospitals.How true is this statement?How far does colour influence people’s health and capacity for work?;The colours and its affect on humans feelings always interested the psychologists and become a part of their researches. This researches get the attention of the organizations and help them to shape their designs of their offices or buildings. In this essay, I will talk about the affects of colour and its influence on some parts of human's life.It is true that certain colours are affecting our mental state and feelings at some level. Because of our visual plays an important role in our pyschology, colours are becoming important issue that needs to be point out. For example, the alertness effect of red colour on human's feeling is well known by the goverments. In order to alert people, stop signs or traffic lights are always include some level of red colour. This way, humans can be warned and accidents numbers can be decreased.Also, this affect of colours can play a big role in our health and work place. To give an example, the infinity effect of white colour is always used by hospitals. They paint their desks, tables, rooms, bathrooms or walls to white colour most of the time. This way, they calm their patients and help them to relieve their stress. Another example is grey. It is one of the favourite colour of the companies. They use this colour mainly in their office to make sure their employees are not distracted so they can finish their task.To conclude, colours are very affective in our mood and feelings. They are being used by the organizations to benefit from this effect.;The impact of colour on human emotions and behaviour has been a subject of interest for psychologists for decades. The statement that colour schemes should be given attention when decorating places like offices and hospitals is indeed true. Research has shown that colours can have a profound effect on people's mood, health, and productivity. In the context of offices, the use of colours can either stimulate or calm employees, depending on the desired outcome. For instance, colours like blue and green are known to promote feelings of calmness and serenity, which can be beneficial in high-stress work environments. On the other hand, colours like orange and yellow can increase energy levels and boost creativity, making them ideal for spaces that require innovation and problem-solving.Similarly, in hospitals, the strategic use of colours can play a crucial role in patient recovery and staff well-being. Soothing colours like light blue and pale green can create a sense of tranquility, reducing anxiety and stress in patients. Additionally, colours like red and purple can stimulate the brain, promoting alertness and focus among medical staff.The influence of colour on people's health and capacity for work is significant. Studies have demonstrated that exposure to certain colours can lower blood pressure, heart rate, and stress levels, while improving mood and cognitive function. Furthermore, the thoughtful application of colour schemes can also impact employee absenteeism, job satisfaction, and overall productivity.In conclusion, the consideration of colour schemes when decorating offices and hospitals is not just aesthetically important, but also crucial for the well-being and performance of occupants. By harnessing the power of colours, we can create environments that promote emotional balance, physical health, and mental acuity, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes and work efficiency. As such, the statement holds substantial truth, and colour schemes should indeed be a priority in the design of these spaces.
1173;Write about the following topic.Rich countries should allow jobs for skilled and knowledgeable employees who are from poor countries. Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"In development countries they must allow works for people who have skills and experience employees from poor countries. I agree with this point of view because everyone they should have a chance. There were a opportunities and benefits.The first point, I would like to make is that there were a great opportunities for both rich countries and people who came from poor areas. When people thinking to transfer abroad there were many reason but the most important when they want a chance to show of there craft and ability. Such as, Indian people they travelled many areas and they give them a lot of discoveries and skills; moreover, the rich countries need some people to help to make their country better place for living. For example, I have read an article in the newspaper they talked about development countries like UK, US and Arabic countries they need those people to improve their economy and life.The second point, I will clarify is that there were many benefits when this countries allow jobs for those. They will be equality for all ;furthermore, there will be a improvement in living. For instance, I have saw a T.V decomontry they say "" In United States there are a equality and improvement in live between people they came from Africaand citizens they help them to have good education, skills and experience also they contribute the US economy to growth "".Finally, we can say that there were a opportunities and benefits for both sides. I am with this to have good life for all. I hope in the future poor countries they can take benefits from those people and developed their country to came better than now .";The notion that rich countries should permit skilled and knowledgeable employees from poor countries to work within their borders is a contentious issue. In my opinion, I strongly agree with this proposition. Allowing skilled workers from impoverished nations to secure jobs in affluent countries can have a multitude of benefits for both parties involved.On one hand, the rich countries can gain from the influx of skilled workers as they bring in fresh perspectives, innovative ideas, and specialized skills that may be in short supply domestically. For instance, skilled doctors and nurses from poor countries can help alleviate shortages in healthcare systems in rich countries, thus improving the overall quality of healthcare services. Furthermore, skilled workers can contribute to the economic growth of the host country through taxation and consumer spending.On the other hand, the skilled workers from poor countries can benefit immensely from the opportunity to work in rich countries. Not only do they gain higher salaries and better working conditions, but they also acquire valuable experience and skills that they can eventually take back to their home countries. This brain gain can help poor countries develop their own economies and reduce poverty in the long run. For example, Indian software engineers working in the United States can return to India and establish their own tech companies, thus fostering economic development and job creation in India.In conclusion, allowing skilled and knowledgeable employees from poor countries to work in rich countries is a win-win situation. It can lead to cultural diversity, economic growth, and skill transfer. Therefore, rich countries should open their doors to skilled workers from poor countries, as it can have a positive impact on both the host country and the workers' countries of origin.
973;Write about the following topic.Some organisations believe that their employees should dress smartly. Others value quality of work above appearance.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Manners in the workplace have always been a topic that is discussed by many people as it is essential to know how we should behave in such a formal environment. Some companies give the opinion that their workers should have a smart look while others consider the attitude toward the job more important.To my mind, appearance should not the only thing to be considered. We can dress smartly and impress others, but it is only the first impression. Therefore, productivity, quality of work, and the way we are responsible for our tasks are things that make us outstanding workers. Moreover, it is obvious that the success of one company does not depend on how its employees dress but on how it is organized.In spite of the fact that dressing does not play a key role in the value of a worker, a neat and intelligent appearance still gives us significant benefits. I always suggest that one should dress suitably in different situations. In fact, it is not crucial for an organization to ask their employees to dress formally, but a set of smart casual clothes is something that we should wear when it comes to the working environment. It is because that wearing politely shows how we respect our jobs, our employers, and even our workmates. In some cases, a company's professionalism can be seen through the way its workers wear.To sum up, dressing smartly is not the best and only thing that one worker can do to have better performance. However, having a good appearance is something that great employees would do since it can be considered as their respect for the jobs.;The debate about whether employees should dress smartly or focus on the quality of their work has sparked intense discussion among organisations. On one hand, some companies believe that dressing smartly is essential as it reflects the company's image and professionalism. For instance, a bank or a law firm may require their employees to wear formal attire to project a sense of trust and reliability to their clients. This dress code can also boost employees' confidence and motivation, as they feel more put together and prepared to tackle their work.On the other hand, some organisations prioritise the quality of work above appearance, arguing that it is the output that matters, not the dress code. This approach can be seen in tech companies or startups where the focus is on innovation and creativity. Employees are encouraged to dress casually, which can foster a more relaxed and collaborative work environment. This, in turn, can lead to increased productivity and better job satisfaction.In my opinion, I believe that quality of work should take precedence over appearance. While dressing smartly can create a good impression, it is the employee's skills, dedication, and work ethic that ultimately determine their success. Moreover, a strict dress code can stifle creativity and individuality, which are essential for innovation and progress. For example, companies like Google and Facebook have adopted casual dress codes, which has not hindered their success, but rather contributed to their innovative and dynamic work culture. In conclusion, while dressing smartly has its benefits, I believe that organisations should prioritise the quality of work, allowing employees to focus on their tasks and express their individuality, rather than adhering to a strict dress code.
495;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that it is good to share as much information as possible in scientific research, business and the academic world. Others believe that some information is too important or too valuable to be shared freely.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In recent years, some people believe that it is good to share information about scientific research, business and the academic field to many people. Others reckon that such informations are too important or too valuable to be share for free. Here are discussions of the statements and my opinion.By development of the technology, people can more likely to access to valuable information such as experimental results and interviewing results of citizens than before. Some people use it for their academic interests or for the business strategies, so that people believe that such information contribute to companies profits or individuals' advantages in academic. For example, many of the medical students read dissertation of diseases, which were written in the past. By reading and using the scientific information students will become excellent professionals.On the other hand, people can access informations from any countries via internet. Recently, increasing the cyber crimes is the serious problem all over the world. Therefore some people reckon that it is too risky to share valuable informations. If information on valuable national research results is leaked, the country would had enormous loss for the economy.To sum up ,sharing as much informations as possible is useful for the everyone to improve their academic skills and contribute to their companies, while easier access to every aspects of informations might bring disadvantages such as information leakage or cybercrime. In my opinion, I mostly agree with it is good to share information, but I believe the source of information needs to be careful not to misuse the sources.;The debate surrounding the sharing of information in scientific research, business, and academia has sparked intense discussion. On one hand, some individuals believe that sharing as much information as possible is beneficial, as it fosters collaboration, drives innovation, and accelerates progress. This approach has led to numerous breakthroughs in various fields, such as medicine and technology, where open-source research and data sharing have enabled scientists to build upon each other's findings and achieve remarkable results.On the other hand, others argue that certain information is too valuable or sensitive to be shared freely. In the business world, for instance, proprietary information, such as trade secrets and intellectual property, can be a company's most valuable asset. Sharing such information could lead to unfair competition, financial losses, and even bankruptcy. Similarly, in academia, researchers may be hesitant to share their findings prematurely, as it could lead to others taking credit for their work or exploiting their ideas.In my opinion, a balanced approach is necessary. While sharing information can be beneficial, it is equally important to protect sensitive and valuable data. A selective sharing approach, where information is shared among trusted parties or through secure channels, can mitigate the risks associated with unrestricted sharing. For example, in scientific research, data can be shared anonymously or through peer-reviewed journals, ensuring that credit is given where it is due. Ultimately, the key to successful information sharing lies in striking a balance between collaboration and protection, allowing progress to be made while safeguarding valuable and sensitive information. By adopting this approach, we can harness the benefits of information sharing while minimizing its potential drawbacks.
273;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Environmental problems are the biggest issue that people have to concern and by product form fossil fuels is one of causes. Someone think one way that can reduce result from fuels is sale car fuels in higher price. In my opinion, I disagree with this because highly price of oil leads to other problems such as financial problem and impact to food price, moreover, we can heal their environment by other ways.The negative effects of increasing the cost of vehciles fuels are improtant to human life. The significant points is price of basic requirements, for instance, foods and medicines which have to transportation by trucks that use oil fuels for movement. The expensive fuels increase business costs, so their products price are rising up. Futhermore, social problems follow by financial problems. When poor people do not have money but they still hunger, they will steal some food or water this situation roads to social problems.Other ways to reduce environment problems, the causes of this problem are not only fossil fuel but also agricultural or industial aspect which we have to focus on. Intustial areas are the top areas that make lot of pollutions such as air pollution, water pollution from thier procesing and chemical pollution which they use during process. Those of them lead to many problems and effect to qulity of human life. Moveover agricultural areas, there produce many of gas which result to global warming.In conclusion, the increasing car fuels might reduce some of environmental problems but also have drawback to population life. We should to chooce other ways to protect enviromant without effect to our life.;The notion that increasing the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles is an effective solution to environmental problems has garnered significant attention in recent years. In my opinion, I partially agree with this statement, as I believe that increasing fuel costs can have both positive and negative impacts on the environment.On the one hand, increasing the cost of fuel can lead to a reduction in the number of vehicles on the road, which in turn can decrease air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. For instance, in countries like Norway and Sweden, high fuel taxes have led to a significant shift towards electric and hybrid vehicles, resulting in a substantial decrease in emissions. Additionally, higher fuel costs can also encourage people to use public transport, walk, or cycle, further reducing the environmental impact of transportation.On the other hand, increasing fuel costs can have negative consequences, particularly for low-income households and businesses that rely heavily on transportation. For example, in developing countries where public transport is limited, higher fuel costs can lead to increased costs of living, affecting the livelihoods of many people. Moreover, it may also lead to a shift towards alternative, but not necessarily environmentally friendly, fuels such as coal or wood, which can exacerbate environmental problems.In conclusion, while increasing the cost of fuel can be an effective measure to reduce environmental problems, it is not a straightforward solution. Governments should consider a range of measures, including investing in public transport, promoting alternative energy sources, and implementing targeted taxes and subsidies to encourage environmentally friendly behaviors. Ultimately, a balanced approach that takes into account the social, economic, and environmental impacts is necessary to effectively address environmental problems.
135;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that school children should not be given homework by their teachers, whereas others argue that homework plays an important role in the education of children.Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The issue that whether teachers should assign homework or not has attracted great attention recently.Some people believe that homework is a good way to consolidate students'learning effect.However,others argue that homework exerts huge pressure on students,which is bad for their long-term development.As for me,appropriate homework should be seen as the better choice.I will explain my idea from two aspects.Firstly,homework could examine student's learning results.After teaching the basic content,giving some homework is important to consolidate the knowledge.As an old saying goes,practice makes things perfect.Only doing many practices,can we master the knowledge proficiently.There is an example.In my teaching experiences,I found the students finishing their homework better would achieve higher scores in final examination,while those who couldn't finish their ordinary homework would gain lower grades in any examination.And my translation skills were also improved by practicing the homework from my guiders who gave the targeted examination to me.Secondly,too much homework will cause so many negative effects,such as making students tired very much,causing their depressed mood and their bored emotion.For example,my brother's daughter always suffered from the huge homework which was assigned by his Chinese teacher.She once complained with me that everyday she felt tired and bored after finishing Chinese teacher's assignments.So appropriate homework is reasonable for most students and those ideas that the more homework,the better students' scores ,are wrong to certain extent.Sometimes huge homework is the reason that why some students'scores are reduced.In sum,removing homework is not an ideal option for student's improvement in learning,and reasonable homework provides us a better way to deal with the problem.That is to say,we should strike a balance between assigning homework and removing homework.;The debate over whether school children should be given homework has sparked intense discussion among educators and parents. On one hand, some people believe that homework is unnecessary and can be detrimental to a child's physical and mental well-being. They argue that children already spend a significant amount of time in school and should be allowed to relax and engage in extracurricular activities outside of school hours. This, they claim, will help to reduce stress and prevent burnout.On the other hand, others argue that homework plays a crucial role in the education of children. They believe that homework helps to reinforce learning, develop critical thinking skills, and promote self-discipline and responsibility. Homework also allows teachers to assess a child's understanding of a particular concept and provide additional support where needed. For instance, in my own experience, homework has helped me to better understand complex mathematical concepts and improve my problem-solving skills.In my opinion, homework is essential to a child's educational development. While it is true that excessive homework can be counterproductive, a reasonable amount of homework can help to solidify learning and prepare children for future academic challenges. Moreover, homework teaches children important life skills such as time management, organization, and self-motivation. However, teachers should ensure that homework is meaningful, relevant, and manageable, and not simply a chore or busywork. By striking a balance between schoolwork and homework, children can develop a love of learning, achieve academic success, and thrive in their future endeavors. Ultimately, homework is a valuable tool that can enhance a child's educational experience, and I firmly believe that it should continue to be a part of a child's learning journey.
525;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child's development while others think that it is important for children to go to school.Discuss the advantages of both methods and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In regards to the notion 'it is important for children to go to school', there are two contrasting opinions of supporting it and also disagreeing with it. Schools are conceptually thought to be essential and compulsory for many parents while others may not despite of what the society says.There are people who suggest that going to school is indeed necessary for children and students as it enables them to develop social ability and make friends which will ultimately be useful in the future. Attending school, a microsom of society, itself already teaches young students how to interact with other people ouside of family tree. Those who did not attend school when they were young may have severly low EQ or lacking interaction ability. For instance, an adult who was studying at home might not know how to respect and share objects with others. By being enrolled in a school, children can make remarkable childhood memories that may help them in the future when they are in a slump or depression.On the other hand, some people may disagree to this notion as they think studying at home is far more effective. Their argument might be that going to school would be a waste of time as children usually play around at school. Teaching children can be much more efficient as transportation time and playing time can be eliminatied by not going to school. Furthermore, as children do not have to go out, there will not be any conflicts on bullying or fight with friends. They will not fall onto deviation such as smoking, drinking et cetera which are usually encountered at school due to bad friends. Also, money can be saved by teaching at home as uniforms, for example, do not have to purchased.All in all, although young students might have number of advantages by not going to school, it is nevertheless more important to attend school in a daily basis to improve their social ability and interaction with other people.;The debate surrounding the best method for a child's development has sparked intense discussion among parents and educators. While some argue that teaching children at home is the most effective approach, others believe that attending school is essential for a child's growth. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages of both methods and provide my own opinion.On the one hand, teaching children at home provides a personalized and flexible learning experience. Parents can tailor their child's education to their individual needs, interests, and learning style, allowing for a more effective learning process. Additionally, homeschooling provides a safe and comfortable environment, free from bullying and peer pressure, which can be detrimental to a child's emotional well-being. For instance, a friend of mine was homeschooled due to a medical condition and was able to thrive academically and socially without the added stress of a traditional school setting.On the other hand, attending school offers a wealth of benefits, including socialization, diversity, and access to resources and facilities. Schools provide children with the opportunity to interact with peers from various backgrounds, cultures, and socioeconomic statuses, fostering empathy, tolerance, and essential life skills. Furthermore, schools offer a range of extracurricular activities, sports, and clubs, which can help children develop new interests and talents. For example, I have seen firsthand how attending school has helped my younger siblings develop valuable friendships and a sense of belonging.In my opinion, attending school is the most beneficial approach for a child's development. While homeschooling can provide a personalized education, it often lacks the socialization and diversity that schools offer. Schools provide children with a well-rounded education, preparing them for an increasingly complex and interconnected world. Nevertheless, I acknowledge that homeschooling can be a viable option for certain children, such as those with special needs or circumstances that require a more tailored approach. Ultimately, the decision to homeschool or attend school depends on the individual child's needs and circumstances.
323;Write about the following topic.Some people believe women are better leaders than men. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is argued by some individuals that men aren't skilled enough as women in regard to leadership. This essay disagrees with the given statement as leadership skills are not depending on gender but are strongly related to people's personality and work experience.The role of a leader should not be stereotyped according to gender, for example, women might be considered more powerful than men because they could normally appear more organised and perfectionist. Indeed, several studies concerning leadership and the role of the leader, have demonstrated that some people have innate attitudes of a leader regardless of their gender. Some of those attitudes are related to active listening, emotional intelligence skills and great communication abilities. Thus, if effectively developed and fostered, those skills can support individuals to achieve higher roles in leadership and management.In the same way, the working experience also plays a crucial role in determining and further developing leadership skills. For example, a large number of women are still renouncing to their career paths in order to care for their families. Indeed, most of the women, apply for part-time roles which do not offer the opportunity to achieve a leadership role despite their abilities. For this reason, is difficult to affirm if women are better than men in leadership.To conclude, the role of a leader is shaped by innate characteristics and people's personalities regardless of their gender. Moreover, the poor presence of women employed in leadership roles does not create pieces of evidence to support such a point of view.;The notion that women are better leaders than men has sparked a heated debate in recent years. While some people subscribe to this idea, others disagree, arguing that leadership abilities are not determined by gender. In my opinion, I partially agree with the statement, as there are instances where women have demonstrated exceptional leadership skills, but I also believe that leadership is not exclusive to one gender.On the one hand, women often bring a unique set of skills to the table, such as empathy, communication, and multitasking abilities, which are essential for effective leadership. For example, Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany, has been praised for her calm and collective approach to crisis management, demonstrating exceptional leadership during the European financial crisis. Similarly, Jacinda Ardern, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, has shown remarkable leadership in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating a compassionate and decisive approach to governance.On the other hand, there are numerous examples of successful male leaders who have made significant contributions to their respective fields. Nelson Mandela, for instance, was a visionary leader who played a crucial role in ending apartheid in South Africa, demonstrating remarkable courage and leadership. Moreover, leadership is not solely determined by gender, but rather by an individual's skills, experience, and character.In conclusion, while I agree that women can make excellent leaders, I do not believe that they are inherently better than men. Leadership is a complex trait that cannot be reduced to a single factor, such as gender. Ultimately, what matters most is a leader's ability to inspire, motivate, and make informed decisions, regardless of their gender. By recognizing and valuing the diverse range of leadership styles and strengths, we can work towards creating a more inclusive and effective leadership landscape.
247;Write about the following topic.Some people feel that manufacturers and supermarkets have the responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging of goods. Others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Packing of goods has become a noticeable issue nowadays, especially in terms of environmental concerns and sustainable development of society. In order to reduce the amount of packaging, some people believe that manufacturers and supermarkets are more responsible for taking measures, while others insist that customers play a more critical role in reality. In my view, the effort needs to be made by the supplier and the consumer both to guarantee the achievement of the goal.On the one hand, the problem of over-packaging is often caused by commercial strategy. The supplier attempts to use beautiful packaging to make their products more attractive to customers. It is fairly easy to imagine that people would be more likely to choose a product decorated gorgeously than the same one with a plain appearance provided that there is thus no significant increase in price. Following that, producers would try to make every effort to obtain more competitive packaging for their products, which probably leads to excessive use of the wrap. Therefore, it is undoubtedly the duty of the producer to partake in reducing the amount of over-packaging by finding another way to improve the competitiveness of their products instead of merely attaching more value to their appearance.On the other hand, the behaviors of customers give rise to over-packaging as well. The more attention that people will pay to the appearance of goods, the more encouraged producers will be to exert themselves on wrapping. Moreover, the public awareness about the harmful influence of over-packaging is also profound in decreasing the amount of packaging. As customers take the problems caused by over-packaging into account, they would be more willing to purchase the goods with less packaging, which is a highly practical way to prevent producers from wrapping unduly.In conclusion, it is clear that suppliers and customers both are responsible for the trend of over-packaging. Therefore, the success of altering the situation needs the participation of them both.;The debate over who should take responsibility for reducing packaging waste has sparked intense discussion. On one hand, some people believe that manufacturers and supermarkets have a moral obligation to minimize the amount of packaging used for their products. This viewpoint is valid as these companies have the resources and expertise to design and implement sustainable packaging solutions. For instance, many companies have successfully introduced biodegradable or recyclable packaging materials, thereby significantly reducing waste. Additionally, manufacturers and supermarkets have the scale and influence to drive change throughout the supply chain, promoting environmentally friendly practices among their suppliers and partners.On the other hand, others argue that the onus lies with customers to make informed choices and avoid purchasing goods with excessive packaging. This perspective also holds merit, as consumer behavior and demand can drive market trends. When customers consistently choose products with minimal or eco-friendly packaging, it sends a clear signal to manufacturers and retailers that there is a market preference for sustainable options. For example, personal care companies have started offering refill options for their products, which not only reduces packaging waste but also offers customers a cost-effective alternative.In my opinion, both manufacturers and customers share the responsibility for reducing packaging waste. While manufacturers have the capability to innovate and implement sustainable packaging, customers have the power to influence market demand. Ultimately, a collaborative effort between producers, consumers, and policymakers is necessary to effectively tackle the issue of packaging waste. By working together and adopting a multifaceted approach, we can significantly reduce the environmental impact of packaging and promote a more sustainable future.
181;Write about the following topic.Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding change. Others, however, think that change is always a good thing.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people rather doing the same things over and over avoiding change, meanwhile others consider change as a positive thing. Some people are probably afraid of change and for this reason they prefer staying in the confort zone because it's something familiar. On the other hand, others believe that change is a good opportunity to grow and discover new things.Changing it's not for everybody, because there are people that doesn't like it, so they try to avoid it. Spending the whole life doing the same thing is not as bad as change for some people. This is probably linked to the fact that sometime change is something unknown. So, sometime people prefere to stay in their confort zone because even if it's not the best at least is something familiar. For example, people that hate their jobs but are stuck with it, is because they're too afraid to change it and land in a worse place or position. So they rather stay in that place because they're too afraid to lose it and end up worse. I believe that this is an understandable and common reason around people, however i believe that change can give more chances for improvement.Other people believes that change is always a positive thing. Changing is an opportunity to grow and discover new things, It's a chance to achieve something better and improve. There are people who doesn't like to be in the same place (phisically, economically or emotionally) and prefer changing. For instance, going to a new country because the idea of living in the same place forever is not charming enough, so find out new places to see, and places to feel confortable ,emotionally and economically for instance, is something that only people who are hungry enough of change would do it. I believe that sometime it's better risk it than live the same life everyday.In conclusion, the preference about change depends on people and wheter is beneficial or not depends on the different point of views and situations. I think, that change is important, everything change even if try to avoid it. So, it's better embrace it because no matter how things go it will leave you either with an experiece or with a lesson. So, in my opinion change is a good thing.;The debate about whether change is beneficial or detrimental has sparked intense discussion among individuals. On one hand, some people prefer to maintain a routine and avoid change, citing the comfort and security it provides. They argue that familiarity breeds stability and that altering one's life can lead to uncertainty and chaos. For instance, a person who has lived in the same town their entire life may feel a strong sense of community and belonging, and may be hesitant to relocate to a new city.On the other hand, others believe that change is always a good thing, as it brings new experiences, opportunities, and personal growth. They argue that a life without change becomes stagnant and mundane, leading to boredom and dissatisfaction. For example, a person who has never traveled abroad may feel inspired to explore new cultures and meet new people, leading to a broader perspective and increased confidence.In my opinion, I believe that change is essential for personal growth and development. While routine can provide comfort, it can also lead to complacency and stagnation. Change, whether it be a new job, a new hobby, or a new living situation, forces individuals to adapt and evolve, leading to increased resilience and self-awareness. Furthermore, change can bring new opportunities and experiences that can enrich one's life and provide a sense of fulfillment. For instance, a person who takes a risk and starts their own business may experience challenges, but also gain a sense of pride and accomplishment.In conclusion, while some people may prefer to avoid change, I firmly believe that change is a necessary and beneficial aspect of life. It brings new experiences, opportunities, and personal growth, leading to a more fulfilling and meaningful life. By embracing change, individuals can break out of their comfort zones and discover new aspects of themselves, leading to increased confidence and self-awareness.
149;Write about the following topic.Some people think living in big cities is bad for people’s health.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In the past decades, the rise of urbanization has brought trends of moving into the cities. While some people believe that the availability of resources and welfare in metropolises can outweigh the unhealthy environment, I strongly believe that the fancy infrastructures come in exchange for health sacrifice.To begin with, most megacities are overpopulated. With scarce resources and higher demands in every aspect, products and services received in these bustling locations usually come at a higher price, lower quality and longer waiting time. For example, it could take up to weeks or months to queue up for non-urgent medical services while it takes only a few days or even without booking in non-busy areas. Moreover, the nature of crowded areas accelerates the spreading of transmittable diseases during the pandemic.Another undeniable health factor for those residing in cities is pollution. Most cities come with traffic issues where there are exceeding amounts of cars which create air pollution. It is proved that, in long term, smog in the air could result in respiratory diseases such as lung cancer. Furthermore, the number of the city's population is equal to the extremely large amount of waste and without an appropriate waste management system, it could lead to several more problems. One of them is pests such as mice and bugs which are the perfect mediums for severe diseases such as rabies.All in all, urbanization has tremendous benefits to human society as a whole and is unavoidable in the present context. Thus, governments should focus on addressing these issues to ensure the sustainable progress of cities and the citizens' quality of life.;The notion that living in big cities is detrimental to people's health has sparked a heated debate. In my opinion, I partially agree with this statement. While big cities offer numerous benefits, such as access to advanced medical facilities and a wide range of job opportunities, they also pose significant health risks.On the one hand, large cities are often plagued by air and noise pollution, which can lead to respiratory problems and other health issues. For instance, a study conducted in Tokyo, Japan, found that the high levels of air pollution in the city were linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease among its residents. Additionally, the fast-paced and stressful lifestyle often associated with city living can take a toll on mental health, leading to anxiety and depression.On the other hand, big cities are also hubs for medical innovation and excellence, offering access to specialized healthcare services and cutting-edge treatments. Many cities also have an abundance of parks, green spaces, and recreational facilities, which provide residents with opportunities for physical activity and relaxation. For example, New York City's High Line, an elevated park built on an old rail line, provides a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of city life, promoting physical activity and mental well-being.In conclusion, while living in big cities can have negative impacts on people's health, it is not entirely bad. With the benefits of advanced medical care and opportunities for physical activity, city living can be healthy if one is mindful of the potential risks and takes steps to mitigate them. Ultimately, a balance between the benefits and drawbacks of city living is key to maintaining good health.

While some people believe that art is a vital subject for children to learn, others think it's a waste of time. In this essay, I will discuss both views and provide my opinion on the matter.On the one hand, some people think that art is a luxury that schools cannot afford, especially when there are more ""practical"" subjects like mathematics and science to focus on. They argue that art does not provide children with the necessary skills to succeed in the job market, and that it's a waste of time and resources. For instance, in some schools, art classes are often the first to be cut when budget constraints arise.On the other hand, I firmly believe that art is an essential subject for children to learn. Not only does it foster creativity and self-expression, but it also helps develop critical thinking skills, fine motor skills, and hand-eye coordination. Art classes provide children with an outlet to express themselves, build confidence, and explore their imagination. Moreover, art is an integral part of our culture and history, and learning about it helps children understand and appreciate the world around them. For example, art projects can help children learn about different historical periods, cultural movements, and social issues, making them more empathetic and open-minded individuals.In conclusion, while some people may think that art is a waste of time, I strongly believe that it's an essential subject for children to learn. Art classes provide a unique set of skills and benefits that cannot be replicated by other subjects. By incorporating art into school curriculums, we can raise a generation of creative, empathetic, and well-rounded individuals who are equipped to succeed in all areas of life."
221;Write about the following topic.Some people think that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is believed that responsibility for the rise in obesity in children is on government. I strongly disagree with this opinion. I think that state policy cannot lead to the people's obesity. Moreover, I am sure that only parents are responsible for their children diseases.First of all, it is important to say that government's actions can not be followed with the obesity. It is responsible only for control that all available products are not dangerous for people's health. Food that consist of a lot of fats do not put your health under the threat after the first consumption. Only overeating of this kind of food can be harmful for your health leading obesity. For instance, there is no government's responsibility if you go to the mall and buy 6 cans of beer providing health problem for yourself. I am sure that government is responsible only for making 1 can of beer acceptable for your health.Secondly, children's actions and potential consequences of these actions should be controlled by their parents. Obesity can be a result of a permanent overeating. Because of their age, chilldren cannot control themselves. That is why this responsibility goes on their parents. As it was mentioned before, there is no product that can be harmful for the healh after the first and the only consumption. There is no reason to condemn government because of the permanent consumption of any products. For example, child could eat 3 pieces of cake insted of 1 just because of his wish. In this case, his parents should stop him after the first one to avoid potential obesity.In conclusion, I would like to say that I do not see any reasons to say that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children. It has no responsibility for people's overeating and lack of parents' control over their children.;The increasing prevalence of obesity in children has sparked a heated debate about who is responsible for this trend. While some argue that the government is to blame, I partially disagree with this notion. In my opinion, the government does play a role, but it is not the sole responsible entity.On one hand, the government can be held accountable for the rise in childhood obesity due to its policies and regulations. For instance, the government can influence the food industry by setting standards for nutritional content and advertising practices. If the government fails to enforce strict regulations, companies may continue to promote unhealthy foods to children, contributing to the obesity epidemic. Furthermore, the government's budget allocation for physical education and recreational facilities in schools can also impact the amount of physical activity children engage in. Insufficient funding can lead to a lack of opportunities for children to exercise and stay active.On the other hand, I believe that parents and individuals also have a significant role to play in preventing childhood obesity. Parents have the responsibility to provide their children with a balanced diet and encourage physical activity. Moreover, schools and communities can also promote healthy lifestyles by offering sports programs, cooking classes, and other activities that promote wellness. For example, some schools have successfully implemented gardening programs, where children learn to grow and prepare their own fruits and vegetables, promoting healthy eating habits.In conclusion, while the government has a responsibility to create an environment that promotes healthy living, I do not think it is solely responsible for the rise in childhood obesity. It is a collective effort that requires the participation of parents, schools, communities, and individuals to educate and support children in making healthy choices. By working together, we can create a society that values and promotes the well-being of its youngest members.
565;Write about the following topic.Some people think that it is more beneficial to take part in sports which are played in teams, like football. But others think taking part in individual sports is better, like swimming. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"There are lots of benifits in both party of sports which is group sports and individual sports. Many argue that one is better than another. By analyzing my personal experience, both side advantages and disadvanteges will be discussed.Health, the main factor that make people doing the sport in some extent. Many sports help body to increase the metabolism and keep our figure look slim. For example, like swiming, the sport is well-known for beauty body buidling, many reaserch show that water pressure form muscle into more dynamic beautiful shape than any other sport regardless of safty issues which part of events were practice in open water.Compare to swiming, a group sport like soccer game need 22 players participate into the field. Average soccer player have very powerful core strenth, in order to compete in this match, soccer player need to wear certain protection to prevent from injury such as foot pad to reduce the impact from side kick from other players and ankel protector. Undoubtly, soccer players have most strong body among many sports. However, they are the group of people most likely get injuryed more frequently.Sport also can build trust and friendship between people. In this aspect, both individual sports and group sports are proven that partipating in group games or competing with another player on a 1v1 match can increase the improvement of sportsmanship between people. Like olympic motto, ""stonger, faster and higher"", a good sport can bring people together and compete each other in a fair and friendly enviornment. However, individual sport may get boring faster than group sports due to lack of competition.In conclusion, neither group sports nor individual sports are perfect in every aspects. It is important to found a sport suit for each individual personal interest. All kinds of sports always carry benifits with dangerous if people do not do it well.";The debate about whether team sports or individual sports are more beneficial has been ongoing for years. While some people believe that participating in team sports like football is more advantageous, others argue that individual sports like swimming are better. In this essay, I will discuss both views and provide my opinion.On the one hand, team sports offer numerous benefits. They promote camaraderie, teamwork, and communication among players. Team sports also teach individuals how to work towards a common goal, build trust, and rely on each other's strengths. For instance, in football, players need to coordinate their movements, support each other, and strategize together to win a game. This teamwork aspect of team sports can foster strong bonds among players and improve their social skills.On the other hand, individual sports like swimming provide a different set of benefits. They allow athletes to focus on their personal performance, set individual goals, and develop self-discipline. Individual sports also reduce the pressure of relying on others, enabling athletes to take full responsibility for their successes and failures. For example, a swimmer can concentrate on their own technique, pace, and endurance without worrying about their teammates' performance.In my opinion, team sports are more beneficial because they offer a unique combination of physical and social benefits. Participating in team sports can improve not only physical fitness but also social skills, emotional intelligence, and mental toughness. While individual sports have their advantages, team sports provide a more well-rounded experience that can benefit individuals in many aspects of life. Moreover, team sports often create a sense of community and belonging, which can be a powerful motivator for athletes to persevere and improve. Overall, I believe that team sports like football are more beneficial than individual sports like swimming, as they provide a broader range of benefits that can enhance both physical and emotional well-being.
189;Write about the following topic.Some people think that we should divide students based on their academic ability, while others think we should educate all students together. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people argue that students who have noticeable abilities and nice educational skills in academics should be separated during the learning process. The other says that it is no object who a better in education who not they should study together. I believe that it is terrible idea to include separation among students.On the one hand, when students with strong and weak academic abilities educate separately, teachers could control the learning process more thoroughly. In this way the teacher could give them more difficult tasks and focus on really relevant topics. A good example of this are private schools with fees and entering exams. It is the fact that there students in final classes have better knowledge than in common schools.On the other hand, when students with different skills educate together the strong students will help weak ones. In these classes there are standards and all students should follow them and there are opportunities to ask schoolmates how to solve some task correctly. The nice example of this is my school. If I did not know how to solve a task I would have a chance to wait for help from my more wise mate.In conclusion, although separate education will give a chance to learn a lot of difficult tasks and it helps teachers, the losing way of asking help if you do not know how to solve the task would be devastating for the educational process. In addition, it could be separated by abilities and wisdom, anyway it is an awful idea.;The debate about whether students should be divided based on their academic ability or educated together has been ongoing for years. On one hand, some people argue that dividing students based on their academic ability allows for more effective teaching and learning. This approach enables teachers to tailor their lessons to the specific needs of each group, resulting in better academic outcomes. For instance, gifted students can be challenged with advanced materials, while struggling students can receive extra support. This method can help prevent boredom and frustration, as students are learning with peers who share similar abilities.On the other hand, others believe that educating all students together promotes socialization, equality, and inclusivity. By learning together, students of different abilities can develop important life skills such as teamwork, communication, and empathy. Additionally, mixed-ability classes can help break down social barriers and stereotypes, as students learn to appreciate and value each other's strengths and weaknesses. For example, a student who excels in mathematics can help a peer who struggles with the subject, while the latter can assist the former in a different area, such as language arts.In my opinion, educating all students together is the more beneficial approach. Not only does it foster a sense of community and social responsibility, but it also prepares students for the real world, where people of diverse abilities and backgrounds work together. Moreover, with the right teaching strategies and resources, teachers can cater to the needs of all students, regardless of their academic ability. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and supportive learning environment that values and celebrates the unique strengths and talents of each individual. Ultimately, educating all students together is essential for promoting academic excellence, social cohesion, and personal growth.
569;Write about the following topic.Some teachers think that international student exchange would be beneficial for all teenage school students.Do you think its advantages will outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The international student exchange is getting more popular in many high schools in big cities. This operation brings many advantages which would be beneficial for teenager students. Though, here some disadvantages still exist.Firstly, I think one of disadvantages is that lack of supervision on the international exchange teenagers as they are living in other countries. In general speaking, the youths felt strange and inadaptable at initial period. They can’t speak well foreign language, can’t communicate well with other classmates or teachers, so they might feel alone and isolate from a new circumstance. If they can’t adjust themselves well to fit in with groups as soon as possible, they will encounter more difficult things, such as studying, social and daily routine. The worse situation is that they might give up their studying, even they will mislead them into crime.On the contrary, the advantages are far more than disadvantages. For example, youths will extend their horizons. They will see and know many new things what they never seen in domestic. They would easily accept those new things than adults, because youths have curiosities all long. Furthermore, the teenagers easier to make new friends in other countries, because they are always passion and single-minded. In order to communicate with different background students from all over the world, they must cultivate their social capacities harder than before. It is the best way to elevate their skills of the foreign language is communication. Moreover, through the different viewpoint collisions the international exchange students have gained multiple and scientific logics, which will have a profound impact at the rest their lives. However, I think the simplest advantage is that most the international exchange students have possessed with an excellent foreign language ability after then come back.At the end of my essay, I think it is not suit for all teenagers to be the international exchange students. Here the teenagers must accept some selection processes under the fair and effective principles.;The concept of international student exchange has garnered significant attention in recent years, with many educators believing it to be a highly beneficial experience for teenage school students. In my opinion, the advantages of such a program indeed outweigh the disadvantages, and I firmly believe that it can have a profoundly positive impact on the lives of young students.One of the primary advantages of international student exchange is the opportunity for cultural immersion and exchange. By living and studying in a foreign country, students can gain a deeper understanding of different cultures,societies and ways of life. This can broaden their perspectives, foster empathy and tolerance, and help them develop into more open-minded and globally aware individuals. For instance, a student from a conservative society who spends a semester in a liberal country may return home with a fresh outlook on social issues and a greater appreciation for diversity.Moreover, international student exchange programs can provide students with invaluable language skills and academic experiences. By studying in a foreign institution, students can improve their language proficiency, learn new teaching methods, and gain access to a wider range of academic resources. For example, a student who participates in a language exchange program in Japan may return home fluent in the language and equipped with skills that make them highly competitive in the job market.However, some may argue that international student exchange can be costly, logistically challenging and emotionally taxing for young students. Nevertheless, in my opinion, the benefits far outweigh these drawbacks. With careful planning, support from educators and host families, and a willingness to step out of their comfort zones, teenage students can thrive in international exchange programs and gain life-changing experiences that shape their futures. Overall, I strongly believe that international student exchange is an enriching experience that can empower teenage students with the skills, knowledge and perspectives necessary to succeed in an increasingly interconnected world.
1003;Write about the following topic.Some universities now offer their courses on the Internet so that people can study online.Is this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It has become a popular trend that many universities have sent online courses for people to acquire knowledge through the Internet, which makes it more and more available for people to gain valuable resources and improve themselves. From my perspective, such a trend contains much benefits and it is undoubtedly a positive development.On the one hand, people can have more access to their interested expertise and delve into related fields with the help of online courses offered by universities. It is comparatively hard and inconvenient for people to attend courses in the university if they are not college students. Luckily, with myriads of online courses which are usually free and of high quality, learners merely need to register and sign in to find out some interesting courses ranging from academic knowledge to practical skills, which can afford a challenging but exciting experience for those attend the lessons.On the other hand, it is a good way for the universities to improve the quality of the courses as well as make some adaptation to the content of the courses. In order for people outside the universities to acquire knowldege effectively, online courses should cater to people's preference to some extent. It is expectable that some courses which is of great necessity and closely connected with people's daily life would be popular. Thus, universities would therefore release more high-quality courses by innovating teaching skills to meet people's needs.In conlusion, I think online courses provided by universities can surely make a positive impact on society because people who have the desire to acquire knowledge can enjoy sufficient resources without boundaries, which enhances individual's rights to grasp knowledge and facilitates the improvement of higher education in the long run.;The emergence of online courses offered by universities has sparked a heated debate about its implications. In my opinion, this development is largely positive. One of the primary advantages of online courses is that they increase accessibility to education. Students from remote areas or those with physical disabilities can now access a wide range of courses without having to relocate or compromise their health. For instance, a friend of mine who lives in a rural area was able to enroll in a prestigious university's online program, which would have been impossible for her to attend in person.Another benefit of online courses is their flexibility. Students can now manage their study schedule around their work or family commitments, allowing them to balance multiple responsibilities. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for working professionals who want to enhance their skills or pursue further education without having to take a career break. Many online courses also offer self-paced learning, which enables students to learn at their own speed, reducing the pressure and stress associated with traditional classroom settings.However, some may argue that online courses lack the interpersonal interaction and hands-on experience that traditional classroom settings provide. While this is true, many universities are now incorporating virtual discussions, virtual labs, and other interactive tools to mitigate this limitation. Moreover, online courses often provide access to a global community of students and instructors, which can be a valuable resource for networking and learning from diverse perspectives.In conclusion, the availability of online courses is a positive development that has the potential to democratize access to education, increase flexibility, and provide a high-quality learning experience. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that online courses will become even more sophisticated and effective, further bridging the gap between traditional and online learning.
531;Write about the following topic.The issue of gay marriage remains controversial. Some people think that this trend has adverse effects on the society while others believe that it is seen as a natural trend and right for people to choose this type of marriage. Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Recently, many countries have legalized gay marriage. However, there are many people who do not agree with that, and claim that it has a bad influence on the education of children, and the evolution of society. However, in my opinion, I think it is a good opportunity for homosexual people as they are now understood by others, and have the right to have children despite of their situation.To begin, there are many parents, for example, who tend to believe that because of the access to gay marriage, their children will find it normal to fall in love with a person from the same sex. As a result, more and more children will become homosexual, which is unconventional as far as the parents are concerned. However, I believe that it is not because children understand the fact that being gay is normal, that they will be influenced by this. In fact, they will be able to compassionate for people who struggle to express their homosexuality, so they will help them to feel more comfortable with that. Moreover, they will be more open-minded which is very important for children development.Secondly, many other people are convinced that gay marriage will inevitably tends towards a decrease of the young population as gay individuals can not have their own kids. As a consequence, This phenomenon represents a threat because young people will not be able to take over for the future. However, I am not of this opinion. I think that such a decrease in young people population will not occur as the vast majority of the world's population in not homosexual. Moreover, by allowing gay marriage, gay couples will be able to adopt children. Indeed, due to the fact that they are not able to give rise to new-born, they can adopt children who are abandonned, and give them the opportunity to live in a new family with good conditions.To conclude, I firmly believe that gay marriage is a good opportunity for the development of the society. Indeed, not only it makes children more open-minded, which is important for their own development, but also gives for those who are unfortunately abandonned, a safe environment to thrive in.;The issue of gay marriage has sparked intense debate in recent years, with some people vehemently opposing it, while others passionately supporting it. In my opinion, gay marriage should be legal, as it is a fundamental human right for individuals to choose their partner, regardless of their sexual orientation.One of the primary arguments against gay marriage is that it undermines traditional family values and societal norms. However, this argument is based on outdated and discriminatory attitudes towards the LGBTQ+ community. On the other hand, legalizing gay marriage promotes equality, acceptance, and inclusivity, which are essential for a healthy and progressive society. For instance, countries like Canada, the UK, and Australia have already legalized gay marriage, and it has had a positive impact on the mental health and well-being of LGBTQ+ individuals.Furthermore, denying same-sex couples the right to marry is a form of discrimination, which can have severe consequences on their emotional and psychological well-being. It can also lead to social isolation and stigma, making it difficult for them to integrate into society. On the contrary, legalizing gay marriage can help to promote social cohesion, reduce prejudice, and encourage acceptance of diversity.In conclusion, gay marriage should be legal, as it is a matter of human rights, equality, and personal freedom. It is essential to recognize that love and commitment know no boundaries, and individuals should be free to choose their partner, regardless of their sexual orientation. By legalizing gay marriage, we can create a more inclusive, accepting, and equitable society, where everyone has the opportunity to live their life with dignity and respect. Ultimately, it is crucial to prioritize love, acceptance, and equality over outdated societal norms and prejudices.
293;Write about the following topic.The most important function of music is that it helps people reduce stress. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many today have come to the conclusion that the most significant effect on people of music is to relieve stress. While I agree that music also has more important positive functions other than reducing stress.On the one hand, I have to admit that music is a good way to reduce stress and it do plays an important role in our daily life. A good example of this can be seen in Shanghai, where has a large number of single karaoke rooms in the office buildings. As we all know, compared to the others cities in China, the people living in Shanghai face more stress, like the surprisingly high price of house and the fierce competition of work. Those public karaoke rooms, which were provided by the government for the public, become a good place for people to enjoy the music and have fun.On the other hand, for many people, music is an ideal career to persue in their life, like the job as an accountant, which can bring them with incomes and improve their living standard. For example, the TV programs related to music attract more and more people to participate in, like The Voice. Most of the participants wish to show their excellent peformance in music through these stages with the purpose of having access to more business opportunities and making more money at the same time. It is undeniable that the following income would be exponential increased than before if they succeed finally.In conclusion, it is not doubt that music is very essential for us, not only for its spiritual meanings, but also for its more important role in our society which could allow the person to relise their dream while creating more economical benefits.;The notion that the most important function of music is to help people reduce stress is a widely debated topic. While I agree that music has a significant impact on alleviating stress, I do not entirely concur that it is the most crucial function of music. Music has a multitude of purposes, including expression, entertainment, and cultural identity, which are equally essential.On the one hand, it is undeniable that music has a profound effect on stress reduction. Research has shown that listening to calming music can lower cortisol levels, stress hormones, and promote relaxation. For instance, studies have demonstrated that patients undergoing surgery who listened to soothing music experienced reduced anxiety and required less anesthesia. Personally, I have experienced the calming effects of music during exam periods, when listening to classical music helped me to focus and alleviate exam-related stress.On the other hand, music serves as a powerful medium for self-expression, cultural preservation, and social commentary. It has the ability to evoke emotions, create a sense of belonging, and challenge social norms. Music festivals, concerts, and performances bring people together, fostering a sense of community and social bonding. Moreover, music has been a driving force behind social movements, inspiring change and promoting unity.In conclusion, while music indeed plays a vital role in stress reduction, its importance extends far beyond this singular function. Music's diverse purposes, including expression, entertainment, and cultural preservation, render it a multifaceted and essential part of human experience. Therefore, I only partially agree with the statement, acknowledging the significance of music in stress alleviation while recognizing its broader and more profound impact on human life.

Finding solutions to reduce traffic is very crucial. I totally agree that if people travel less from home to work or to education or even for shopping can reduce the amount of traffic. With the covid 19 outbreak pandemic we saw how much the working from home and using the zoom application for studying reduced the traffic in cities. People now are using online for shopping too. We know that traffic can be reduced if less consumers are using the roads. However, I dont agree that this is the only way to reduce traffic. Other strategies to reduce traffic are :1. Planning the roads and building the road bridges in a smarter way with special lanes for public transportation.2. Encourging people to use light trails, public transportations and to use car pools.3. Building special lanes for motorcycles and electric bikes.4. The governoment can put more regulations regarding how many cars each family can have.5. Increasing the vehicles prices and reduce the public transportation tickets.6. Educate people on the consequences of traffic and how it can inadverntly affect their life.7. Encourge people to walk more and to choose a work that is close to your home.As I mentioned above there are many strategies that can help in reducing tranffic and only by reducing the need for people to travel from home. I think i people travel less it abviously can reduce the traffic but we need a multi strategy with the collaberations of many sectors to successfly reduce traffic in cities.;The notion that reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education, or shopping is the only way to decrease traffic congestion in cities is a debatable topic. While I agree that minimizing the necessity for daily commutes can alleviate traffic, I do not entirely concur that it is the sole solution.On one hand, reducing the need for people to travel can significantly decrease traffic volume. For instance, implementing flexible work arrangements, as seen in the rise of remote work, can lead to fewer cars on the road. Similarly, online education platforms and virtual shopping experiences can also diminish the need for physical travel. Cities like Tokyo and Singapore have already adopted such measures, as they encourage employees to work from home and provide online services for various needs, resulting in reduced traffic congestion.On the other hand, there are other effective ways to mitigate traffic congestion. Improving public transportation systems, investing in pedestrian-friendly and cyclist-friendly infrastructure, as well as implementing smart traffic management systems can also greatly reduce traffic. Cities like Copenhagen and Vancouver have successfully incorporated these strategies, showcasing a decrease in traffic without solely relying on minimizing travel needs. Furthermore, traffic congestion is often a symptom of deeper issues such as urban planning and lack of green spaces, which also need to be addressed.In conclusion, though reducing the need for daily commutes can contribute to decreasing traffic congestion, it is not the only solution. A multi-faceted approach, including enhancements in public transportation, urban planning, and infrastructure, is necessary to effectively alleviate traffic in cities. By acknowledging and implementing a combination of these strategies, cities can work towards creating more sustainable, efficient, and less congested environments for their residents.
235;Write about the following topic.There are several factors that motivate people to stay in the workforce, and money is the most important reason/factor. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The topic of motivation for work has merely failed to be discussed. Someone elaborate that the most significant factor is money while others suppose it is not. As far as I am concerned, although money is of great importance, it cannot always be the most valuable one.Undoubtedly, money can be a crucial factor to diminish the financial burden of families, especially for those who were born in a poverty-stricken area. To be more specific, only by earning sufficient money can they raise their later generations and keep the elderly. Provided that they cannot find a decent job that allow them to own some disposable money, it would add insult to injury.However, there are a great number of factors that may be considered as worthwhile to be the motivation of stay in the staff by some people. First of all, being in the workforce can help to strengthen an individual’s interpersonal skills. It is widely acknowledged that there are a colossal number of activities as well as team programmes that require people to collaborate, compromise and compete with the others. Thus, individuals will tend to learn some social skills and become gregarious and sociable, which can help them better adapt themselves to the mainstream society. In addition, people may also get a chance to broaden their horizons and lay a firm basis for future development by staying in the workforce. For instance, under the circumstance that numerous companies may provide the staff with the opportunity to go abroad and get involved in some international programs, people are able to get access to different cultures. As a result, people can develop panning-for-gold thinking rather than sponge-feeding thinking in the process of understanding divergent cultures, which can be beneficial for their future careers.In conclusion, although money is valuable for individuals to be in the workforce, there are many other factors that cannot be overlooked. Only by treating all the factors rationally can we enjoy the pleasure rather than pressure.;The notion that money is the most important motivator for people to stay in the workforce is a widely debated topic. While I agree that financial compensation is a significant factor, I disagree that it is the sole or most important reason. In my opinion, there are several other factors that play a crucial role in motivating individuals to remain in the workforce.On one hand, money is undoubtedly a key motivator, as it provides a means of survival and allows individuals to support themselves and their families. Many people work to earn a living and achieve financial stability, which is a fundamental human need. For instance, a person working in a low-paying job may be motivated to stay in the workforce solely for the financial benefits, as they may not have alternative means of supporting themselves.On the other hand, I believe that other factors, such as personal fulfillment, job satisfaction, and a sense of purpose, are equally important motivators. Many individuals stay in the workforce because they find meaning and enjoyment in their work, or because they feel a sense of accomplishment and recognition. For example, a teacher may be motivated to stay in the workforce because they find joy in educating and inspiring their students, rather than just for the financial rewards. Similarly, a person working in a creative field may be motivated by the opportunity to express themselves and bring new ideas to life, rather than just for the money.In conclusion, while money is an important factor in motivating people to stay in the workforce, I disagree that it is the most important reason. Other factors, such as personal fulfillment, job satisfaction, and a sense of purpose, play a significant role in motivating individuals to remain in the workforce. Ultimately, a combination of financial and non-financial factors motivates people to stay in the workforce, and it is the interplay between these factors that determines an individual's decision to remain in or leave the workforce.
115;Write about the following topic.To meet the growing need for food to support an increasing population, a country should make use of edible insects as a food source. However, some people believe that insects are not only unhealthy but harvesting them will also negatively affect nature. What are the benefits and drawbacks of eating insects?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some countries and culture already utilize insects as part of food source. As such, it can be relatively inexpensive to consume insects - which are often freely found in certain environments and do not take much skill to be collected, killed and consumed - as compared to the cost and manual labor involved in raising animal livestock, butchering, as well as preparing the meat for consumption. Similarly agriculture also involves consistent manual labor, and has costs associated with it, including for machinery and materials needed. However, people may be against the idea of consuming insects due to the novelty of it, and they may also feel disgust around it. As the prompt states, some may find it unhealthy. Harvesting insects on purpose will also require some physical and psychological work - but the benefit here is that it may be easier than harvesting large animals or cultivating crops.I have never consumed an insect product - and my father has mentioned to me that had lived in such-and-such country, I would not be so scared of cockroaches - viewing them as a food source. He intended this to be an ironic comment, meant to comfor me somewhat due to my strong aversion to cockroaches. However, he may be correct! For individuals socialized in such a society, their aversion to roaches may be lower than mine. Hence, part of the issue here is socialization and accepting this new food norm, should it be novel to the individual and/or the country.I have tried an octopus for the first time when I was around 20 years old - as I was curious about this dish called Takoyaki, and had heard good reviews of it. It was not unpleasant to eat the ocotpus, per se, but I likely will not go back to it. All in all, new experiences, including consumption of new types of food, may create strong aversion at first, but once dip your toes into it, so to speak, it may be tamer than the experience you were expecting - even if you never go back to eating it again.;The world's population is projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, putting a strain on traditional food sources. To address this issue, some experts suggest that edible insects could be a viable alternative. While some people are skeptical about the health and environmental implications of entomophagy, or the practice of eating insects, there are several benefits and drawbacks to consider.On the one hand, edible insects offer a sustainable and nutritious food source. Insects such as crickets, mealworms, and grasshoppers are rich in protein, micronutrients, and fiber. They also require significantly less land, water, and feed to produce compared to traditional livestock. For instance, it is estimated that producing one kilogram of beef requires around 1,000 liters of water, whereas producing one kilogram of crickets requires only one liter. Additionally, insect farming can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote eco-friendly agriculture.On the other hand, there are concerns about the health and environmental impacts of insect harvesting. Some people believe that insects may contain allergens, bacteria, or toxins that could harm human health. Moreover, large-scale insect harvesting could disrupt ecosystems and lead to the decline of beneficial insect species. For example, the over-harvesting of wild insects could have a negative impact on pollination and decomposition processes.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the health and environmental implications of eating insects, the benefits of entomophagy cannot be ignored. With proper farming and processing practices, edible insects can provide a nutritious and sustainable food source. Governments, researchers, and farmers must work together to develop guidelines and regulations that ensure the safe and environmentally-friendly production of insect-based foods. By exploring this alternative protein source, we can help meet the growing demand for food while promoting sustainable agriculture and reducing our environmental footprint.
131;Write about the following topic.With the improvements in today’s health care, society has to care for more and more elderly people.Do you feel that society will be able to cope with the increase in numbers of elderly people today and how can it be managed?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;I believe that all improvements in health care increase the number of elderly people, but those improvements also brings benefities in an way to care then.First of all, looking for a financial perspective, in generaly way, people became capable to work for a bigger period, getting retired older. So they could contributed more for any pension plan or those kind of program. We need to guarantee that our next governants will be capable to redesign the retire's program in an way to guarantee those beneffits to whole population.Looking by a health care perspective, all the improvments and medicine advance, it brings the possibilite to have a good life even allthough the years.For instance, we can see many people that healed from a bad ill like cancer or other ones and have a good life nowadays.This is the reason that elderly people is not a problem to our society, but in fact their represents more knowledge and we have all tecnology to take care about theirselfs.In other way we can see that our society open more space and are more concern with elderly population. We can see some places speciallyzed to take care of their and also a kind of intertainement focused on them, like some hotels, restauurants, clinics.In whole way our society are looking for treaty our elderly society in a decent way, respect them, make a enviroment friendly for their deficient and any dificult of mobility and any other issue that we need to cope to guarantee their activities.;"The advancements in healthcare have led to a significant increase in human lifespan, resulting in a growing elderly population. As a consequence, society is faced with the challenge of caring for a larger number of older adults. In my opinion, society will be able to cope with the increase in numbers of elderly people, but it will require careful planning, management, and allocation of resources.One of the primary concerns is the financial burden of caring for the elderly. With a larger proportion of the population requiring healthcare and social services, governments and healthcare systems will need to adapt to meet the demand. For instance, Japan, a country with a rapidly aging population, has implemented innovative solutions such as robotic caregivers and elderly-friendly infrastructure to support its older citizens. Similarly, other countries can learn from Japan's experience and develop strategies to manage the financial and logistical challenges of caring for the elderly.Moreover, societal attitudes towards aging and elderly care need to shift. By promoting intergenerational relationships, community engagement, and volunteer programs, we can foster a sense of responsibility and compassion towards older adults. For example, many communities have established ""adopt-a-senior"" programs, where younger individuals befriend and assist elderly neighbors, providing emotional support and practical help. Such initiatives not only benefit the elderly but also enrich the lives of the younger participants.In conclusion, while the increase in elderly population presents significant challenges, I believe that society can cope with it by adopting a multifaceted approach. This includes investing in healthcare infrastructure, promoting community engagement, and fostering a culture of respect and care for older adults. By learning from examples such as Japan and implementing innovative solutions, we can ensure that our societies are equipped to support and empower the growing elderly population."
933;Write about the following topic.Young people in the modern world seem to have more power and influence than any previous young generation.Why is this the case?What impact does this have on the relationship between old and young people?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"In modern times, the younger generation appear to be more powerful and influencial compared to the generations in times past. I believe this is as a result of younger people being more ascertive, stepping up to question and change existing societal norms and archaic cultures. At first, this may negatively affect their relationship with the older generation as a result of how unfamiliar they are to these changes but subsequently, the tension is bound to resolve, when the older generations come to accept these changes.To begin with, it is an open truth that young people these days tend to be very bold and outspoken and unlike their predecessors, are better at questioning norms that do not sit right with them and even going an extra mile to change these norms or cultures. A good example of this is seen in women empowerment and rights activism. In my part of the world, some years back, it was believed that a woman's place is in the kitchen and her sole job was to birth and rear children, therefore, women were not allowed to be educated or have paying jobs. Women in the older generation complied to this because it was the norm, but this is not the case in modern times, because many young women opposed to it and now, homes are even headed by women; the power of activism.Many people in the older generation are not familiar with young people being more outspoken and this is understandable because in their time, they were taught to only follow rules and not to question them. Therefore the fact that young people have become more outspoken and powerful is foreign to them and just like every human nature, whatever is foreign or different is automatically hated. As a result, there is likely going to be a tension between the 2 generations, however, with constant advocation and learning the tension is bound to resolve. For example, going back to women's rights activism, at the start, many older people were not on board as they did not think it was normal, however, there are now a lot of older people who have become activists.In conclusion, I believe that the power and influence the younger generation has is as a result of their ascertiveness and will to effect changes in their societies and even though it may cause a negative relationship with the older generation at first, subsequently, their differences is likely to be ironed out when the older generation learns to accept these changes.";The modern world has indeed empowered young people with unprecedented power and influence. One major reason for this phenomenon is the advent of social media and the internet. These platforms have given young individuals a voice, a space to express themselves, and a means to connect with others across the globe. As a result, they are now able to mobilize, organize, and advocate for causes they believe in, thereby exerting significant influence on societal issues.Another factor contributing to the enhanced power of young people is the changing nature of work and education. With the rise of entrepreneurship, freelancing, and online learning, young individuals can now pursue their passions and interests without being confined to traditional structures. This autonomy has enabled them to innovate, create, and lead in various fields, from technology and arts to social activism and politics.The impact of this shift on the relationship between old and young people is multifaceted. On one hand, it has bridged the generational gap, as young people's fresh perspectives and ideas are being sought after by older generations. For instance, many companies now actively seek input from younger employees to stay innovative and competitive. On the other hand, it has also created tensions, as some older individuals may feel threatened by the rising influence of the young or struggle to understand their values and modes of communication.In conclusion, the increased power and influence of young people in the modern world can be attributed to the digital revolution and the evolving landscape of work and education. This development has the potential to foster intergenerational collaboration and understanding, but it also requires effort and openness from both younger and older generations to navigate the changing dynamics of their relationship. By embracing and learning from each other, both age groups can harness the benefits of this shift and create a more inclusive and progressive society.
351;Write about the following topic:In many countries, not enough students study science subjects. What are the causes? What will be the effect on society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, there are many courses available to take, from arts that include theatre and music to scientific topics such as mathemathics, physics, chemistry, biology and medicine. There is an evidence that the amount of students willing to learn science subjects is not sufficient. In this essay I will discuss the causes of the issue and the possible effect on society.There are several casues for the fact that students tend to skip science subjects. First, studying science can be hard and exhausting. The complexity of some subjects such as math and physics requires from the student to study many hours at home. Secondly, there are students who do not only find those courses difficult, but also get low marks even after studying long hours. As for chemistry classes, some courses include labratory lessons which may not appeal to some students.The importance of people having knowledge in science is great. The society relies on science on a daily basis. For instance, doctors who study medicine, must know mathematics, biology and chemistry well, because biology is relevant to the patient's body. In addition, doctors prescribe medications so they must know chemistry well. Another example is architects whose job is to plan and design buildings. Without a proper knowledge in physics, they could not plan buildings.Discussing those facts, studying science can be challenging. However, it is vital for the society that students will study science. Without doctors, nurses, scientists and other professions that rely on science, the health of the society might be effected negatively.;The dearth of students pursuing science subjects is a pressing concern in many countries. One of the primary causes of this trend is the perceived difficulty of science subjects, which deters many students from opting for them. Additionally, the lack of qualified and inspiring teachers in these fields can make the subjects seem unappealing and inaccessible to students. Furthermore, the emphasis on rote memorization rather than hands-on experimentation and critical thinking in science education can also stifle students' interest and creativity.The effects of this trend on society will be far-reaching and profound. A dwindling number of science graduates will lead to a shortage of skilled professionals in fields such as medicine, technology, and engineering, which are essential for driving innovation and economic growth. For instance, countries like Japan and South Korea, which have invested heavily in science education, have experienced rapid technological advancements and economic prosperity. In contrast, countries with a weak science education system will struggle to keep pace with the demands of a rapidly changing world.If this trend continues, society will suffer from a lack of expertise in critical areas, leading to decreased competitiveness and stagnation. To mitigate this, governments and educational institutions must work together to revamp science education, making it more engaging, accessible, and relevant to students' lives. This can be achieved by incorporating more practical and project-based learning, as well as providing students with opportunities to interact with professionals in science fields. By doing so, we can inspire and equip the next generation of scientists, innovators, and leaders to tackle the complex challenges of the 21st century.
1185;Write about the following topic:Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Poverty has been always a major issue around the world. Due to viruses, natural disasters, and poor management in the country and overpopulation, each day the poverty increases. In addition, some developed countries ignore the help or just give a temporary solution. Poverty has a great effect on the income that can lead to serious problems.To begin with, developed countries shouldn't only support with financial aid, as that kind of solution will not help the people. In my opinion, rich countries can stop poverty in such way to look for the natural resources of the poor country and to help and develop its resources. For example, in Africa they are famous for their large area of land. A rich country can take this opportunity to implement a long-term plan to benefit and fight poverty, such as to start expanding the lands of agriculture to use their natural resources such as cocoa, rice, and coffee. Furthermore, this idea can also help the people of the country where they can work on the land and be employed.Also, developed countries can donate and build health care centers and schools to prevent the dangerous disease from spreading. Schools can empower children to grow up and help the country's economy to rise and to fight poverty.In conclusion, developed countries can unite and discuss this significant concern rather than helping with financial support as poverty is taking the lives of many children. Poor countries just need better solutions and understanding from the world to prevent such problems from continuing to happen.;The notion that rich countries should provide alternative forms of assistance to poorer nations, rather than financial aid, has sparked intense debate. While I agree that monetary aid alone may not be sufficient to eradicate poverty, I also believe that it can be a vital component of a comprehensive development strategy.On the one hand, financial aid can have numerous drawbacks. For instance, it can create dependency, undermine local economies, and even be misused by corrupt governments. Furthermore, aid can also distort market incentives, leading to inefficient allocation of resources. For example, in some African countries, food aid has been known to undercut local farmers, making it harder for them to compete in the market. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider alternative forms of assistance, such as technical expertise, education, and infrastructure development.On the other hand, financial aid can be a crucial lifeline for countries struggling with poverty, conflict, or natural disasters. It can provide immediate relief, stabilize economies, and support vital social services like healthcare and education. For example, after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, financial aid from developed countries was essential in providing emergency assistance and supporting the reconstruction efforts. In such situations, financial aid can be a necessary stopgap measure to prevent humanitarian crises.In conclusion, while I agree that developed countries should consider alternative forms of assistance, I do not think that financial aid should be entirely ruled out. A balanced approach, combining financial aid with technical assistance, capacity building, and investment in human capital, is likely to be more effective in addressing poverty and promoting sustainable development. Ultimately, the most effective form of assistance will depend on the specific needs and context of each poor country, and a flexible, adaptable approach is required to address the complex challenges of global poverty.
343;Write about the following topic:Some people believe that it is important to spend a lot of money on family celebrations. While others think it is a waste of money. Discuss both views.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Spending money in family celebrations can be seen as a way of appreciating where one comes from. Although some people say it is a total waste of money, l assert that it is wiser.To begin with, many people feel that it is of no importance to consume money on family gatherings. This is because people usually have more pressing issues in life like urgent health cases that require money. Also, some struggle to provide basic needs for their families, for example, tuitions, decent meals and shelter. For these reasons, it seems using money on family gatherings is just a luxury.Despite the merits of the arguments above, although many say it is wasteful to financially cater for family parties, l assert that it is crucial. One reason is that, it unites families and a sweet spirit is maintained if family members are recognised for their special days such as wedding anniversaries, birthdays and graduations where money is spent. Further, appreciation to others within the family cannot be expressed in many ways without forking out some money.Furthermore, money has to be spent on family get togethers where everyone is in a joyous mood so that people can catch up and release stresses from their straining personal lives. What is more, culture, closeness and love is easily displayed when families come together for such celebrations and use money for their own satisfaction. For instance, when my childhood birthdays were celebrated, l felt so much loved and l still cherish the memories as l vividly can recall.To conclude, although others feel that it is money consuming to fund family gatherings, l advocate that it is a wiser option. Should this be the case, love within families would not wax cold and family members would feel more appreciated.;The debate about whether it is essential to spend a significant amount of money on family celebrations has sparked a lot of discussion. On the one hand, some people believe that splurging on family celebrations is vital as it creates lasting memories and strengthens family bonds. For instance, a grand wedding or a milestone birthday party can be a once-in-a-lifetime experience that brings together relatives and friends, fostering a sense of togetherness and joy. Moreover, expensive gifts or lavish decorations can add to the excitement and make the occasion even more special.On the other hand, others argue that spending a lot of money on family celebrations is a waste of resources. They contend that the same amount of money could be used for more practical purposes such as saving for a family member's education or a down payment on a house. Additionally, some people may feel pressured into spending more than they can afford, leading to financial stress and debt. For example, a modest and intimate gathering can be just as meaningful and enjoyable as an extravagant one, without the burden of hefty expenses.In my opinion, both views have merit, and the decision to spend a lot on family celebrations depends on individual circumstances and priorities. While it is true that special occasions deserve to be marked with fanfare, it is also important to be mindful of one's financial situation and not compromise on more essential needs. Ultimately, what matters most is the love and connection shared among family members, not the price tag attached to the celebration. A balanced approach that considers both the emotional value and the financial implications can help families create meaningful and enjoyable celebrations without breaking the bank.
1199;Write about the following topic:Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Is competition instructive or toxic for children? There is a debate around this topic. There are those who believe that a sense of competition should be supported. On the other standpoint, there are those who believe that rather that compete children have to learn how to co-operate. I believe that supporters of competicions are partly right but also that co-operation between children is essential. The two strategy can be taken together to give to childrens all the tools they need to became useful adults.On the one hand, there are people who believe that to compete is essential for the growth of children. They believe that competitions rise the ambitions of children. They develop certain attitudes thanks to which they will have always bigger dreams and desire. The idea, therefore, is that children who have grown making competiions will became important managers because of their instinctive desire to be winners and successful persons. It is true that competitions permit childrens to develop their ambitions and to do the best they can in order to win. However, I strongly believe that a good understanding of the aim of competitions should be taught before they start to compete. Indeed, children have to understand the instructive role of competition and how manage the possible distructive consequences that could derive if a child is not ready to lose. Children should start a competition being aware of the possibility of lose and the possibility to win. I believe that is important to stimulate children in doing competitions but teaching them the important role of defeats and the role of coperation. This lead me to analyse the second standpoint.There are, indeed, people who dislike competitions at all. They believe they are toxic for the growth of children. According to them, it is negative to teach children to be against between each other. Rather, children should learn how to work together and co-operate. Surely, co-operation is a vital skill in workplaces. The ability to work in team is one of the most searched by different businesses. To learn how to work together means for children to understand their role in a group and also to think about the ideas that should support the team itself. Co-operation then permits children to develop fundamental social skills. However, co-operation alone is not enough for children's instruction. I believe that co-operation is possible just if a child is also learning how to work and produce something alone. Children, in order to advances ideas and give a good support in a team, have to learn to be ambitious and this is possible thanks to competitions.In conclusion, I believe that an instruction in which single competitions as well as team-works are encouraged is the most useful and productive in order to grow up efficient adults.;The debate about whether to encourage competition or cooperation in children has been ongoing for years. On one hand, some people believe that fostering a sense of competition in children is essential for their development. They argue that competition drives children to work harder, achieve more, and strive for excellence. This, in turn, prepares them for the competitive world they will face as adults. For instance, schools that encourage competitive sports and academic competitions often produce high-achieving students who are better equipped to succeed in their future careers.On the other hand, others believe that teaching children to cooperate rather than compete is more beneficial. They argue that cooperation promotes teamwork, values, and social skills, which are essential for building strong relationships and achieving common goals. By working together towards a shared objective, children learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses, and develop empathy and understanding. For example, a classroom project that requires students to work in groups to achieve a common goal can help them develop essential collaboration and communication skills.In my opinion, I believe that a balance between competition and cooperation is the most effective approach. While competition can drive children to achieve more, excessive competition can lead to stress, anxiety, and a focus on individual success rather than collective achievement. On the other hand, cooperation can promote teamwork and social skills, but may not provide the necessary drive for children to push themselves to achieve their full potential. By incorporating both competitive and cooperative elements into their upbringing, children can develop a strong work ethic, teamwork skills, and a sense of social responsibility, ultimately becoming more useful and well-rounded adults.
397;Write about the following topic:Some people think that hosting an international sports event is good for the country, while some people think it is bad. Discuss both views and state your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;International sports events are one of the most trendy interactions at any hosting country. Depending on the hoster, the events could represent a virtue or a slip. This dependence is associated with the costs, logisitcs, marketing, etc. I tend to be of the opinion, that the virtues outweigh the disadvantages and that they shall be considered as opportunities to exploit.Some people think of the international sport events as being disadvantageous, because for example of being a pressure on the countries' infrastructure as well as the provided services and facilities. Another reason might emerge as some countries also might not be well-suited for such events. For instance, despite spending a big budget on the organisation of the event, the lack of qualified personnel or needed objects and materials shall cause a massive distruction of the hostees' experiences.The other perpective of the usages and utilization of such events could be clear through the massive amount of virtues, which these events normally brings to the hosting countries. For example, these events are regularly sponsored from international organisation, which provide the financial means not for only the logisitcs of the events, but additionally fees for the hosters. Furthermore, the financial benefits shall not stop by the provided fees through the owning organisation, but also the global or regional branding of such country will affect the tourism and the local service providers absolutely positive.Concluding, international sport events could be absolutely virtous, if the hosting countries were to implement their strategies successfully. Should such countries be willing to give the event the raw focus on the organisation and the user-experience, that would absolutely lead to massive benefits financially, marketing-wise and from intercultural perspective.;The debate surrounding the benefits and drawbacks of hosting an international sports event has sparked intense discussion among individuals. On one hand, some people believe that hosting such an event can have a profoundly positive impact on a country. For instance, it can boost tourism, create jobs, and stimulate economic growth. The influx of visitors and media attention can also showcase a country's culture, history, and natural beauty, potentially attracting future investments and visitors. The 2008 Beijing Olympics,,assistant, and the 2012 London Olympics are exemplary cases where hosting international sports events generated significant revenue and put the countries on the global map.On the other hand, others argue that hosting an international sports event can have adverse effects. The exorbitant costs associated with building and maintaining state-of-the-art infrastructure, such as stadiums and facilities, can be a substantial burden on a country's economy. Moreover, the event may divert funds away from essential public services like healthcare and education. For example, the 2014 World Cup in Brazil led to widespread protests due to the perceived misallocation of funds towards the event rather than towards addressing the country's social and economic issues.In my opinion, hosting an international sports event can be beneficial for a country if managed prudently. With careful planning and budgeting, the benefits of increased tourism, job creation, and international exposure can outweigh the costs. Furthermore, investing in infrastructure can have long-term benefits for the country's development, such as improved transportation systems and sports facilities for the local community. However, it is crucial for the host country to prioritize its existing commitments to public services and ensure that the event does not come at the expense of its citizens' well-being. Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers both the economic and social implications can make hosting an international sports event a valuable opportunity for growth and development.
1412;You can get up-to-date news from the radio, TV and the Internet. Which kind of media do you think is the best to get the news?;Nowadays, there are several channels to get news, such as the radio, TV, newspapers and the Internet. I think the Internet is the best among these. .Since its invention, the Internet has been booming as a prospective industry. Not only because it is a combination of text, audio and video, but also due to its . It has threatened the domination of spreading news of the traditional media, and, I would say, is about to take control.We can find everything we want on the Internet – the latest news, books, songs, movies, cartoons… . With the radio, we can merely hear. Compared to a newspaper, the radio and TV can provide the latest information. For instance the breaking news of the Americans’ attacking Iraq was immediately online, as well as that the Twin Towers of New York were destroyed on September 11, 2001. However, we just cannot .The Internet is a way of getting information, as long as your mobile phone is connected or you possess a laptop. When I am a vehicle, I usually have my cellphone connected to the Internet, then browse through what in the past few hours, or log in MSN to begin a conversation with my friends. Reading a newspaper is also a good way to kill time, but for me, a youngster, it is not so modern as “surfing online while commuting”.The traditional media will never disappear, though the Internet has taken a big advantage the competition. And definitely, there is still a long way for the Internet to go. , the Internet benefits me the most, and I highly appreciate it.;The advent of technology has revolutionized the way we access news, with numerous platforms available at our fingertips. Among these, the radio, TV, and the Internet are the most prominent sources of up-to-date news. Each medium has its unique advantages, but in my opinion, the Internet stands out as the best source of news.Firstly, the Internet offers unparalleled convenience and accessibility. With just a few clicks, one can access a vast array of news websites, blogs, and social media platforms that provide real-time updates on current events. This convenience is particularly significant in today's fast-paced world, where staying informed is crucial. Unlike radio and TV, which have fixed schedules and limited coverage, the Internet allows users to browse news at their leisure, 24/7.Moreover, the Internet provides a diverse range of news sources, enabling users to cross-check information and form a well-rounded perspective. Online news portals often feature in-depth analysis, opinion pieces, and multimedia content, which enrich the reader's understanding of complex issues. In contrast, radio and TV news are often restricted to brief, surface-level reports, lacking the depth and nuance that online news can offer.Another significant advantage of online news is its interactivity. Readers can engage with news articles through comments, forums, and social media, fostering a sense of community and encouraging public discourse. This interactivity is largely absent in traditional radio and TV news, which are typically one-way communication channels.In conclusion, while radio and TV remain important sources of news, the Internet's convenience, diversity, and interactivity make it the most effective medium for staying up-to-date with current events. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that online news will become even more sophisticated, further solidifying its position as the premier source of news.
1377;should children grow up in the city or countryside (advantages/disadvantages)?;Some people think it is better for children to grown up in the city, while others think that life in the countryside is more suitable for them. What are the advantages and disadvantages of both places?Living in the rural area is the best option for children by a group of people, while others believe that cities offer more opportunities. In my opinion, if the city offers security and green areas, I agree it is a better place to raise the next generation some advantages both sides.Firstly, the countryside in touch with nature, taking care of animals and helping with the gardening. Because of that, they learn how to protect the environment and to live without any technological equipment. Besides that, they have more freedom to play outside the house without any security worries, whereas in the city they are kept at home smartphones and computers for this reason. On the other hand, schools usually have lower quality and it is hard to find extracurricular classes. Therefore, children difficulties trying to develop their abilities besides the school curriculum.However, schools at metropolitan areas tend to have better quality and offer all kinds of activities. Even if there is a sport or an art course that the institution does not offer, it is possible to look for it in another place around the city. As a result, all children’s talents and passions can be easier to develop. On the other hand, security, pollution and contact with nature are issues that we have to worry about. The better option would be a city with an excellent quality of life where children could play in parks and gardens.To sum up, growing up in the countryside can be very positive for someone’s childhood, but the city will usually offer better opportunities for their talents’ development.This is a well written essay. It talks about all parts of the task and the arguments and ideas are extended and supported by some examples. The information is sequenced in a logical way and most of the ideas are linked using appropriate connective words. The choice of vocabulary is suitable to express the meaning of the writer, though in some instances word choice can be improved further (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows suggested corrections). Most sentences are error-free and demonstrate various levels of complexity. Overall this essay seems good enough to deserve IELTS Band 8.;The debate about whether children should grow up in the city or countryside has been a longstanding one. Both environments have their unique advantages and disadvantages that can significantly impact a child's development and well-being.On the one hand, growing up in the city has its benefits. Cities offer a wide range of educational and cultural opportunities, such as museums, libraries, and theaters. Children living in urban areas are also exposed to diverse cultures, foods, and lifestyles, which can broaden their perspectives and foster tolerance. Additionally, cities typically have better access to healthcare facilities, schools, and other essential services.On the other hand, growing up in the countryside has its own set of advantages. The countryside provides a peaceful and serene environment, away from the noise and pollution of the city. Children living in rural areas have more space to play and explore, and are often closer to nature, which can promote a healthier lifestyle. Moreover, the countryside often has a stronger sense of community, where neighbors know and support each other, providing a safer and more secure environment for children to grow up in.However, there are also disadvantages to consider. Cities can be overcrowded, noisy, and polluted, which can negatively impact a child's physical and mental health. Furthermore, the fast-paced and competitive nature of city life can be stressful for children. In contrast, the countryside can be isolated, with limited access to services and opportunities, which can hinder a child's educational and social development.In conclusion, whether children should grow up in the city or countryside depends on individual circumstances and priorities. While both environments have their advantages and disadvantages, a balance between the two can provide children with the best possible start in life. Ultimately, what matters most is providing children with a loving, supportive, and stimulating environment, regardless of whether it is in the city or countryside.
1379;should unpaid community work be mandatory in high school (agree/disagree)?;"Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programs (for example working for a charity, improving the neighborhood or teaching sports to younger children). To what extent do you agree or disagree?It is argued that voluntary services charity, cleaning the neighborhood, imparting knowledge to the underprivileged, should be made mandatory in the high school curriculum. I strongly agree as it not only helps in students becoming socially responsible adults but also in shaping their character.Firstly, community service inculcates a sense of responsibility towards the society, something that is needed to shape a good society. For instance, the introduction of Swatch Bharath scheme in my school, The Hyderabad Public School, ten years ago taught me not only to keep the surroundings of the school clean but also to never litter wherever I go. Hence, now I feel responsible to maintain cleanliness everywhere. Such services are needed to develop a better society in the future.Secondly, voluntary services cater to the overall character development of an individual. It a feeling of empathy in children which is needed to build a better character. For example, an alumnus of Montessori High School, who indulged in petty law-breaking activities during school confessed that it was the charity service that he did in high school; which in his mind; him in becoming a better person for his family and refrained him from committing socially irresponsible acts. Thus, such voluntary activities teach us to value what we have and in turn to our personality development.That being said, we cannot deny the fact that many students misuse the time allocated for these services by considering it as an excursion to enjoy with friends rather than a learning .In conclusion, although compulsory voluntary community service has its drawbacks, it is still useful in shaping a child as a socially responsible citizen and also in their overall personality development. Therefore, pupils should be encouraged to involve themselves in such activities.This is a well written essay. It addresses all parts of the task and the arguments and ideas are developed and supported. The information is presented in a logical order and the ideas are linked by appropriate connective words. The use of vocabulary conveys the exact meaning of the writer and there are only minor instances of a word being used somewhat unnaturally. Sentence formation demonstrates a high level of control and very few errors (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows suggested corrections). Overall this essay seems good enough for IELTS Band 8 level.";I strongly agree that unpaid community work should be mandatory in high school. Incorporating community service into a high school curriculum can have a profoundly positive impact on students. Not only does it foster a sense of social responsibility, but it also provides students with valuable life skills and experiences that cannot be replicated in a traditional classroom setting.Through mandatory community work, students are given the opportunity to engage with their community, understand the needs of others, and develop empathy. This experience can broaden their perspective, helping them become more compassionate and active members of society. Moreover, community work exposes students to various career paths and fields they may not have considered before, such as social work, healthcare, and environmental conservation.Additionally, unpaid community work helps students develop important skills such as teamwork, communication, and problem-solving. By working together towards a common goal, students learn to rely on each other's strengths and support each other's weaknesses, mirroring real-world professional environments. These skills are not only beneficial for their future careers but also in their personal lives, making them more adaptable and resilient.Critics may argue that mandatory community work could be an additional burden on students who are already overwhelmed with academic responsibilities. However, the benefits far outweigh the costs. Even a modest requirement, such as 20 hours per semester, can make a significant difference. It allows students to balance their academic and community commitments, ensuring that they derive the maximum benefit from both.In conclusion, making unpaid community work mandatory in high school is a forward-thinking approach to education. It prepares students for an active role in their communities, equips them with valuable skills, and fosters a sense of responsibility and compassion. By integrating community service into high school education, we are not only shaping better students but also better citizens for the future.
917;‘Failure is proof that the desire wasn’t strong enough’To what extent do you agree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Failure is what nobody wish for, but it could occur secondarily to an unsuccessful attempt towards ones goal, for various reasons. I am in the view that, failure is not a proof of lack of desire, rather it is more to do with improper techniques, less allocation of time and lack of proper attitude.It is the general view that, ultimate success in any field is taught through the failures in life. One can be subjected to multiple failures due to lack of ability to develop essential skill set, also known as techniques, that would be essential to achieve a certain goal. One classic example is Thomas Alwa Eddison, the great inventor of all time, who went through nearly 100 unsucessfull experiments, before inventing the light bulb. He was brave enough to accept the failure experiments had taught him 100 different impossible ways not to discover the light bulb.On the other hand, time plays one of the most crucial factors in obtaining a goal/success. By this I meant, the time that is allocated towards full filling tasks that are directed towards preparing for the goal. The little time is spent during the preparation, the further away the goal felt like. For an instance, one cannot expected to win a marothon with just one day preparation.Similarly, attitude plays by far the most striking part of the success. This is simple as, one cannot dream of becoming a good physician, having shown no interest in paying attention to people and their health related complaints.In a nut shell, failure is not a proof for inadequate desire in fact, failure is due to improper practices of techniques,failure of managing time in preparing and attitudes that fires the drive.;"The statement ""Failure is proof that the desire wasn't strong enough"" suggests that the intensity of one's desire is the sole determinant of success. While I understand the sentiment behind this statement, I only partially agree with it. In my opinion, the relationship between desire and success is more complex.On one hand, it is true that a strong desire can drive individuals to work tirelessly towards their goals, which can ultimately lead to success. For instance, Thomas Edison's perseverance in inventing the light bulb is a testament to the power of strong desire. Despite facing numerous failures, his unwavering commitment to his goal eventually led to his success. In such cases, it can be argued that the desire was indeed strong enough to overcome obstacles.On the other hand, failure can occur due to various factors beyond the individual's control, such as lack of resources, inadequate guidance, or simply bad luck. For example, a student may have a strong desire to excel in a particular subject, but may still fail due to ineffective teaching methods or personal circumstances. In such cases, it would be unfair to conclude that the desire was not strong enough.Furthermore, failure can often be a valuable learning experience, and it does not necessarily mean that the desire was insufficient. Many successful individuals, such as J.K. Rowling and Stephen King, have spoken about how their initial failures fueled their subsequent successes. Their experiences demonstrate that failure can be a stepping stone to success, rather than a reflection of weak desire.In conclusion, while a strong desire is undoubtedly important for success, I do not believe that failure is solely a proof of weak desire. Other factors, including circumstance, guidance, and luck, play a significant role in determining success. Therefore, it is essential to approach failure with a nuanced perspective, recognizing both its potential to indicate weak desire and its value as a learning experience."
1419;“Some people say that the education system is the only critical factor to development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?”;Education plays a vital role in the development of a country. Therefore, some people think that the education system is the only important factor to the development of a country and they may be right.Education is the foundation of developed society. It is rightly said, ‘education is a ladder success’. If all the people of any country are educated then they becomes broadminded, civilized and progressive. An educated society improves the standard of life as well., education also creates a good employment opportunity and therefore country does not have to suffer from big problems like unemployment. Educated peoples are more aware of such as pollution and many more. A country becomes technologically advanced because of educated people.Not only this, but also by giving importance to education, the nations can get rid of problems like , poverty, unemployment and population growth that delay the progress of a nation. The crime rate can also be kept under . The standard of living of the people will go up. If the nations to be progressive it is very important that the people are more educated and progressive. Any country can become more technologically advanced and developed because of education.However, there are other factors that also play an important role in the development of a country. Such as governments have to encouraged people to do soIn conclusion, I would like to say that a good education system will lead to a developed country.;The notion that the education system is the sole critical factor in the development of a country is a debatable topic. While I acknowledge the significance of education in fostering growth and progress, I disagree that it is the only crucial element.On one hand, education plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of a nation. It equips individuals with necessary skills, knowledge, and critical thinking abilities, which are essential for driving innovation, economic growth, and social advancement. An educated populace is more likely to contribute to the development of a country by actively participating in the workforce, engaging in civic activities, and adopting healthy lifestyles. Furthermore, education has a multiplier effect, as it empowers people to make informed decisions, challenge existing norms, and strive for better living standards.On the other hand, there are numerous other factors that contribute to a country's development, such as infrastructure, healthcare, governance, and economic policies. A well-developed infrastructure, for instance, facilitates the movement of goods, services, and people, thereby boosting trade and commerce. Similarly, a robust healthcare system ensures a healthy workforce, which is vital for productivity and economic growth. Effective governance and prudent economic policies also create a conducive environment for investment, innovation, and entrepreneurship, all of which are critical drivers of development.In conclusion, while the education system is undoubtedly a vital component of a country's development, it is not the only critical factor. Other essential elements, such as infrastructure, healthcare, and governance, also play significant roles in shaping the trajectory of a nation's growth. Therefore, a holistic approach that incorporates multiple facets is necessary to achieve comprehensive development and propel a country towards prosperity.
