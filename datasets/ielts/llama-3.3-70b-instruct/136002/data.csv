1395;Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone’s life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is a negative one. Discuss both views and include your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. You should write at least 250 words.;Many people wonder about . Some people think that it has negative impact in our life. However, positive effect on this world.? Of Course for several reasons: firstly, it motivates the psychological point in everyone, and women in particular. They will run to buy this advertised product especially if it’s from , just to show their beauty to men, which may lead to negative effects of too much sexual attention. Secondly, you can sit comfortably with your family and suddenly the telephone is ringing, but it’s nothing important, it’s just another company to convince you to buy one of their products. It is a real . Lastly, sometimes you do not have the financial ability to buy something, but with these new methods of advertisement, you run to buy it, which affect your budget.On the other hand, there are some good sides to advertising. For instance, it compares the prices of many companies which the consumer. Besides, it really see more products which we unless the TV or Radio advertised them. , it breaks our daily routine and allows us to see new faces and learn the language better with the help of the daily updates they deliver through .In conclusion, as we can see there are many aspects to this . I feel that we gain no benefits at all from advertisement, it plays buy more things that they do not need it at all.;The advent of modern technology and media has sparked a heated debate about its impact on our lives. While some people think that it has a negative impact, I firmly believe that it has a positive effect on our world. There are several reasons that support this notion.Firstly, media and technology motivate individuals, particularly women, from a psychological standpoint. It empowers them to pursue their goals and ambitions, and provides a platform for self-expression. However, it is worth noting that excessive sexual attention in the media can have negative consequences. Nevertheless, the benefits of motivation and empowerment far outweigh the drawbacks.Secondly, technology has made it possible for us to access a vast amount of information and connect with others from the comfort of our own homes. For instance, we can sit comfortably with our families and receive important updates or messages through our phones. Although, at times, we may receive unwanted calls or messages from companies trying to convince us to buy their products, the benefits of staying connected and informed are undeniable.Lastly, while it is true that sometimes we may not have the financial ability to purchase certain products or services, technology has also made it possible for us to access affordable alternatives and make informed purchasing decisions. Overall, the positive effects of technology and media on our lives, including motivation, empowerment, and access to information, far outweigh the negative impacts. By harnessing the power of technology and media, we can create a more informed, connected, and empowered society.
845;Boxing is a blood sport which often results in physical injury. It is inappropriate for this sport to exist in the modern age.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;There is debatable issue as to whether boxing, a seemingly bloody sport, should be excluded from the modern society. As far as I am concerned, the attempt to remove boxing from the current age is utterly unjustified.Admittedly, boxing is often associated with various disturbing factors, such as foul language, disregard to rivals, violent punches and inelegant appearance as a result of intense physical contacts. However, such gory scenes may frequently take place in underground boxing games which are barely recognised by the professional community of boxing and by the legal system. Unlike underground boxing, professional boxing upholds moral principles and universal values, for examples, respect to opponents, obedience of rules, etc. Also, professional boxers are protected by safety equipment and judges who may stop the game when witnessing any player suffering serious injuries. Therefore, the health hazards involved in boxing games may not be as severe as the public assumes.Another reason reinforcing my position is that boxing already enjoys considerable popularity around the world and plays an important part in people's entertainment, as exemplified by the successful ticket sales of most boxing games and high audience rating of TV programmes broadcasting boxing matches. Given such popularity of boxing, the removal of this sport may cause widespread dissatisfaction and complaint.To draw a conclusion, the exclusion of boxing is completely groundless and irrational, given the safety protection, sportmanship and popularity as reflected in this sport. I expect in the future, more views could arise to furnish the understanding in this regard.;The sport of boxing is often misunderstood and associated with disturbing factors such as foul language, disregard for rivals, and violent punches. Additionally, the intense physical contact involved in the sport can lead to an inelegant appearance, further perpetuating the negative stereotype. However, it is essential to note that such gory scenes are more likely to occur in underground boxing games, which are barely recognized by the professional community of boxing.In contrast, professional boxing upholds moral principles and universal values that are often overlooked by the general public. One of the core values of professional boxing is respect for opponents, both in and out of the ring. Boxers are expected to show humility and sportsmanship, win or lose, and to conduct themselves in a manner that reflects positively on the sport. Furthermore, professional boxing has a strict set of rules that boxers must obey, and any disregard for these rules can result in severe penalties.The professionalism and integrity that define the sport of boxing are a far cry from the disturbing scenes often associated with it. The sport demands discipline, hard work, and dedication from its athletes, and in return, it provides a platform for them to showcase their skills, strength, and resilience. By upholding moral principles and universal values, professional boxing promotes a positive and respectful image, one that is often overshadowed by the negative perception of the sport. In conclusion, professional boxing is a sport that values respect, obedience to rules, and moral principles, and it is essential to distinguish it from the underground and unregulated forms of the sport that may perpetuate negative stereotypes.
1429;Boys are most influenced by their fathers and girls are most influenced by their mothers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons to support your opinion.;It is true that nowadays have a great influence children. Some people hold the opinion that the same sex is the major determination of influencing parent, but others . As far as I am concerned, . My arguments for this point are listed below.First of all, a father is the person who have already passed ways his son is passing now, in other words, sons are following their father’s footsteps. , based on experience it is easy for a father to notice his sons’ drawbacks and to influence them.Secondly, it is true that a boy is , a girl is a subtle and fragile one. It is hard for mothers to influence their sons, because it is not likely that can affect a strong one.In conclusion, it seems to me unfair that boys are most influenced by their mothers. Based on at least two points above I strongly agree that children are influenced by a parent of the same gender.;The debate about the primary factor influencing parental roles has sparked a longstanding discussion. Some people hold the opinion that the same sex is the major determination of influencing parents, suggesting that same-sex parents are better equipped to raise children of the same sex. However, others argue that the quality of parenting is not solely determined by the parent's sex, but rather by their ability to provide a loving, stable, and supportive environment.As far as I am concerned, I firmly believe that the sex of the parent is not the primary factor in determining their influence on their child. My arguments for this point are listed below. Firstly, a parent's ability to provide emotional support, guidance, and role-modeling is not limited to their sex. Both mothers and fathers, regardless of their sex, can provide a nurturing environment that fosters their child's physical, emotional, and psychological development.Secondly, research has shown that children raised by same-sex parents exhibit similar social, emotional, and cognitive development as those raised by opposite-sex parents. This suggests that the sex of the parent does not have a significant impact on the child's overall well-being and development. Furthermore, what matters most is the quality of the relationship between the parent and child, rather than the parent's sex.Lastly, in today's society, the traditional nuclear family structure is no longer the only norm. Many children are raised by single parents, step-parents, or same-sex parents, and they can still grow up to be well-adjusted and successful individuals. In conclusion, while some people may believe that the same sex is the major determination of influencing parents, I firmly believe that it is the quality of parenting, rather than the parent's sex, that plays a more significant role in shaping a child's development and well-being.
1384;Children should be engaged in paid work, agree or disagree?;"In many countries children are engaged in different kinds of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?The issue of whether or not children should be engaged in some paid work has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that having some employment experience is conducive to a child’s learning and development, I contend that it would bring harm to the child’s and learning.First of all, a workplace designed for adults normally child-friendly facilities. Desks and chairs are too high for a child; the light switches are installed on the walls unreachable children; also emergency training and facilities such as phones are only provided to adults. Furthermore, various hazards such as polluted air and chemical fumes are still produced in factories and farms. Undoubtedly young people would suffer in such workplaces.Also, children would find it frustrating when they are not properly inducted before starting a job. A child working in a cement factory would feel a setback when he could not get immediate support while struggling with the procedures of recording different raw materials that required by the job. Further, without sufficient support, a child’s misunderstanding or inappropriately communicating with adults would only disappoint him and prevents him from active learning and interacting with other people.To conclude, a child’s paid employment experience would lead to a negative impact on their health and active learning. However, recognizing the importance of children’s learning and their awareness of responsibility, it is advisable to encourage them to be involved in some volunteering opportunities where they can meaningfully learn and interact with other people with sufficient care and support in place for such jobs.This is a good essay. There are only a few errors (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections), but otherwise this work seems worthy of Band 7.5 or 8. Remember to always proofread your essay before submitting it. Keep up the good work!";The engagement of children in paid work is a contentious issue that sparks intense debate worldwide. While some people vehemently oppose the idea, others see it as a vital opportunity for youngsters to gain valuable work experience. In my opinion, children's participation in paid work can be beneficial, but it must be approached with caution and careful consideration.On the one hand, paid work can provide children with essential life skills, such as time management, responsibility, and financial literacy. It can also foster a strong work ethic, independence, and self-reliance, which are crucial for their future success. Moreover, earning a salary can give children a sense of pride and accomplishment, boosting their self-esteem and confidence.On the other hand, it is crucial to ensure that children's work does not compromise their education, health, or well-being. Exploitation and abuse of child labor are serious concerns that must be addressed. Children's work should be limited to appropriate hours, tasks, and environments, and should not interfere with their schooling or recreational activities.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about children engaging in paid work, I believe that it can be a valuable experience when properly regulated and supervised. It is essential to strike a balance between protecting children's rights and providing them with opportunities to develop important life skills. By doing so, we can empower children to become responsible, capable, and confident individuals, equipped to succeed in their future endeavors. Ultimately, it is our responsibility to ensure that children's work experiences are positive, safe, and beneficial, rather than exploitative or harmful.
1383;Children these days are suffering from obesity, why and how can it be solved?;Modern children are suffering from the diseases that were once considered to be meant for adults only. Obesity is a major disease prevalent among children. What are its causes and what solutions can be offered?Nowadays, the increasing rate of overweight children and adults is a worldwide health issue. Obesity is a major problem which is increasing day by day in children. There are various reasons behind it. This essay will discuss the causes of obesity and offer some solutions.The first cause of obesity is junk food. It is often seen that mostly children are fond of burgers, pizzas, noodles and . These types of foods are easily available to them in school canteens. Children love to purchase chips, , ice-cream for lunch. Moreover, in this modern era, parents are working and they do not have time to cook at home. Parents often buy dinner for their children instead of preparing food at home. This calorie-rich diet is making children obese. This problem can be solved by teaching children to cook healthy foods for themselves and banning junk foods and fizzy drinks in schools. This diet can be replaced by milk, juice and fruits for lunch.The second cause of obesity is . It is true that the use of computers and television is increasing children. They spend most of their time watching television or playing video games on a computer. This technological advancement has reduced the level of physical activity in this specific age group. This issue can be resolved by encouraging children to do physical exercises. Parents can take their children to park to encourage playing with friends. Furthermore, schools can add sports in their curriculum to maintain physical fitness in their students.To sum up, it is clear that main causes of obesity are unhealthy eating and not enough physical activities. This ailment can be prevented and treated by healthy eating and physical exercises.This is a good essay.

Overall, this work seems worthy of IELTS Band 8. Keep up the good work!;The world is witnessing a disturbing trend where modern children are increasingly suffering from diseases that were once considered to be the exclusive domain of adults. One such disease that has become a major concern among children is obesity. Obesity, which was once thought to be an adult-only disease, has now become a prevalent health issue among children. The causes of childhood obesity are multifaceted and can be attributed to a combination of factors.One of the primary causes of childhood obesity is the sedentary lifestyle that many children lead today. With the advent of technology, such as video games, television, and computers, children are spending more time indoors and less time engaging in physical activities. Additionally, the increasing availability of high-calorie, high-fat, and high-sugar foods has also contributed to the rising rates of childhood obesity. Poor eating habits, such as consuming excessive amounts of junk food and sugary drinks, have become commonplace among children.To combat childhood obesity, several solutions can be offered. Firstly, parents and caregivers must encourage children to engage in regular physical activities, such as sports, dancing, or simply playing outdoors. Secondly, a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains must be promoted. Limiting the intake of junk food and sugary drinks is also essential. Furthermore, schools can play a vital role in promoting healthy lifestyles among children by incorporating physical education and nutrition classes into their curriculum. Finally, communities can also contribute by creating safe and accessible spaces for children to play and engage in physical activities. By adopting these measures, we can hope to reverse the alarming trend of childhood obesity and ensure a healthier future for our children. It is imperative that we take immediate action to address this issue and promote healthy habits among children.
425;Computers are now the basis of the modern world. They should therefore be introduced into classrooms, and their programs used for direct teaching purposes. However, dependence on computers in teaching may carry a certain degree of risk to students.Discuss both sides and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Computers are presntly an integral part of the civilized world and are essential to daily living. Some individuals believe that they should be introduced into the classroom and used for teaching purposes while others are of the opinion that dependence on computers in teaching may pose a risk to students.Introducing computers and their programs in educational instuitions for learning purposes is a beneficial thing to students. The world is fast changing and students need to meet up and be at par with others in the world. The globe is becoming a more digital place and computers are the core of that, teaching using computers will open students' minds to new possibilitiies, faster approaches and more advanced ways of solving problems. A recent study showed that 75% of students who were taught using computers are currently more successful than others in their work places.It is understandable that people also think that dependence on computers in teaching may be detrimental to students. The students may become lazy and may not necessarily want to use their brains to calculate or understand things because the computer has already done that for them. Also using computers to learn in the school environment is also just adding to screen time for the learners; they are already being exposed to lots of wrong things at home adding school to it may not neceesarily the best option.Personally, students have a lot to learn using computers but truthfully speaking most of them already have the technological know how when it comes to using computers and if they actually want to learn more about how to use them, they can do so at home using the popular learning sites, it doesnt necessarily have to be introduced into the school learning system.In conclusion,computers are currently the foundation of the modern world and have their advantages and disadvantages, if they are put to the right use at the appropriate place and time, its benefits are beyond measure.";The integration of computers and their programs into educational institutions has been a significant advancement in the learning process. This innovation has proven to be highly beneficial to students, as it enhances their understanding and retention of complex concepts. A recent study has revealed compelling evidence to support this claim, indicating that 75% of students who were taught using computers are currently outperforming their peers in the workplace. This substantial margin suggests that computer-aided learning has a direct and positive impact on students' future success.One of the primary advantages of introducing computers in education is that it caters to the existing technological proficiency of most students. In today's digital age, many students are already familiar with computers and have a solid foundation in technological know-how. By leveraging this existing knowledge, educational institutions can build upon students' existing skills, further enriching their learning experience. Computers provide an interactive and engaging platform for students to explore various subjects,Furthermore, computers offer a wide range of educational programs and resources that can be tailored to meet the diverse needs of students. These programs can provide personalized learning experiences, simulate real-world scenarios, and offer instant feedback, thereby facilitating a deeper understanding of complex concepts. As a result, students are better equipped to apply theoretical knowledge in practical situations, In conclusion, the incorporation of computers and their programs into educational institutions is a highly beneficial initiative. With the majority of students already possessing a strong foundation in technology, the integration of computers in learning can only serve to enhance their educational experience and ultimately, their future success. As evidenced by the recent study, the benefits of computer-aided learning are undeniable, and it is essential that educational institutions continue to invest in this innovative approach to learning.
1329;Crime rates are likely to decline due to the advancements in technology, which will help prevent and solve crimes in an easier way. Do you agree or disagree?;"Nowadays technology is advancing faster than ever and many fields are benefitting from the opportunities this trend presents. Some think that crime prevention can be one possible application of new technologies, by allowing to deter offenders or solve crimes in a faster and easier way. In my opinion, innovation in crime prevention can be a game-changer that will reduce both the number of crimes committed and the time it takes to catch those responsible for them.Not everyone is optimistic about the prospects of the use of new technologies in crime prevention, and those who subscribe to the more pessimistic view say that advanced technologies can be accessed by criminals, therefore raising the crime rates. Such tools can, indeed, cause more damage if they fall in the wrong hands; however, it would require the offenders to be highly skilled to be able to use the modern technologies. Statistically, many of them tend to have a lower level of education, and for that reason they are likely to stick to the old ways of committing crimes, whereas the minority of highly skilled criminals are unlikely to make a big difference to the crime levels.Law enforcement workforce, on the other hand, has a much better grip on modern technology. Nowadays police officers and detectives undergo special training, take regular skill update courses, and use high-tech equipment. Facial recognition and thermal imaging are just two examples of the important tools that police are already using to find and catch offenders faster. Ordinary citizens can do their part in preventing burglaries by installing sophisticated systems with sensors, CCTV video feed and various alarms to detect and deter thieves. The combined effort will, no doubt, push the crime curve down.To sum up, even though the wonders of technology are available to everyone, it seems to me that they will better assist law enforcement in solving crimes, and law-abiding citizens in protecting themselves and their property, rather than felons. This will tip the balance in favour of reduction in crime rate and make the world a safer place.";The rapid advancement of technology is transforming numerous fields and presenting unprecedented opportunities for growth and improvement. One of the potential applications of these emerging technologies is in the realm of crime prevention. Proponents of this idea argue that innovative technologies can be leveraged to deter offenders and solve crimes more efficiently.The integration of technologies such as artificial intelligence, surveillance systems, and data analytics can significantly enhance the capabilities of law enforcement agencies. For instance, advanced surveillance systems equipped with facial recognition software can identify and track potential offenders, enabling authorities to respond promptly and prevent crimes from occurring. Furthermore, sophisticated data analytics tools can help investigators analyze evidence and connect the dots between seemingly unrelated crimes, thereby facilitating faster and more accurate resolutions.Moreover, technologies like predictive policing can forecast high-crime areas and times, allowing law enforcement to concentrate their resources and personnel in areas of greatest need. This proactive approach can lead to a reduction in crime rates and a safer community. Additionally, the use of forensic technologies such as DNA analysis and digital forensics can aid in solving crimes that may have otherwise gone unsolved, providing closure for victims and their families.While some may raise concerns about the potential risks and unintended consequences of relying on technology in crime prevention, the benefits of these innovations cannot be overstated. By embracing these emerging technologies, law enforcement agencies can stay one step ahead of criminals, keep communities safer, and ultimately create a more just and secure society. As technology continues to advance at an unprecedented pace, the possibilities for its application in crime prevention are vast and promising, and it is essential that we explore and harness these opportunities to build a safer and more secure world.
1417;Dieting can change a person’s life for the better or ruins one’s health completely. What is your opinion?;Almost of the women today want a beautiful figure. That is why we are able to find a diet programme almost everywhere in the country. Most of the women have and gone on a diet before either to or just health problem.A proper diet programme will help you not only to slim down but also to have a eating habits. For instance more vegetables and fruits meat, fried food and carbonated drinks. For a diet programme we shouldn’t food and water.

This way of dieting will help you to avoid some of the health problems in the future like or a heart attack.However some people do not only go on a diet but they avoid eating and hungry for the whole day. All they have is just either water or juices. Also there people who buy special diet programmes over the counter which are not approved by the health department and they are doing so without consulting a doctor first. They do not follow the basic rules of dieting and this will lead them to some serious health problems like of some body parts or, even worse, death.In my opinion there is wrong with going on a diet as long as we follow the correct way of eating and .;In today's society, it is evident that almost every woman aspires to have a beautiful figure. This desire has led to a proliferation of diet programs across the country, with numerous options available to suit individual needs and preferences. A well-structured diet program is not only beneficial for slimming down, but also plays a crucial role in cultivating healthy eating habits.By following a proper diet program, individuals can develop a more balanced and nutritious approach to eating. For instance, a good diet program encourages the consumption of more vegetables and fruits, which are rich in essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. These foods not only provide the body with necessary nutrients but also help to keep it functioning optimally. On the other hand, a proper diet program often advises against excessive intake of meat, fried food, and carbonated drinks, which are high in unhealthy fats, sugars, and calories.The benefits of a proper diet program extend beyond weight loss to overall health and wellbeing. By adopting healthy eating habits, individuals can reduce their risk of developing chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer. Furthermore, a balanced diet can also improve energy levels, enhance mental clarity, and boost mood. In conclusion, a proper diet program is an essential tool for achieving a beautiful figure, as well as maintaining overall health and wellbeing. As the demand for diet programs continues to grow, it is essential to prioritize the development of well-structured and balanced programs that promote healthy eating habits and lifestyles.

1409;Dieting can change a person’s life for the better or ruins one’s health completely. What’s your opinion?;Dieting seems to be of our life in this modern society, especially for those who are health conscious. Different people choose different type of dieting methods, trying to achieve what they believe to be good for either their health or physical appearance. In general, most of the people who diet are focusing on controlling their weight.In our urban society, most of the working class not have the opportunity to consume . Their daily meals consist of fast food which contains large amounts of fat and salt. The most significant of this unhealthy lifestyle is the weight gain especially among those middle age working professionals.Therefore, most of these young and energetic people have to control their diet in order to stay in shape either for their appearance or health. The most common and proper method of maintaining one’s weight is eating less oily food, preferably more green vegetables, fruits and alcohol.However, some have resorted to losing weight by taking their diet to the extreme, not eating at all for days. Others will make themselves vomit after each meal. Many others will go for dieting medication and beverages that help them to lose their appetite. These unhealthy will cause internal damage in the long run.In my opinion, dieting for better health is more important than solely for looking attractive. Individuals who wish to control their weight should seek professional if they are unable to reduce their weight after switching over to a healthy diet for a period of time. Losing weight and losing your health at the same time does not benefit any individual.This essay needs some work. The first body paragraph explains the reason people have for dieting, whereas it should explain what are the advantages or the dangers of it. The second body paragraph explains how to diet, whereas it should present arguments for or against dieting. Therefore, the task is only partially covered here.;In today's urban society, the working class often finds itself constrained by the demands of time and affordability when it comes to dietary choices. As a result, many individuals resort to consuming fast food as their primary source of nutrition. Fast food, however, is notoriously high in fat and salt, making it a detrimental choice for long-term health. The consequences of such dietary habits are far-reaching, contributing to a myriad of health issues including obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.In my opinion, the emphasis on dieting should shift from merely achieving an aesthetically pleasing physique to prioritizing better health outcomes. While looking attractive can boost one's confidence and self-esteem, it is the health benefits of a balanced diet that should take precedence. A well-planned diet rich in nutrients, fiber, and lean proteins not only aids in weight management but also enhances bodily functions, improves mental clarity, and strengthens the immune system.Moreover, adopting healthy eating habits can have a positive impact on one's quality of life, enabling individuals to be more productive, energetic, and focused. It is imperative for urban societies to recognize the importance of accessible, affordable, and nutritious food options for all socioeconomic groups. Initiatives such as community gardens, nutrition education programs, and subsidies for healthy food alternatives can play a pivotal role in mitigating the reliance on fast food and fostering a culture that values health over mere physical appearance.Ultimately, the perception of dieting needs to evolve from being solely about physical attractiveness to encompassing the broader spectrum of health and wellbeing. By doing so, we can work towards creating a society where individuals prioritize their health, leading to a more vibrant, productive, and healthy community. It is time for us to redefine the purpose of dieting and make conscious choices that benefit our bodies, minds, and overall quality of life.
1323;Discipline is a growing problem in modern schools. Some people think that parents should discipline their own children, while others think it should be the responsibility of the government. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;While some people argue that parents should take sole responsibility for disciplining their children, others take the view that the government should be in charge of such matters. In my opinion, the young generation should be primarily guided by their parents where rules of behavior and moral principles are concerned. However, in some instances government intervention is necessary.On one side of the argument, there are people who hold the opinion that the responsibility of disciplining a child falls squarely on parents’ shoulders, since they are their first educators, and it is their duty to equip their children with good manners and morals even before their first day at school. In addition, every family has a unique understanding of what a suitable form of discipline entails. Therefore, some parents are concerned that any form of punishment meted out at school might be too harsh. To overcome this issue, they believe that parents should be informed by the school of their child’s wrongdoing so that they could decide an appropriate consequence for their behavior at home.Unfortunately, not all parents are objective enough to make the right decisions when it comes to the upbringing of their children. Some may lack information or sound moral background to discipline their children in a meaningful way. Therefore, the state should shoulder some of the responsibility by implementing a strict set of guidelines and policies on how to discipline children at school. I believe that such policies result in children who flourish and are more likely to become productive citizens that actively contribute to a prosperous nation. Also, this would help both parents and teachers understand which punishments are suitable for minor infractions like missing an assignment or major incidents like bullying or skipping school.In conclusion, while both views are commonly held in society, I believe that the government must be actively involved in the policies related to discipline at schools as this would ensure the well-being and successful development of the youth.;The debate surrounding who should be responsible for disciplining children has sparked intense discussion in recent years. Some argue that parents should be solely in charge of instilling discipline in their offspring, while others believe that the government should take the reins. In my opinion, the primary responsibility for guiding children and teaching them rules of behavior and moral principles should lie with their parents.Parents are best equipped to provide their children with the values, morals, and ethics that are essential for becoming responsible and respectful members of society. They have a unique understanding of their child's strengths, weaknesses, and individual needs, allowing them to tailor their approach to discipline and guidance. Moreover, parents are in a position to provide consistent and ongoing support, which is critical in shaping a child's behavior and character.However, there are instances where government intervention is necessary. In cases of child abuse or neglect, for example, the government has a responsibility to step in and ensure the child's safety and well-being. Similarly, in situations where parents are unable or unwilling to provide adequate guidance, the government may need to provide additional support or resources to help the child develop essential life skills.Ultimately, while parents should be primarily responsible for disciplining and guiding their children, there is a role for government intervention in exceptional circumstances. By working together, parents and governments can ensure that children receive the guidance and support they need to grow into capable, respectful, and responsible individuals. By striking a balance between parental responsibility and government support, we can help shape a brighter future for the young generation.
1066;Eating sweet foods produces acid in the mouth, which can cause tooth decay. (High acid levels are measured by low pH values)Describe the information below and discuss the implications for dental health.;The given graph shows the level of acidity in the mouth from consuming food that contains fruit or cane sugar and honey.To start with, if we take a look at honey-consistent food, we will notice that the acid level increases within the first 5 minutes. After that, the level of acidity remains at the rate of less than 5 pH, and, then goes down to a normal level. So, it is unlikely tooth decay to occur within such a short period of time.Regarding fruit and cane sugar-consistent food, it is quite noticeable that the acidity level increases dramatically at a level of less than 5.5 pH and 4.5 pH, respectively. However, the main difference between fruit and cane sugar is that the acid level of fruit sugar decreases within a bit more than 15 minutes. In contrast to it, the acid level of cane sugar goes down to a normal level within more than 25 minutes, which is more likely to get tooth decay.;The consumption of food and beverages containing fruit or cane sugar and honey has been shown to have a significant impact on the level of acidity in the mouth. A graph illustrating this relationship reveals a striking correlation between the pH levels of these substances and the resulting acidity in the mouth.Notably, the graph indicates that the acidity level increases dramatically when the pH level drops below 5.5 for fruit and 4.5 for cane sugar and honey. This sharp spike in acidity is a cause for concern, as it can lead to a range of oral health problems, including tooth decay and erosion. The rapid increase in acidity at these pH levels suggests that even small amounts of these substances can have a profound effect on the mouth's acidity.The difference in pH thresholds between fruit and cane sugar and honey is also noteworthy. The fact that cane sugar and honey have a lower pH threshold for acidity increase, at  than fruit, implies that these substances may be more potentially damaging to oral health. This is particularly significant, as many foods and beverages contain high amounts of cane sugar and honey, making them a common feature of many diets.Overall, the graph provides compelling evidence of the need for moderation in the consumption of foods and beverages containing fruit or cane sugar and honey. By being mindful of the pH levels of these substances and taking steps to mitigate their effects, such as practicing good oral hygiene and limiting consumption, individuals can help to protect their oral health and prevent the negative consequences of high acidity in the mouth.
1421;Even though Globalization affects the world’s economics in a very positive way, its negative sides should not be forgotten. Discuss.;Everything has sides in the world, and so has the of globalization . The effects of globalization on the world economy are .We must acknowledge that the negative effects are from a different kind than the positive ones. the negative sides, like low in less developed countries are important to .If we take the Eurozone for example, the economic changes the process are huge. Many companies have transferred their factories into cheaper production to in the world . The results are rising unemployment rates in the “old industrial countries”.In regard to the other countries on the world market, such as China, this job transfer is a big opportunity. But no one can that the consequences for the less developed countries where economy flourished, based on availability of cheap employees are highly important: globalization based on this facts brings problems.Nevertheless, there are also . In general it is remarkable that there is a new tendency in “Thinking Global”. For instance, people are willing to more languages and get educated about cultures. Countries as undeveloped, such as India, are getting chances to be the in a certain field.All in all it can be said that the effects of globalization are enormous. The of economic processes has changed completely. It is important to think in bigger terms, not just about the country. The positive things that this globalization process have brought us for the negative sides. The should be a world in balance, but this has yet to come.;The concept of globalization has become an integral part of our modern world, where everything has multiple sides and perspectives. Globalization, in particular, has far-reaching effects on the world economy, with both positive and negative consequences. It is essential to recognize that the negative effects of globalization are distinct from the positive ones, and it is crucial to acknowledge the importance of the negative sides, especially in less developed countries.On the one hand, globalization has brought numerous benefits to the world economy, including increased trade, economic growth, and job creation. It has enabled countries to specialize in their comparative advantages, leading to more efficient production and distribution of goods and services. Moreover, globalization has facilitated the transfer of technology, knowledge, and ideas, contributing to innovation and development.On the other hand, the negative effects of globalization cannot be ignored. In less developed countries, globalization has led to low wages, poor working conditions, and exploitation of workers. The influx of foreign investment and competition has also led to the decline of local industries, causing unemployment and economic instability. Furthermore, globalization has exacerbated income inequality, as the benefits of economic growth have largely accrued to the wealthy elite, leaving the poor and vulnerable populations behind.It is vital to acknowledge the significance of the negative sides of globalization, particularly in less developed countries, where the consequences are more pronounced. The low wages, lack of job security, and limited access to social services have severe implications for the well-being and livelihoods of people in these countries. Therefore, it is essential to implement policies and strategies that mitigate the negative effects of globalization and ensure that the benefits of economic growth are shared equitably among all nations and populations. By recognizing the complexities of globalization, we can work towards creating a more equitable and sustainable global economy.
1319;Even though experts believe that walking is a great way to improve one’s health, very few people walk nowadays. Why aren’t people walking? What can be done to encourage them to walk more?;The benefits of walking are numerous, and experts recommend it as a good way to keep healthy and fit. Despite this, the number of people who walk on a daily basis is on the decline. The reasons for this are manifold, but there are also several solutions that may help people walk more.Lack of time is the most common reason people cite for not engaging in any form of physical activity. These days most people have hectic schedules that involve juggling their work and home responsibilities. As a result, they are often too exhausted or pressed for time and therefore opt for faster and more comfortable forms of transport, such as cars, bikes or public transport. Another major reason for the reduced number of pedestrians on the roads is a lack of safety. Most full-time workers are not free to walk during the day, and will skip it in the evenings or early morning hours, if they do not feel safe enough to do so.Fortunately, there are quite a few solutions to this issue. One is making walkers safe, which means the government should ensure that there are enough sidewalks and streetlights available in every suburb, so that pedestrians can walk or jog safely whenever time allows. Another useful option is to create special walking tracks and parks in neighbourhoods where people can get some much-needed exercise in the evenings. The added benefit of promoting the healthy lifestyle and walking in the community makes this solution even more attractive.To conclude, the pressures of daily life and lack of safely while walking reduce the popularity of this healthy practice. Governments can reverse this trend by creating more green spaces for people to walk in and addressing their safety concerns.;The modern lifestyle has led to a significant decline in physical activity among individuals. When asked, the most common reason people cite for not engaging in any form of physical activity is the lack of time. With increasingly busy schedules, many people feel that they cannot spare the time to exercise or engage in physical activities. This has led to a sedentary lifestyle, which has numerous negative consequences on one's health and wellbeing.Another major reason that contributes to the reduced number of pedestrians on the roads is the lack of safety. Many cities lack proper infrastructure, such as sidewalks and crosswalks, making it difficult and dangerous for people to walk. Additionally, the presence of heavy traffic and crime in some areas can also deter people from walking. As a result, many people opt for other modes of transportation, such as driving or taking public transport, which further reduces the opportunity for physical activity.However, governments can play a crucial role in reversing this trend. By creating more green spaces, such as parks and gardens, governments can provide people with safe and accessible areas to walk and engage in physical activity. These green spaces can serve as a haven for individuals to escape the hustle and bustle of city life and prioritize their health and wellbeing. Moreover, the creation of green spaces can also help to reduce traffic congestion and promote a sense of community among residents. By investing in green infrastructure, governments can encourage people to lead a more active lifestyle, which can have numerous benefits for both physical and mental health. Ultimately, it is essential for governments to take proactive steps to promote physical activity and create a healthier and more sustainable environment for their citizens.
1410;Even though globalization affects the world’s economy in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. Discuss.;Everything has two sides and the globalization is not exception. Our first thoughts about this topic include the process of global “McDonaldisation” and, generally speaking, spreading across the whole Globe.Firstly, I would try to concentrate on the positive aspects of globalisation. As far as economy is concerned, like the Global Bank or IMF are always focused on developing the ‘Third World’ and helping poor people to combat their life obstacles (through loans and donations). Moreover, the world becomes an area of sharing thoughts (e.g. philosophical or economical doctrines), which become popular due to lack of barriers.However, disadvantages of globalization are also widely known. Some people insist that because of this process, the spirit of countries and nations rapidly disappears. The integrity, established years ago is on the verge of collapsing. Furthermore, there’s a strong lobby of communists who , that the globalization indicates an uncontrolled reign of capitalists and slave work of lower labour-class. We should never forget about the detrimental impact of global investments on the environment – the green house effect or soar rains are triggered by globalization.To sum up, globalization has both positive and negative influence on our everyday life. I can’t agree with the popular statement that we should try to avoid being affected by it. However, we must not forget about our surroundings and local communities. They have a great value which should last forever.;Globalization, the increasing interconnectedness of the world's economies and societies, has become a ubiquitous aspect of our everyday lives. While some argue that we should try to avoid being affected by globalization, I firmly believe that this is an unrealistic and misguided stance. In reality, globalization has both positive and negative influences on our daily lives, and it is essential to acknowledge and navigate these effects rather than trying to avoid them.On the positive side, globalization has opened up new opportunities for cultural exchange, economic growth, and access to a vast array of goods and services. It has enabled people from different parts of the world to connect, share ideas, and collaborate on a scale that was previously unimaginable. For instance, the internet and social media have made it possible for people to communicate and access information from anywhere in the world, fostering global understanding and cooperation. Additionally, globalization has created new job opportunities, improved living standards, and increased economic competitiveness, contributing to the overall prosperity of societies.However, globalization also has its downsides, such as the risk of cultural homogenization, job displacement, and environmental degradation. The influx of multinational corporations can lead to the erosion of local cultures and traditions, while the relocation of industries can result in job losses and economic instability. Furthermore, the increased demand for resources and energy can contribute to environmental problems, such as climate change and pollution.Rather than trying to avoid the effects of globalization, we should strive to understand and manage them effectively. By acknowledging the benefits and drawbacks of globalization, we can work towards creating a more equitable, sustainable, and interconnected world. This can involve implementing policies that protect local industries and cultures, promoting fair trade practices, and investing in education and training programs that prepare workers for the challenges and opportunities of a globalized economy. Ultimately, embracing globalization and navigating its complexities is essential for building a brighter, more prosperous future for all.
1306;Every household should have a government-imposed limit on the amount of rubbish it can throw away. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"The amount of waste people produce can be quite shocking, with every person generating kilograms of rubbish in a single day, and all this can be difficult to manage. This has given some people the idea that there should be a limitation on the amount of rubbish produced per household; however, opinions are divided as to whether this would be the the most effective option.Having a limitation on the amount of waste produced sounds like a fine solution to a significant problem, with over two hundred and fifty million tons being generated in 2016 by the U.S. alone. Taxing households that break limits would push people to produce less waste and make them more mindful of what can be recycled or composted. However, forcing people to produce less waste might not be attainable.Households produce as much waste as they need to live their lifestyles. The waste people generate is only a result of the products they purchase, and will most likely wish to continue to purchase. Taxing people may be a cause of resentment, with many of them already struggling to pay their usual bills. In addition, if people produce more than they are allowed, this will encourage littering and dumping, so that they are not caught with more waste than entitled, and this in turn will damage the environment.Though controlling the amount of waste produced is important, there could be other ways of encouraging lesser output. In my opinion, governments should encourage composting and recycling, which will also reduce wasted material. People should also be more aware of what waste they produce and how it can be reduced. An education drive on these issues would perhaps be more likely to succeed in reducing rubbish than imposing limitations.";The Amount of Waste People Produce: A Growing ConcernThe amount of waste people produce can be quite shocking, with every person generating kilograms of rubbish in a single day. This staggering figure highlights the pressing issue of waste management, which has become a significant environmental concern. The sheer volume of waste produced daily has led to a growing debate about the need for effective measures to mitigate this problem. One proposed solution is to impose a limitation on the amount of waste produced per household.Proponents of this approach argue that setting a limit on household waste production would encourage individuals to adopt more sustainable practices, such as reducing, recycling, and reusing. This, in turn, would lead to a significant reduction in the overall amount of waste generated. Additionally, this limitation would also promote a sense of responsibility among household members, as they would be required to be more mindful of their consumption habits and waste disposal practices.However, opinions are divided as to whether this would be the most effective option. Some argue that imposing strict limitations on waste production could lead to unintended consequences, such as increased costs for households and businesses. Others suggest that education and awareness campaigns, rather than restrictive measures, would be more effective in promoting sustainable waste management practices. Moreover, the implementation of such a limitation would require significant resources and infrastructure, which could be a challenge for many communities.In conclusion, while the idea of limiting waste production per household has its merits, it is crucial to consider the potential implications and effectiveness of such a measure. A more holistic approach, combining education, awareness, and infrastructure development, may be necessary to tackle the complex issue of waste management. Ultimately, finding a solution to this growing problem will require a collaborative effort from individuals, communities, and governments to reduce the staggering amount of waste people produce daily.
1406;Every year an increasing number of students choose to go to another country for their higher education. Do you think the benefits of this development outweigh the problems associated with it?;The past twenty years have seen a dramatic change the number of students who go abroad . In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of this trend.On the one hand, both students and their country can benefit from this trend. First, students can choose more suitable methods for themselves because there are more options. The and teaching methods are quite different . According to foreign experts, Secondly, people can improve their foreign language, they can contact with when they are in a foreign country, and they quickly master the foreign language. Thirdly, it helps to promote the mutual understanding between their mother land and their destination countries. These students exchange information with the locals. Students can get better understanding of the countries. People in their home country will get more vivid information about other countries . Similarly, the locals also can get more clear recognition about other countries.On the other hand, there are disadvantages too. Firstly, it costs people a lot of money to begin college in foreign countries. Many families have to take out all their savings to support their children abroad. Secondly, some students cannot stand the big difference the new environment, they quit their study and come back home.To conclude, given the fact that in foreign countries helps students with their studies and promotes the mutual understanding countries, even if there are some drawbacks, I think the benefits outweigh the problems.;The past twenty years have seen a dramatic change in the number of students who go abroad to pursue higher education. This trend has sparked intense debate among educators, policymakers, and students alike. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of this trend, with a particular focus on the financial implications.Firstly, it costs people a significant amount of money to begin college in foreign countries. The tuition fees, living expenses, and travel costs can be overwhelming, making it difficult for many students to afford. This financial burden can lead to significant debt and stress, which can negatively impact a student's academic performance and overall well-being. Moreover, the high cost of studying abroad can limit opportunities for students from low-income backgrounds, creating a barrier to social mobility and equality.On the other hand, studying abroad can provide students with invaluable experiences and skills that can enhance their career prospects and personal growth. Immersing themselves in a new culture, language, and academic environment can broaden their perspectives, foster independence, and develop their adaptability. Additionally, studying abroad can provide access to specialized courses, renowned faculty, and state-of-the-art facilities that may not be available in their home country. This can lead to a more comprehensive education and a competitive edge in the job market.However, despite these advantages, the financial drawbacks of studying abroad cannot be ignored. It is essential for students, families, and governments to weigh the costs and benefits carefully and explore alternative options, such as scholarships, financial aid, and online courses, to make studying abroad more accessible and affordable. By doing so, we can ensure that the benefits of studying abroad are available to a diverse range of students, regardless of their financial background.
1305;Everybody today should pay a small amount from their income in order to help people who are homeless and / or suffering great poverty. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Homelessness and poverty is a terrible but topical issue in both more economically advanced and less industrialised countries. To deal with this, many people feel that a small proportion of everyone’s income should be used to aid the homeless and poor. This could create more opportunities and change the lives of many disadvantaged people for the better.Though there are certain facilities such as shelters and soup kitchens to aid the poor and homeless, it is clear that this is not enough. In the U.S. alone, a very developed country in itself, nearly two million people are homeless. These facilities can lend a helpful hand; however, they do not help eradicate the problem. Those people who are homeless or poor can have trouble finding jobs, or, if they are lucky to gain employment, the pay may not be enough to support them and their families.If a small percentage of everyone’s income was used to help build more aid facilities and fund organisations to help the homeless and poor, the suffering of many people could be alleviated. However, this is not a perfect world, and taxes are high enough for many people. A similar argument could be that a portion of the taxes already paid to the government should then be set aside for this cause, but of course government funds are usually stretched to breaking point as it is, as governments have so many financial responsibilities already.Though the fundamental idea that people should pay a small percentage of their income to help the homeless and poor is admirable, it is unlikely that enough people would agree to it. People need all the money they earn after taxes anyway and, although governments already have too many calls on their available funds, in my view they should prioritise support payments for the homeless.";The issue of poverty and homelessness is a pressing concern that affects many individuals and communities worldwide. Many people believe that a small proportion of everyone's income should be allocated to support the homeless and poor. This notion is rooted in the idea that collective contributions can make a significant difference in the lives of disadvantaged people. By setting aside a minimal fraction of their income, individuals can help create more opportunities for those in need, thereby changing their lives for the better.The potential benefits of such an approach are multifaceted. For instance, a small proportion of income dedicated to aiding the homeless and poor could be used to establish programs that provide essential services such as food, shelter, and education. These programs can empower disadvantaged individuals to break the cycle of poverty and become self-sufficient members of society. Furthermore, the positive impact of such initiatives can have a ripple effect, fostering a sense of community and social responsibility among the general population.However, it is also important to acknowledge that this is not a perfect world, and the practicality of such a proposal must be considered. One of the primary concerns is that taxes are already high enough for many people, and the idea of allocating a portion of their income for this purpose might seem burdensome. Many individuals and families are struggling to make ends meet, and the notion of contributing further to support social causes, no matter how noble, can be daunting. As such, it is crucial to strike a balance between social responsibility and economic feasibility. In conclusion, while the idea of dedicating a small proportion of income to aid the homeless and poor is admirable and potentially beneficial, it is essential to consider the complexities and challenges of implementing such a system. A nuanced approach that balances the need for social support with the economic realities faced by individuals and families is necessary to ensure that efforts to alleviate poverty and homelessness are both effective and sustainable.
1407;Financial education should be a mandatory component of the school program. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;In many countries the discussion about financial education getting more serious due to financial problems of young generation. Some people that financial education should be considered a mandatory subject at school.The common problem for those young people is that they don’t know how to spend money in right way. As we can see many advertisements often carry out the message, “Only 10 dollars a week, no deposits” which is misleading think that living in debt is normal. Financial education is one of the solutions for . The basic idea of financial education as a core school subject is to teach those young ones to understand the concept of using money and to estimate a risk of borrowing money to buy something in the future.However, another factor we need . In my opinion, the role of financial education is getting more important and it should be a part of the school program but the parents are also important and have responsibility to how to manage the money. More than 70% of young people’s money is from their parents. In addition, it has to be considered that a student might become person, talking about money all the time in class or even in a public place. It can be harmful for some students and affect their normal social life.In conclusion, I that financial education will have a positive effect on all young ones and other such social commutations should be considered just as important as financial education.;The importance of financial education has become a pressing concern in many countries, as the younger generation struggles with financial problems. In my opinion, the role of financial education is becoming increasingly crucial, and it should be incorporated into school programs. Financial literacy is essential for individuals to manage their finances effectively, make informed decisions, and achieve long-term stability.The integration of financial education into school curricula would provide students with the necessary skills and knowledge to navigate the complex world of personal finance. It would equip them with the ability to create budgets, understand credit, and make smart investment decisions. By teaching financial literacy from a young age, we can empower the next generation to make responsible financial choices and avoid common pitfalls such as debt and bankruptcy.However, the responsibility of imparting financial education does not solely lie with schools. Parents also play a vital role in shaping their children's financial habits and attitudes towards money. They can provide valuable guidance, share their own experiences, and serve as role models for responsible financial behavior. Parents can start conversations about money management, encourage saving and budgeting, and help their children develop a healthy relationship with money.In conclusion, the significance of financial education cannot be overstated, particularly for the young generation. It is imperative that schools and parents collaborate to provide comprehensive financial education, ensuring that students are equipped with the necessary skills to thrive in an increasingly complex financial world. By working together, we can empower the next generation to make informed financial decisions, achieve financial stability, and secure a brighter financial future. Ultimately, incorporating financial education into school programs and encouraging parental involvement can have a profound impact on the financial well-being of young people, setting them up for long-term success and prosperity.
1404;Full time university students spend most of the time studying. They should be doing other activities too. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Full time study in university is a great experience in life but in parallel to that students other activities such as working for their pocket money, sports, participating in debates and . People differ in their opinion if students must in other things or stay concentrated on their studies only. The discussion will be presented below, followed by my opinion.Some people say that mere studying does not youth for a country. This way, students only earn theoretical knowledge not practical. For instance, students can be their studies but at the same time when they , they fail and cannot develop their confidence and work as brilliantly as they were in university. Hence, the best approach for them to be engaged here and there for practical experience.On the other hand, others believe that building a better career is the foremost thing in today’s world. So, they are targeted to their studies and gain as much knowledge as they can. Furthermore, if they are diverted from their studies, they will not be able to their .In my point of view, there must be blending of full time education and extra activities. It refreshes students’ minds and provides more energy . Moreover, by this way, they will learn how to with other people in the society.To summarize, it can be said that it is important to concentrate on but on the other hand there must be something to keep active and relaxed being involved in games, music, work and other extra activities.;Full-time study in university is undoubtedly a great experience in life, offering students a wealth of knowledge, socialization, and personal growth. However, many argue that students should not limit themselves to just studying, but rather engage in other activities to enhance their overall university experience. On one hand, some people believe that students should focus solely on their studies, as it is the primary reason they are at university. They argue that diverting attention to other activities can negatively impact academic performance and potentially lead to poor grades.On the other hand, others contend that engaging in other activities, such as working part-time for pocket money, participating in debates, and joining clubs or societies, can be incredibly beneficial for students. Not only do these activities provide students with essential life skills, such as time management, teamwork, and communication, but they also offer a much-needed break from the rigors of academic life. Working part-time, for instance, teaches students the value of money and helps them become more independent. Similarly, participating in debates and discussions helps students develop critical thinking, public speaking, and argumentation skills, all of which are invaluable in the real world.Moreover, engaging in extracurricular activities can also boost students' confidence, broaden their social circles, and provide them with a sense of accomplishment and fulfillment. It allows them to explore their interests, develop new passions, and create lifelong friendships. In conclusion, while some people may argue that students should focus solely on their studies, it is clear that engaging in other activities can have a profoundly positive impact on a student's university experience. By striking a balance between academic and extracurricular pursuits, students can truly make the most of their time at university and set themselves up for success in all aspects of life.
1293;Having a salaried job is better than being self-employed. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;If one wants to work for money, there are really only two options, working for someone else for a salary and being self-employed. Most people are involved with these two options and they both have advantages and disadvantages.Being self-employed means that the worker owns the business that is being done. This might be a small one-person business or a large company with hundreds of employees. The first advantage of this is the capacity to earn more money. If the business does very well, the income can be considerable and the owner of the company will receive the benefits. On the other hand, if business is not good, the owner’s income will be low. Self-employed people also have the benefit to some extent of choosing their working hours and holidays and they have the right to change anything within their business. With this autonomy, however, comes the pressure to succeed and the reliance on one’s employees, if there are any, to do their best to make the business thrive.Salaried workers do not experience the same stress as the self-employed owners of companies. They might have stress in their duties, but the pressure that comes with keeping one’s own business operating successfully in order to support oneself and one’s family is just not felt by an employee. The employee also has a certain knowledge of his or her income, as the salary is usually fixed every month. The self-employed owner’s income often depends on how successful the business is. The employee’s fixed income, however, does not give much scope for earning large amounts more. In addition, an employee does not have the freedoms of the owner or the autonomy, and for many people, having control over their lives is a significant factor to their well-being.It is certain that there are advantages and disadvantages for both being self-employed and salaried. I personally disagree that being salaried is better than being self-employed. I prefer the autonomy that being self-employed brings and, although there is more risk and pressure, this can lead to greater and more fulfilling rewards.;The pursuit of financial gain is a fundamental aspect of modern life, and individuals seeking to earn a living are essentially presented with two primary options: working for someone else in exchange for a salary, or being self-employed. Both paths have their unique advantages and disadvantages, and it is crucial to weigh these factors when deciding which route to take.On one hand, working for someone else offers a sense of security and stability. With a fixed salary, individuals can budget and plan their finances with ease, knowing exactly how much they will earn each month. However, this security comes at the cost of autonomy, as employees are often bound by the rules and regulations of their employer. Moreover, the potential for income growth may be limited, as salary increases are often tied to performance reviews and company budgets.On the other hand, being self-employed offers the freedom to work on one's own terms and pursue entrepreneurial ventures. If the business does exceptionally well, the income can be considerable, and the owner will reap the benefits of their hard work and dedication. This autonomy, however, comes with a significant amount of pressure to succeed. Self-employed individuals must navigate the challenges of managing a business, including financial risks, marketing, and competition, all while shouldering the responsibility of generating their own income. Despite these challenges, many individuals find the rewards of being their own boss to be well worth the effort, as it allows them to pursue their passions and create a sense of personal fulfillment. Ultimately, the choice between working for someone else and being self-employed depends on one's individual priorities, risk tolerance, and goals.
1339;High-rise vs. low-rise buildings, which solution is better for a growing population?;Some cities create new housing for their growing populations by constructing a smaller number of high-rise buildings. Other cities create more of low-rise buildings. Which solution is better, in your opinion?Sample EssayRising population in urban areas leaves governments with no choice but to build more houses to meet the demand. However, when it comes to construction, there is more than one way to build new homes. Some cities prefer to construct fewer residential towers, while others build a larger number of low-rises for their residents. In this essay both options will be discussed and a viable solution will be suggested.One advantage of tall buildings is that they can accommodate a large number of people while having a small footprint. This type of construction is popular in central city areas where land is scarce and expensive. For example, in New York City high-rise buildings have significantly reduced housing problems, by as much as 55% in the last few years. As a result of this strategy, rents tend to decrease which has a further positive impact on the economies of such cities. However, tall buildings offer little or no privacy, they force certain rules and regulations upon residents, and attract higher maintenance costs.Given a chance to voice their opinion, many individuals would prefer to live in low-rise buildings or even build their own houses. This option might be more attractive for big families and for older generation people who like to have their own personal space. Accessibility is also a concern for the elderly as taking the stairs when the lifts break down may not be an option for them. In addition, one or two-story houses are easier and cheaper to maintain compared to modern apartment towers. The downside of this type of dwellings is that they occupy much more land, and since land is cheaper on city fringes, new estates tend to be built away from city centres. This increases commute time to work for their residents and negatively affects their quality of life.In conclusion, high-rise and low-rise buildings have their unique advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, high rises are more suitable for younger residents and should be built in the areas where young population is prevalent, closer to the city centre and employment opportunities. Senior citizens should have a supply of lower dwellings available in quieter locations. Such flexible approach can be a good way to address the needs of growing city’s population.;The increasing population in cities poses a significant challenge for urban planners, who must balance the need for housing with concerns about density, traffic, and quality of life. Two common strategies for addressing this issue are constructing high-rise buildings and building low-rise structures. In my opinion, the better solution depends on the specific context of the city, but I lean towards low-rise buildings as a more sustainable and livable option.High-rise buildings offer the advantage of accommodating a large number of residents in a relatively small footprint, which can be particularly beneficial in cities where land is scarce. They also often provide residents with amenities like gyms, community spaces, and rooftop gardens. However, high-rise living can lead to a sense of isolation and disconnection from the community and natural environment. Furthermore, high-density areas can strain local infrastructure and services, potentially leading to increased traffic, noise pollution, and higher costs for maintenance and utilities.On the other hand, low-rise buildings, such as townhouses or small apartment complexes, promote a more integrated and intimate community environment. They allow for more green spaces, easier access to local amenities, and a generally more peaceful living environment. Low-rise developments can also be designed to blend more seamlessly into existing neighborhoods, preserving the character of the area. Additionally, spreading the population over a larger area can reduce the pressure on local services and infrastructure, potentially leading to more sustainable and cost-effective urban management.In conclusion, while high-rise buildings have their advantages, especially in extremely densely populated areas, I believe that low-rise buildings offer a better quality of life and more sustainable urban development strategy for most cities. They promote community interaction, preserve local character, and contribute to a more balanced and environmentally friendly urban landscape. Ultimately, the choice between high-rise and low-rise construction should be guided by the specific needs, resources, and vision of each city, aiming to create livable, sustainable, and thriving urban environments.
1365;IELTS Essay, topic: Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between the rich and poor, while others disagree (discuss);Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between rich and poor people, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.There is no doubt that modern technology is reshaping our planet and affecting every aspect of human lives. From a social perspective, many people argue that the gap between the upper class and lower classes is widening as a result of technological advancements. Others, however, believe the opposite.There are several reasons why one could think that the wealth inequality is, indeed, increasing. The most common reason is automation. Driven by technology, automation reduces the need for manual labour. As a result, less work opportunities are available for unskilled people. With each iteration of the cycle the competition increases and wages decrease. , technology has increased the minimum level of needs that should be satisfied. Nowadays, everybody should have a mobile phone and an internet connection, including the poor. This increases the monetary burden on them as they must borrow to cover these new needs.However, I firmly believe that the aforementioned opinion is ludicrous. The most obvious reason is that modern technology has facilitated the road to riches in an unprecedented manner. For instance, many of the internet billionaires are from lower and middle classes. Moreover, the major leaps in agricultural technologies magnified food production. As a result, food has become more affordable and available. Finally, leveraging technology has dramatically increased workers’ productivity. Consequently, compensations and salaries have increased.In conclusion, I strongly believe that technology could possibly narrow the difference between social classes. Increased food production, opportunities and productivity are just few examples of technology’s contribution to bridging the wealth gap.This essay adequately covers all parts of the task. The ideas expressed in this written response are relevant, well-developed, ordered in a logical way and supported. The paragraphing is suitable and cohesion is maintained throughout the essay. A good range of vocabulary and the writer’s fluency are evident. There are no spelling errors and very few mistakes in word choice and grammar, most sentences are error-free. The essay is likely to get Band 8 in IELTS.;The advent of modern technology has sparked a heated debate about its impact on the socio-economic divide between the rich and the poor. While some argue that technology is exacerbating the gap between these two groups, others disagree, citing its potential to bridge the divide.On the one hand, those who believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between rich and poor people argue that it has created new opportunities for the wealthy to accumulate more power and wealth. For instance, automation and artificial intelligence have replaced low-skilled jobs, leaving many poor individuals without employment opportunities. Furthermore, the cost of accessing and utilizing modern technology, such as computers and high-speed internet, can be prohibitively expensive for low-income households. This creates a vicious cycle where the poor are unable to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to compete in the modern job market, thereby perpetuating their disadvantaged position.On the other hand, others disagree, arguing that modern technology has the potential to reduce the gap between rich and poor people. They point out that technology has made it possible for people to access vast amounts of information and educational resources, which can help individuals acquire new skills and knowledge. Additionally, online platforms and digital tools have enabled entrepreneurs and small business owners to reach a wider audience and access new markets, thereby creating new economic opportunities. For example, e-commerce platforms have enabled small-scale farmers and artisans to sell their products globally, increasing their income and economic prospects.In my opinion, while modern technology does have the potential to exacerbate the gap between rich and poor people, its benefits can be harnessed to reduce the divide. Governments and organizations can implement policies and programs that ensure equal access to technology and digital literacy training, thereby empowering disadvantaged groups to take advantage of the opportunities created by modern technology. Ultimately, the impact of modern technology on the gap between rich and poor people depends on how it is utilized and distributed, and with careful planning and management, it can be a powerful tool for promoting greater socio-economic equality.
1388;In many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?;Nowadays, many children involved in different types of jobs to have some kind of financial assurance for themselves. However, whether this is good for their development and personality is a controversial issue. I personally believe that paid works is harmful for children for several reasons.It is said that children gain valuable experience in the work place. This may be true. However, I would argue that children are mainly employed in jobs that require manual work and are poorly paid. The recent statistics reveal the common tasks that children are assigned to are washing dishes, mopping floors or serving food in restaurants. Meanwhile, this kind of jobs actually provide children with necessary and useful skills to apply in their future .This brings me to the second point. Defenders of child labour that it is an effective method of learning. The point is children should be able to apply knowledge taught to them in a real life working environment. Although this is undoubtedly true, it also means that children may neglect the classroom study and even fail the class. The worst thing is yet to come. They may become so preoccupied with the benefits ahead of them such as small salary that they may leave school.Finally, supporters say that it helps them to build responsibility in the family. They will understand how it is difficult to earn money and therefore have compassion for their parents. This is true to a certain extent, but may have a totally adverse effect on children. As children can make money at an early age, they would feel that it is appropriate to spend it on luxury things.In conclusion, I think that parents should take measures to restrict their child from work, otherwise it would have negative consequences to their future.;The phenomenon of children engaging in various types of jobs to secure financial stability has become increasingly common. Many young individuals are taking on part-time or full-time work to support themselves and their families, often sacrificing their childhood and adolescent years. While this trend may provide financial assurance, it sparks a heated debate about its impact on their development and personality.On one hand, some argue that working at a young age can be beneficial for children's development. It teaches them valuable skills such as responsibility, time management, and independence, which are essential for their future careers. Moreover, working children can develop a strong work ethic and understand the value of money, leading to a more financially literate and responsible adult. However, this perspective overlooks the potential risks and drawbacks associated with child labor.On the other hand, many experts contend that involving children in the workforce can be detrimental to their development and personality. Children who work long hours may miss out on crucial educational opportunities, social interactions, and play, which are vital for their cognitive, emotional, and social growth. Furthermore, the pressure to work can lead to stress, anxiety, and exhaustion, ultimately affecting their mental and physical health. Additionally, working children may be exposed to hazardous environments, exploitation, and abuse, which can have long-lasting and devastating consequences.In conclusion, while working can provide financial assurance for children, its impact on their development and personality is a complex and contentious issue. It is essential to strike a balance between providing financial support and ensuring that children have the opportunity to enjoy their childhood, receive an education, and develop into well-rounded and healthy individuals. Ultimately, it is crucial to prioritize children's well-being, safety, and development over financial gain, and to create alternative solutions that support both their economic and personal growth.
1411;In many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it to be a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion on this?;In the Third World, children are usually sent to factories for laborious work. Many people believe that it is merely exploitation, while others think it is a good opportunity for them to life experience. In any case, children have their right to live and study in peaceful conditions. Therefore, using them as workforce is considered an unacceptable action.First of all, children are not workers. They have just learned about the vast world and do not have any experience or concept of working. Since these innocent children are naive and , they can be easily cheated and exploited. There are many examples of this in poor nations. Because using children is cheap and to control, many enterprises hire them and don’t pay them much. Although the government in these countries has tried its best, this kind of taking advantage of children cannot be eliminated.Moreover, children do not need such thing as ‘valuable work experience’ that is supposedly ‘important for learning and taking responsibility’. The brief responsibility of children is learning. They are not old enough to understand what working experiences are. Nevertheless, they can help parents do chores or housework. This will be a much better way for them to become more responsible for . In addition, childhood is one of the most remarkable memories and must not be taken away by forcing them to work.In conclusion, since all children are the great concern of parent and society, they should be allowed to enjoy life and rather than to work. Hence, one must ponder what view is actually appropriate for the sake of the children.;"The notion that children should engage in work to gain valuable experience is a misguided concept. Children are not workers; they are young individuals who have just begun to explore and learn about the vast world around them. At this stage in their lives, they lack the experience and understanding of what it means to work, and are therefore vulnerable to exploitation.The idea that children need to work to learn and take responsibility is a flawed one. Children are still developing physically, emotionally, and cognitively, and their primary focus should be on education and play, not labor. By introducing work into their lives, we are putting them at risk of being taken advantage of by unscrupulous individuals who seek to exploit their naivety and innocence.Children can be easily cheated and exploited due to their lack of understanding of the complexities of the working world. They may not recognize unfair labor practices or understand their rights as workers, making them prime targets for those who seek to take advantage of them. Moreover, engaging in work at a young age can have long-term negative consequences on their physical and mental health, as well as their future educational and career prospects.Rather than emphasizing the importance of work experience, we should be focusing on providing children with a nurturing and supportive environment that allows them to learn, grow, and develop at their own pace. This can be achieved through play, education, and extracurricular activities that promote socialization, skill-building, and character development. By prioritizing their well-being and protection, we can ensure that children are able to thrive and reach their full potential, without being exposed to the risks and hardships associated with work. Ultimately, children are not workers, and it is our responsibility to safeguard their childhood and provide them with the care and support they need to succeed."
361;In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?;"Money can not buy happiness! Is one of the most famous sayings while talking about finances. It is argued that topics around money, wealth, and poverty are becoming dramatically more frequent between humans in different countries around the world. In my opinion, the extream part of it is a negative development; although, it has some positivities. I will address some of both sides in this essay.Talking about money during the major part of the day might make the person look stingy and this is an attitude that majority of the community would not like, thus, might effect on the person's social life. Moreover, having the same topic in mind all day might lead to an obsession, and as a result, this could lead to a depression because the person might not find the proper way to reach to the financial position that meets their satisfaction, which could lead to depression, or even worse such as going through illegal paths where it could destroy their lives entirely!Nevertheless, the person should be aware of his /her income and spendings and try to enhance their financial position to the best possible way. Also, the inflation that we are currently living and the noticable increase in prices could be a driver for people to talk about money more often.In conclusion, people should not be obssessed in money and to talk with everyone about it all the time. However, I believe that people should discuss this matter in order to benefit from each other, and to find more ways to enhance their quality of life.";The topics of money, wealth, and poverty have become increasingly dominant in conversations among individuals from diverse countries worldwide. In my opinion, the extreme focus on these subjects is a negative development, although it does possess some positivity. On one hand, discussing financial matters can foster a sense of community and cooperation, as people share advice and experiences on managing resources and overcoming economic challenges.However, the excessive preoccupation with these topics can have detrimental effects on mental health. When the same themes of money, wealth, and poverty consume our thoughts every day, it can lead to an unhealthy obsession. This relentless focus can distort our perspective, making us prioritize material wealth over other essential aspects of life, such as relationships, personal growth, and well-being. As a result, this obsession can ultimately lead to depression, as individuals become overwhelmed by the pressures of financial stress and the anxiety of not meeting societal expectations of wealth.Furthermore, the constant discussion of financial matters can also create unrealistic expectations and promote a culture of competition, rather than cooperation. This can lead to a sense of inadequacy and low self-esteem among those who are struggling financially, exacerbating the problems of poverty and inequality. In conclusion, while discussing money, wealth, and poverty can have some benefits, the extreme focus on these topics is, in my opinion, a negative development that can have severe consequences on our mental health and overall well-being. It is essential to strike a balance and prioritize other aspects of life to maintain a healthy and positive outlook.
671;In many countries women and men are working full time. It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;I strongly agree with this statement. If women and men are both working full time, they should share household works.First of all, if women and men are working full time, and they are working in the same amount of time, logically, the amount of time they do household works should be the sam e. However, if one of them work for longer hours, the household works should still be shared but the other one should do more household works.Second of all, everyone have responsibility to do household works because everyone lives in the house, makes the house dirty, creates dirty clothes and dishes. If there is only either women or men doing household works, it is not fair at all, because they both work full time.But as I mentioned before, the amount of time doing household works can be arranged, it doesn't have to be evenly shared. For instance, if the woman in this family work for longer hours or got an extra call by work, the man should help and do her part of household works. And when the man are working more, the woman should do the same. This does not only solve the problem of who should do household works but can also show that women and men are supporting each other in various situations.In conclusion, when women and men are both doing full time jobs, they should share household works. But it doesn't have to to be split in two halves, it can have alternatives depending on the working hours or special situations. In this way, the house can be more peaceful and have more harmony without arguments about who should do the household works.;The concept of sharing household responsibilities has become a pressing issue in modern society, particularly when both men and women are working full-time. Traditionally, women were expected to take on the bulk of household chores, while men focused on providing for the family financially. However, this outdated notion no longer applies in today's egalitarian society. When both partners are contributing equally to the household income, it is only fair that they share the household responsibilities as well.Sharing household works is not about dividing the tasks evenly, but rather about finding a balance that works for both partners. The amount of time spent on household chores can be arranged in a way that suits the couple's lifestyle and schedule. For instance, one partner may take on more responsibility for cleaning, while the other handles cooking and laundry. The key is to communicate and come to a mutual understanding of what needs to be done and how it can be divided.By sharing household responsibilities, couples can create a more peaceful and harmonious home environment. When both partners feel that their contributions are valued and recognized, they are more likely to feel satisfied and content with their living situation. This, in turn, can lead to a stronger and more supportive relationship. Moreover, sharing household chores can also help to reduce stress and resentment that can build up when one partner feels that they are shouldering the bulk of the responsibility.In conclusion, when both women and men are working full-time, it is essential that they share household responsibilities to maintain a peaceful and harmonious home. By communicating and finding a balance that works for both partners, couples can create a more equitable and supportive living environment. This not only benefits the individual partners but also strengthens their relationship and contributes to a more harmonious household.
1343;In many countries young people start living on their own after high school, is this a positive or negative development?;In many countries around the world young people decide to leave their parents’ home once they finish school. They start living on their own or sharing a house with friends. Is this a positive or a negative development? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples.Sample EssayNowadays it is becoming increasingly common for youngsters to start their independent life by moving out of their parents’ home after graduation from school. This trend has positive effects on the society and the reasons behind it will be discussed next in this essay.There are various benefits for both young people and their parents when individuals start living independently after finishing school. Young adults, in this way, have to take care of their daily needs, from house chores, cooking or cleaning to financial independence. Thus, instead of wasting time on childish activities, they are motivated to learn skills and work part-time or full-time in order to cover their living expenses. Although it might seem challenging for them to live on their own at first, it would give them valuable experience, helping them to become mature, responsible adults. Parents would also be pleased with this practice since they can enjoy their own lives by having more time for themselves. Not only would they have more financial flexibility due to independence of their children, but they also don’t have to change their habits in order to adapt to the new generation’s lifestyle. For instance, it allows many people to travel around the world, which would be impossible if their children were to stay with them after finishing high school.Admittedly, there might be some challenges involved in this way of life. In some cases and especially under the influence of new friends or housemates, youngsters might choose to get involved in dangerous activities that involve drugs or petty crimes. However, instead of keeping their children close through adulthood, parents should prepare in advance and raise their children to distinguish between right and wrong and teach them to take responsibility for their actions.In conclusion, although there might be some adverse consequences to this relatively new practice, I believe that the advantages of young people leaving family home outweigh its drawbacks, for both children and parents.;The trend of young people leaving their parents' home after finishing school has become increasingly common in many countries around the world. In my opinion, this development is largely positive. One of the main advantages of this trend is that it allows young people to develop independence and self-reliance. By living on their own or sharing a house with friends, they are forced to take responsibility for their own lives, including managing their finances, cooking, and cleaning.For instance, in countries like the United States and Australia, it is common for young people to move out of their parents' home and start living in dormitories or shared apartments with friends while they attend college or university. This experience not only helps them develop important life skills but also fosters a sense of community and camaraderie among young people. Additionally, it provides them with the opportunity to make their own decisions and learn from their mistakes, which is an essential part of growing up.Moreover, living away from their parents' home allows young people to explore their own interests and pursue their passions without interference or pressure from their family. For example, many young artists and musicians have moved to cities like New York or Los Angeles to pursue their dreams, and have been able to develop their talents and build successful careers as a result. Overall, while there may be some challenges associated with young people leaving their parents' home, I believe that the benefits of independence, self-reliance, and personal growth make this trend a positive development.
1320;In many countries, a lot of food is wasted. Why do people waste food? How can we reduce the amount of food waste?;"Despite the fact that millions of people in the world go hungry every day, a surprisingly large amount of food gets wasted daily in certain parts of the world. In my opinion, the main reason for this is that people in the first-world countries tend to only buy food that is aesthetically pleasing, and fortunately, there are some ways to tackle this issue.It is shockingly sad to know that large amounts of perfectly edible food in the form of fresh produce get sent to landfills, and the main reason for this is that these foods do not meet the standards of perfection set for fruits and vegetables by consumers and grocery stores. For example, veggies and fruit that are misshapen or have a few spots on them are still good enough to eat, yet they are often left on shelves to rot in favour of something that looks less damaged. In addition, a lot of customers confuse the ‘best by’ and ‘use by’ dates, thinking that foods that have passed their ‘best by’ dates are no longer fit to eat. Another major reason for food wastage is that people often overestimate the amount of produce they require on a weekly or monthly basis, and most of it ends up getting thrown out instead of being used.There are many ways to reduce the amount of food being wasted, and I think one of the best ideas is to increase people’s awareness of just how much good food is disposed of, only because of our superficial biases as to how food should look. Raising the awareness of the staggering number of people that go hungry in third-world countries would make it harder to throw away an apple just because it is a little bruised. Also, teaching people how to better plan their monthly food requirements would help them not to overspend on food that they do not need; it would be great for the environment and their budget. The role of the government in this endeavour is indispensable as such task would be too great for any smaller organisation.To conclude, the wasting food is a serious issue that merits increased awareness from both people and the leaders of the world. It is unacceptable to discard any food when there are so many people who are starving, and hopefully our joint effort can help improve the current situation.";The paradox of food waste is a stark reality that plagues our world today. Despite the fact that millions of people go hungry every day, a surprisingly large amount of food gets wasted daily in certain parts of the world. This phenomenon is particularly prevalent in first-world countries, where the culture of consumerism and superficiality has led to a penchant for aesthetically pleasing food. In my opinion, the main reason for this wastage is that people in these countries tend to only buy food that looks perfect, often discarding items that are slightly bruised or irregularly shaped.This mindset has severe consequences, as it results in a substantial amount of edible food being thrown away. The environmental, economic, and social impacts of this waste are multifaceted and far-reaching. However, there are many ways to reduce the amount of good food being wasted. One of the most effective strategies, I believe, is to increase people's awareness of just how much good food is disposed of. By educating consumers about the scale of food waste and its consequences, we can inspire a shift in behavior and attitudes towards food.Raising awareness can be achieved through various means, such as social media campaigns, documentaries, and community outreach programs. By highlighting the issue and its solutions, we can encourage individuals to make conscious choices about their food purchases and consumption habits. Additionally, governments and businesses can play a crucial role in reducing food waste by implementing policies and practices that promote the sale and consumption of imperfect produce. Ultimately, by working together to address this issue, we can make a significant dent in the staggering amount of food waste that occurs daily, and work towards a more sustainable and equitable food system.
1331;In many countries, young people are finding it harder and harder to find permanent jobs. Why is this happening? What can be done to improve the situation?;In this fast-moving age, with the development of education and modern technologies, people strive to have a secure job after graduating from colleges and universities. Despite their efforts, so many young adults in different parts of the world have a negative experience of finding a long-term job.It so happens that most colleges and universities focus on students’ academic performance much more than their practical skills. Unfortunately, many companies reserve permanent job opportunities for experienced applicants because there is no need to invest much in their training. Lack of practical experience in new graduates puts them at a disadvantage as far as companies are concerned. The situation is made worse by the abundance of advanced technologies that can easily replace human labor. Robots and computers work more efficiently and with higher precision than humans. That shrinks the pool of available job placements even more, as companies only need to hire highly educated and experienced staff.Fortunately, there is a number of solutions that can help inexperienced workers gain permanent employment. An obvious one is that universities could offer internships to their students, or arrange workshops in addition to classwork. This would help students to get training and experience in their respective fields. Also, the government could examine the demands of changing labor market and steer young people towards professions that will be popular in the coming years. Together with colleges and universities the government could create special awareness programs for graduates, providing them with an overview of various job offers and their benefits. This way students would be able to choose the right jobs for themselves.To sum up, lack of demand in the labour market and insufficient experience are two major reasons why many young people have trouble finding a permanent position. Helping them gain hands-on experience as part of their studies and educating them about career options early on is key to improving the employment outcome for them.;The Transition to Employment: A Challenge for Young AdultsIn today's fast-paced and competitive job market, many young adults face significant challenges in finding long-term employment. This issue is a global concern, affecting new graduates in various parts of the world. One of the primary reasons for this struggle is the lack of practical experience among newly graduated individuals. Companies often view inexperienced candidates as less desirable, putting them at a disadvantage in the hiring process.The traditional education system, which focuses primarily on theoretical knowledge, is partly to blame for this issue. While academic credentials are essential, they do not necessarily equip students with the practical skills required in the workplace. As a result, new graduates often lack the hands-on experience and real-world skills that employers seek in potential employees. This gap between academic preparation and workplace expectations makes it difficult for young adults to secure long-term jobs, leading to frustration and disappointment.Furthermore, the lack of practical experience also limits the ability of young adults to compete with more experienced candidates in the job market. Employers often prioritize candidates who can make an immediate impact, over those who require training and development. This creates a vicious cycle, where new graduates are unable to gain experience because they are not given the opportunity, and are not given the opportunity because they lack experience.To address this issue, it is essential to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Educational institutions,ed to incorporate more practical training and internship opportunities into their curricula, providing students with the hands-on experience they need to succeed in the job market. Additionally, governments and companies can play a role by offering apprenticeships, mentorship programs, and entry-level positions that cater to new graduates. By working together, we can better equip young adults with the skills and experience required to secure long-term employment and thrive in their chosen careers.
1318;In many workplaces online communication has overtaken face to face meetings. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?;In today’s ever-increasingly digital world, online communication has become the norm for many workplaces. While this development offers numerous advantages for companies such as greater flexibility and efficiency, it also brings with it certain disadvantages like miscommunication, which must be weighed against its benefits.One of the primary advantages of online communication is that it makes it easier for teams to stay in touch without having to physically convene. This is especially beneficial when individuals or groups are dispersed across vast distances. Reduced travel costs, as well as time saved from not having to travel to and from meetings, also represent meaningful savings for businesses. Additionally, online communication platforms often have a range of features designed to make collaboration more efficient, such as providing an easy way to share documents and other materials with remote team members. To illustrate, digital resources can be sent quickly and securely via email or other software services like Dropbox or Google Drive.There is a potential drawback associated with relying too heavily on online communication at work, as the lack of physical proximity between members of a team can often lead to misunderstandings due to a loss of context or nonverbal cues that would otherwise be present during face-to-face meetings. However, in my opinion, issues of this nature can be solved by using written language more carefully to avoid any confusion or miscommunication among colleagues.In conclusion, when online communication tools are used properly, they undoubtedly provide companies with greater flexibility in how their teams collaborate without sacrificing clarity of communication, quality or efficiency.;In today's increasingly digital world, online communication has become the norm for many workplaces. This development has revolutionized the way companies operate, offering numerous advantages such as greater flexibility and efficiency. With the ability to communicate remotely, employees can work from anywhere, at any time, as long as they have a stable internet connection. This flexibility has led to increased productivity, as employees can manage their work-life balance more effectively. Additionally, online communication has enabled companies to expand their reach, connecting with clients and colleagues across the globe, and facilitating international collaborations.However, this shift towards online communication also brings with it certain disadvantages. One of the most significant drawbacks is the risk of miscommunication. Without nonverbal cues, such as body language and tone of voice, online communication can often be misinterpreted. This can lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and errors, ultimately affecting the overall performance of the company. Moreover, the lack of face-to-face interaction can also lead to a sense of isolation and disconnection among team members, which can negatively impact teamwork and morale.Furthermore, the overreliance on digital communication can also lead to a lack of depth and nuance in conversations. Important discussions and decisions may be reduced to brief, impersonal messages, lacking the richness and context of in-person interactions. To mitigate these disadvantages, companies must implement strategies to ensure effective online communication, such as regular video conferencing, clear guidelines for digital communication, and training on effective online collaboration. By acknowledging the potential pitfalls of online communication and taking steps to address them, companies can harness the benefits of digital communication while maintaining the essence of human connection and effective teamwork.
713;In many workplaces, online communication is getting more common than meeting face to face. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?;According to COVID-19 event forced many company to change their way of working. One of the most significant transformation is the communication. The online communication becomes a must or inevitable for the company to be implemented. In this topic, we're going to disscuss the advantages and disadvantages for both ways of communications. The online meeting can introduce a significant impact to the organization while face to face meeting can be outdated for this new era of 2021.First of all for the online communication's advantages is that in the pandemic period the actual physical contact is a significant way to transmit the disease. Video conference can help mitigate this problem by lower the physical contact for each conversation or meeting. Also communicates through online channel can help individual to organize or manage their time efficiently according to each person preference. For example, a single mom parent may be able to spend times for her sons/daughters at home, while be able to have a cross country meeting with another department in other region. Another reason is that some people are quite introvert and find it difficult for face to face human interactions or conversations, in which online chat or messages can help them to mitigate this problem and communicate efficiently. Lastly as mentioned about video conference across region, online meeting can help the multi-national corporates save the transporations cost and additional resources needed to spend for face to face meeting.For the disadvantages, all of the online communications required hardware, internet connection and technological knowledge on how to use them. This technological gap can be seen as one of the most significant obstracle or disadvantage for people to use online communications. For example, in one company, there obviously have a various age of people, in which some of them are not familiar with the technology. Since video call conference has been introduced and utilized widespread among corporates not so long time ago. This can be a big technological gap for some people to use the online communications and result in a lost in communications among the workplaces.As a result, online communication helps an organization to reduce the risk of transmitting the disease, improved the time mangement ability and productivity for each individuals, and lower the financial cost or resources required to spends for international business activities. With all these advantages of online communication stated, they can be seens as a significant reasons to outweight the disadvantages of technological gap on this current year of 2021.;The advent of online meetings has revolutionized the way organizations operate, introducing a significant impact on their functioning. In this new era of 2021, face-to-face meetings seem to be becoming outdated, and for good reason. One of the most notable advantages of online communication is its ability to mitigate the risks associated with physical contact, particularly during pandemic periods. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of minimizing physical interactions to prevent the transmission of diseases. Online meetings provide a safe and convenient alternative, allowing individuals to participate remotely and reduce the risk of infection.Moreover, online communication channels offer individuals the flexibility to organize their time efficiently, according to their personal preferences. With the absence of geographical constraints, individuals can participate in meetings from anywhere, at any time, as long as they have a stable internet connection. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for organizations with global teams or clients, as it enables them to collaborate and communicate effectively, regardless of their physical location. Additionally, online meetings save time and resources that would be spent on traveling, accommodating, and hosting physical meetings.In conclusion, online meetings have become an essential tool for organizations in the modern era. They offer a safe, flexible, and efficient means of communication, making them an attractive alternative to traditional face-to-face meetings. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that online meetings will become even more sophisticated, further solidifying their position as a cornerstone of organizational communication. By embracing online meetings, organizations can streamline their operations, enhance productivity, and thrive in a rapidly changing world. Ultimately, the shift towards online meetings is a necessary adaptation to the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century.
1265;In recent years, the family structure has changed, as well as family roles. What are the changes occurring? Do you think these changes are positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In our modern days, families had witnessed a considerable change regarding their structure and the roles of individuals inside it. These changes are mainly the patriarchal structure that was dominating families in the past compared to a more balanced arrangement nowadays. In addition to that, there are more freedom and rights for women in recent years. And I believe its an advantageous development.Fathers used to be the only leaders of the families of past decades, however in recent days mothers had shared the leadership and started taking part in family decisions just like their partners. Also during recent decades women obtained greater deal of their civil rights which allowed them to take different roles from those that were common for females in the past decades. As an example, women can now own the family house, sign important documents, drive cars which were a breakthrough for women to be able to participate in family plannings and decisions.It appears to be an advantage to have women being able to be effective members of their families, that is because they can share responsibility, add their feminine qualities to the lives of their families as well as for them to be able to fulfill their own life by feeling the importance of their existence and their roles.As in a recent research that found families with women in them are happier, more content, and definitely healthier.In conclusion, the family system nowadays differs vastly from before, owing to the more roles that women are taking, and to the more rights and freedom they gained, and in my perspective it is a positive change.;The modern family has undergone significant transformations in recent years, marked by a shift in its structure and the roles of individuals within it. Historically, families were characterized by a patriarchal structure, where men held dominant positions and women were relegated to subordinate roles. However, this traditional dynamic has given way to a more balanced arrangement, where power and responsibilities are shared more equally among family members.One of the most notable changes is the empowerment of women, who now enjoy greater freedom and rights than in the past. Women are no longer confined to domestic duties, but are free to pursue careers, education, and personal interests. This shift has not only contributed to a more balanced distribution of power within the family but has also led to a more equitable society. Women's increased participation in the workforce and their greater autonomy in decision-making have been instrumental in breaking down the patriarchal barriers that once defined family structures.The evolution of family structures has also been influenced by changing social norms and values. With the rise of feminism and gender equality movements, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of shared responsibilities and mutual respect within families. As a result, men are now more likely to take on domestic and childcare responsibilities, while women are more likely to pursue careers and financial independence. This shift towards a more balanced and egalitarian family structure has not only strengthened family bonds but has also contributed to a more harmonious and inclusive society.In conclusion, the modern family has witnessed a significant transformation in its structure and the roles of individuals within it. The decline of patriarchal structures and the rise of more balanced and egalitarian arrangements have been accompanied by greater freedom and rights for women. As society continues to evolve, it is likely that family structures will continue to adapt, reflecting the changing values and norms of our modern world.
1399;In some countries children have very strict rules of behavior, in other countries they are allowed to do almost anything they like. To what extent should children have to follow rules?;Freedom plays a pivotal role in everybody’s life. We can see in today’s modernized era that nobody likes to be restricted, whether it is a child or an adult. Some people think that there should some strict rules of behavior for children, but I disagree with this statement.that sometimes more restrictions can cause more frustration in children, which leads to many other mental problems as well. they can . Sometimes they feel under pressure, which can be the main reason for their poor performance in their field. In some cases children may insist on doing .In other words we have to look other aspects as well, if we usually ignore our children’s bad habits, then they good human beings in their future life. Moreover if we never draw attention the children’s main activities then they might end up in a bad company. They the value of respect for their elders importance of relationships. They their cultural values as well.In a nutshell, I would like to say that children should be the value of their customs, rituals and respect towards their elders for their future life, but most of the additional restriction should . It would good human beings in their future.;The notion that children should be subject to strict rules of behavior is a widely debated topic. While some individuals believe that a rigid set of guidelines is necessary for a child's development, I strongly disagree with this statement. In my opinion, imposing too many restrictions on children can have detrimental effects on their mental and emotional well-being.When children are forced to adhere to a strict set of rules, they can become frustrated and feel suffocated by the lack of freedom. This frustration can lead to a range of mental health problems, including anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. Children need to be able to express themselves and make their own decisions in order to develop important life skills such as problem-solving and critical thinking. Overly restrictive rules can stifle this development and prevent children from reaching their full potential.Moreover, strict rules can also lead to a lack of trust and communication between children and their caregivers. When children feel that they are not being given the autonomy to make their own choices, they may become rebellious and resistant to authority. This can lead to a breakdown in relationships and a lack of respect for boundaries. In contrast, a more flexible and nurturing approach to child-rearing can foster a sense of trust and openness, allowing children to feel comfortable approaching their caregivers with questions and concerns.In conclusion, while some may argue that strict rules are necessary for children's development, I firmly believe that this approach can do more harm than good. By giving children the freedom to make their own choices and learn from their mistakes, we can help them develop into confident, capable, and well-adjusted individuals. It is essential to strike a balance between guidance and autonomy, allowing children to thrive and reach their full potential.
681;In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development;Nowadays, many businesses have to compete each other in order to survive from the rapidly changing world, leading to the high amount of time that employees spend on working. There are also other reasons why the employees work for a long period which I will discuss in this essay. In terms of consequences, I personally believe that spending most of our time at work is the negative development.It is the fact that people have various rationales to work for long hours. A classic example is the dynamic working condition. There are many companies that provide services such as consultation to customers, meaning that if their service does not completely satisfy the clients’ need, such client may decide to use the service from other competitors. Hence, the employees are required to dedicate their time to deliver the best service to the clients. Another common criticism is a bright career path. When the employees work for a long period, they can carefully check their works and, as a result, delivery the works with less mistakes. Doing this way could impress their manager and they are likely to get promotion in return.With a careful consideration regarding the consequence of working for long hours, there are many vital drawbacks. An obvious effect is the increase in illness. People who work very hard have to spend a lot of their time at work. Therefore, they may not have enough time to do exercises, weakening the immune system of their body. Furthermore, with the rise in the amount of working hours, people tend to lack social skills. This is because they may not be able to manage time to join social events or meet their friends, resulting in the less ability to adapt to new environments.In conclusion, it is undeniable that people work for long hours because of the requirement in business and personal career goal which, in my opinion, leads to negative development for themselves. This is because this behavior negatively affects their health condition and social competency which are the two most important aspects in our life.;The trend of employees working for extended periods has become a prevalent phenomenon in today's fast-paced work environment. There are many reasons why employees work for a long period, and this essay will delve into the implications of this trend. One of the most obvious effects of prolonged working hours is the increase in illness among employees. When individuals spend a significant amount of time at work, they often neglect their physical and mental well-being, leading to a decline in their overall health.People who work very hard and put in long hours at the office or workplace have to spend a substantial amount of their time away from home and family. This can lead to an imbalance in their work-life balance, causing stress and anxiety. As a result, employees may experience a range of health problems, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and mental health disorders. Furthermore, the rise in working hours can also have a profound impact on an individual's social life. With limited time for leisure activities and socializing, people tend to lack social skills, leading to feelings of isolation and disconnection from friends and family.The lack of social skills can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only personal relationships but also professional ones. Effective communication and teamwork are essential in most workplaces, and employees who struggle with social interactions may find it challenging to collaborate with colleagues and build strong working relationships. In conclusion, the prolonged working hours of employees have significant consequences, including an increase in illness and a lack of social skills. It is essential for organizations to recognize these effects and implement strategies to promote a healthier work-life balance, ensuring the well-being and productivity of their employees.
101;In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .;Over decades, there has been a belief that adults should support adolescents to work in a company or travel to another country at least one year before going to university. Despite the fact that there are many positive aspects of having experiences in terms of working and travelling before studying at university, with a careful consideration, there are also negative points of this.It is true that working or travelling before starting a university program positively affects juveniles’ development. A classic example of this is an effective way to truly understand their academic preferences. When juveniles have work experiences, such as having a one-year internship in a company, they tend to learn a wide variety of work functions, helping them know the academic discipline they want to learn at university. Another benefit from taking a long journey to another place before studying at university is the opportunity to get exposed to new culture. This is because while adolescents are on an epic expedition to other parts of the world, they tend to meet new people with different nationality and belief, leading to valuable life experiences that they cannot receive from a professor at university.In spite of the aforementioned advantages of working or travelling before starting university courses, there are also drawbacks. A common example of this is graduating from a college late, compared to juveniles who immediately start a university program after they finish high school. This is exemplified by Thai culture which believes that young people who graduate from university later than their peer would not have a successful career path. In addition, opponents of this notion might argue that working before finishing university is not well worth doing. Since most works require a strong academic foundation in order for juveniles to deliver results with fewer mistakes, the juveniles should study at university instead.In conclusion, it is undeniable that having work experiences or taking a journey before starting a university life has many benefits for young people with respect to knowing the academic fields they want to study and learning new cultures outside a classroom. Nevertheless, doing this could also have drawbacks in terms of the delay in university graduation and an ineffective performance in working.;The notion that adults should encourage adolescents to gain real-world experience by working in a company or traveling to another country for at least a year before attending university has been a long-standing belief. Proponents of this approach argue that it provides young individuals with invaluable life skills, independence, and a broader perspective on their future academic and career pursuits. By taking a gap year, adolescents can mature, explore their interests, and develop a stronger sense of purpose, which can ultimately lead to a more focused and successful university experience.However, with careful consideration, there are also negative points to this approach. One of the most significant drawbacks is the potential delay in academic progress. A common example of this is graduating from college late, compared to juveniles who immediately start a university program after finishing high school. By taking a year off, students may fall behind their peers, which can impact their future career prospects and earning potential. Additionally, some individuals may struggle to readjust to academic life after a year-long break, which can lead to difficulties in completing their degree.Furthermore, taking a gap year can also lead to a loss of momentum and motivation. Without the structure and routine of academic life, some adolescents may find it challenging to stay focused and driven, which can result in a lack of direction and purpose. Moreover, the financial implications of taking a gap year should not be overlooked, as it can lead to increased expenses and a heavier student loan burden. In conclusion, while taking a gap year can be beneficial for some, it is crucial to weigh the pros and cons carefully and consider individual circumstances before making a decision.
1304;In some countries, boys and girls are educated separately after the age of about ten years old. Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;In many countries around the world, boys and girls are educated together. There is a group of countries, however, that educate boys and girls separately. This is frequently done on religious grounds, but not always. Having such a system can produce various advantages and disadvantages.One of the principal reasons for educating boys and girls separately is that, if they are together, they can distract each other. After puberty, boys can be strongly attracted to girls and vice versa, and this can result in disruptive conduct in the classroom as, for example, they show off to one another. Separating boys and girls can therefore have the distinct advantage of reducing this disturbing behaviour. However, some teachers have pointed out that this model does not always work, and that separated boys and girls are equally disruptive in class, and sometimes more so. These teachers say that having the opposite sex in the classroom can actually improve behaviour.Many educators also believe that boys and girls have different learning styles and needs. Separating boys and girls can allow teachers to address these needs more easily. There is also a belief that single sex schools allow gender stereotypes to be challenged and therefore education aspirations can be broadened.A major disadvantage of separating boys and girls in education is that the children miss important formative behavioural development when they do not have interaction with the other gender on a regular basis. This can lead to shyness and, more seriously, dysfunctional relationships later in life. Some people also feel that mixed sex schools can promote gender stereotypes rather than reducing them.In conclusion, I feel that children should be educated all together, although I would respect a system in which they are separated due to religious beliefs. My personal opinion is that different genders should learn to interact together from an early age, as this would allow them to develop healthy working relationships with each other.;The education system is a vital component of a country's development, and its structure can vary greatly from one nation to another. In many countries around the world, boys and girls are educated together in the same institutions, sharing classrooms and learning experiences. This co-educational approach is based on the principle of equality and the belief that both genders can learn from and benefit each other in a shared academic environment.However, there exists a group of countries that adopt a different approach, separating boys and girls into different schools or classes. This practice of single-sex education is often rooted in religious beliefs, where the separation of genders is seen as a way to maintain modesty and adhere to religious teachings. For instance, in some Islamic countries, boys and girls are educated separately as a means to uphold the principles of hijab and gender segregation.Yet, the reasons for separate education are not solely based on religious grounds. Some countries or educational institutions may choose to separate boys and girls due to cultural, social, or even pedagogical reasons. For example, some argue that single-sex schools can provide a more focused learning environment, free from the distractions that can come with co-education. Others believe that boys and girls have different learning styles and that separating them can allow for more tailored teaching methods.Regardless of the reasons, the debate over co-education versus single-sex education continues, with proponents on both sides presenting compelling arguments. While co-education promotes equality, socialization, and mutual understanding between genders, single-sex education can offer a more specialized and distraction-free learning environment. Ultimately, the choice between these two educational approaches depends on a country's cultural, religious, and educational priorities, highlighting the diversity and complexity of educational systems around the world.
785;In some countries, only few young people go to classical music concerts or or play classical music. Why? Should young people be encouraged to attend and learn more?;Classical music is one of the oldest artistic samples of our history. However, the young people of the new generations do not appreciate this kind of music. I believe that governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and I will support my stand with valid arguments in the following paragraphs.First of all, the main reason behind the little interest of young people in classical music is the impact of globalization in music and arts. That is because people have the opportunity to know more about multiple things without leaving their homes. However, all this knowledge is only superficial and arts, more specifically classical music, is diminished by the big international industry of music. For instance, reggaeton music, despite the fact that its lyrics are often misogynous, is the most popular style of music these days.Another reason is that children and young people have less interest in cultural matters than in the past because governments do not invest in culture and arts. In most countries, investment in culture has been drastically reduced and young people have no access to classical music concerts and much less a musical instrument that has a huge cost. Consequently, governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and the arts.To summarise, this essay has examined the idea of classical music and why young people do not have an interest in this kind of music. As far as I am concerned governments should take responsibility in this matter and invest more money in culture and classical music encouraging young people to learn more about this kind of art.;Classical music is one of the oldest and most revered artistic expressions of human history, with roots dating back to ancient civilizations. The works of legendary composers such as Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach continue to inspire and influence music lovers around the world. However, it is alarming to note that this timeless art form is slowly losing its appeal among the younger generations. Many young people today find classical music to be outdated and unrelatable, preferring instead the more contemporary and upbeat rhythms of modern music.I firmly believe that governments have a crucial role to play in promoting and preserving classical music, as well as the arts in general. By encouraging young people to learn more about classical music, governments can help to foster a deeper appreciation and understanding of this rich cultural heritage. This can be achieved through initiatives such as music education programs in schools, subsidies for concerts and festivals, and partnerships with music institutions to provide accessible and affordable lessons.Moreover, exposure to classical music has been shown to have numerous cognitive and emotional benefits, including improved concentration, memory, and emotional intelligence. By introducing young people to classical music, governments can not only help to preserve a vital part of our cultural legacy but also contribute to the intellectual and creative development of future generations. Ultimately, it is our collective responsibility to ensure that classical music continues to thrive and inspire, and I believe that government support and encouragement are essential to achieving this goal. By working together, we can safeguard the future of classical music and enrich the lives of young people everywhere.
1334;In the modern world, it is possible to shop, work and communicate with people via the Internet and live without any face-to-face contact with others. Is it a positive or negative development?;The feasibility of shopping, working and communicating through the Internet is gradually eliminating the necessity of in-person encounters. I believe the merits of this opportunity outnumber its demerits and the lowered volume of traffic in addition to the possibility of long-range communication will be discussed as reasons for this claim in this essay.One chief benefit of using the Internet as a means of making purchases, working and communicating would be the lowered demand for transport, through eradicating the need for face-to-face contact. Such decreased volume of transportation would result in fewer harmful gas emissions which could significantly contribute to creating a cleaner environment. Furthermore, reduced commuting burden yields more free time for individuals. It could be spent in various ways such as working, studying and socialising with family and friends to name a few, which would be more productive and enjoyable.Another key merit of using the Internet would be the emergence of state-of-the-art telecommunication applications. These technologies have made it possible for those with access to the Internet to get in touch and send and receive audiovisual content by pushing just a few buttons. This presents a stark contrast to the situation only a few decades ago, when long-distance communication was possible solely through paper-based letters, which could possibly take months to reach the recipient.There are, however, some drawbacks to online communication, in particular the possibility that the lack of contact brought by technological advancements could potentially weaken human bonds. Taking into consideration that humans are sociable species, this could pose a dire threat to our mental health. This predicament, however, would be mitigated by the extra free time technological developments create for us. This free time could be spent with friends and family and in the long run would strengthen our relationships and improve our emotional wellbeing.To recapitulate, the Internet’s demolishing the need for person-to-person contact brings about numerous benefits. A more sustainable environment as well as more free time generated for individuals, a reduced need to commute in addition to the feasibility of conducting long-distance communication in the easiest way possible, are all instances of the above-mentioned merits.;The advent of the Internet has revolutionized the way we live, work, and interact with one another. One of the most significant merits of using the Internet as a means of making purchases, working, and communicating is the lowered demand for transport. With the ability to shop, work, and connect with others online, the need to physically travel to stores, offices, and meeting places is greatly reduced. This, in turn, leads to a decreased volume of transportation on our roads, resulting in fewer harmful gas emissions that contribute to air pollution and climate change.The reduction in commuting burden is another significant advantage of using the Internet for daily activities. With the ability to work from home or remote locations, individuals can avoid the daily grind of traveling to and from work, saving time, money, and energy. This yields more free time for individuals, which can be used for leisure, personal development, or spending time with family and friends. Moreover, the reduced commuting time also leads to a decrease in stress levels, as individuals are no longer exposed to the hustle and bustle of daily traffic.The environmental and social benefits of using the Internet as a means of making purchases, working, and communicating are undeniable. As the world continues to urbanize and populations grow, it is essential that we adopt sustainable and eco-friendly practices to mitigate the negative impacts of human activity on the environment. By leveraging the Internet to reduce our transportation needs, we can create a more sustainable, productive, and balanced lifestyle. In conclusion, the merits of using the Internet for daily activities are multifaceted, and by embracing this technology, we can create a better future for ourselves and for generations to come.
1344;In the past people wore their traditional clothes, but these days most people wear similar clothes, is this a positive or negative development?;In the past, people wore their traditional clothes and followed their culture. These days, most people wear similar clothes and therefore look very similar to one another. Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?Sample EssayThese days, people’s perspectives on the value of clothing are changing, and individuals tend to wear similar clothing compared to people in the past who opted for their traditional clothing. I believe this tendency exerts a positive influence on the society.It is certainly true that there are some drawbacks to this tendency because it may lead to a loss of global diversity. It can be argued those who wear ordinary clothes such as T-shirts and jeans cannot feel a connection to their roots, and they are likely to neglect their culture and the contribution of their ancestors. Therefore, these people may not take pride in their region, and they might migrate to an urban location rather than contribute to the development of their community. Consequently, many ethnic minorities could suffer from depopulation and eventually disappear.However, I believe that there are more positives than negatives in people opting for similar clothes. The first explanation is that individuals can feel a sense of unity with people all over the world even though they have different religions and ways of life. This would motivate people in the world to support one another, instead of thinking that different parts of the world should deal with their own problems when natural disasters and other terrible problems occur in different nations. Furthermore, this tendency is economically profitable. Generally speaking, as ordinary clothes are automatically manufactured, they can be produced faster and more affordably than traditional clothing such as Japanese Kimono, which is hand-crafted.In conclusion, although people today tend to wear similar clothes instead of traditional ones and this trend cause several problems, I believe that the society as a whole can reap more benefits of this tendency.All parts of the task have been covered. The writer presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt with suitable, widely covered and sufficiently supported ideas. The paragraphing is handled appropriately. The range of vocabulary allows the writer to convey the intended meaning. The overall control of grammar and punctuation is fine, with only a few errors mostly related to word choice (hover/tap on corrections in blue for details). Well done! Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;The world has undergone significant changes over the years, and one of the most notable changes is in the way people dress. In the past, people took great pride in wearing their traditional clothes and adhering to their cultural norms. This not only reflected their identity but also showcased the rich diversity of their community. However, in recent times, there has been a shift towards wearing similar clothes, with people from different cultures and backgrounds donning similar attire.While some may argue that this is a positive development, as it promotes unity and equality, I believe that it is a negative trend. The loss of traditional clothing and cultural diversity is a significant blow to the unique identities of different communities. When people wear similar clothes, they tend to look very similar to one another, which can lead to a loss of individuality and cultural expression. This homogenization of fashion can make it difficult to distinguish between different cultures and communities, leading to a loss of cultural heritage and diversity.Moreover, the adoption of similar clothing styles can also lead to the erosion of traditional skills and practices, such as textile production and embroidery, which are often passed down from generation to generation. This can have a significant impact on the cultural and economic well-being of communities that rely on these traditional practices.In conclusion, while the shift towards wearing similar clothes may have some benefits, such as promoting unity and equality, I believe that the negative consequences outweigh the positive. The loss of cultural diversity and individuality, as well as the erosion of traditional skills and practices, make this a negative development. It is essential that we preserve and promote our cultural heritage, including our traditional clothing and customs, to ensure that future generations can continue to appreciate and learn from our rich cultural diversity.
641;"Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference. To what extent do you agree or disagree?";There is no doubt these days that the action of the individual is not powerful enough to make the environment better. Unless through laws created by the government and activities have been taken by companies that have a high impact. I strongly disagree with this idea. because there are other ways to help the government as an individual.In essay will prove my point with reasons and examples.Nowadays, people can use social media as a platform that has the power to tell people around the world how to behave. Therefore, an individual has the power to convince others to give higher attention to our environment and create a community that has specific goals to improve. For example, social media influencers could educate the volunteer and work with the youth to make the environment better. For instance, show the young people how to sort the waste and how dangerous the impact is if they do not act in such as way.Moreover, as individuals, people can start doing many actions which benefit the environment by themselves without obstructions. On the other hand, the government and companies should be aware too. For example, while the companies use the factories the government must be monitoring the discharge of fule.In conclusion, after carefully explaining my points of view, in my opinion, it is not necessary to wait for the government and the big companies to act activity for the environment because we as individuals can create and provide educational activities for the public to preserve the environment for the next generation.;The notion that individual actions are insufficient to bring about significant environmental improvements has become a widely accepted fact in today's world. As the planet grapples with the challenges of climate change, pollution, and conservation, it has become increasingly evident that collective effort is necessary to effect meaningful change. This essay will argue that individual actions, as powerful as they may be, are no longer enough to make a substantial difference in improving the environment, and will provide reasons and examples to support this claim.One of the primary reasons why individual actions fall short is the sheer scale of environmental problems. Climate change, for instance, is a global issue that requires a collective response. No matter how diligently an individual recycles, uses public transport, or reduces their carbon footprint, their efforts are dwarfed by the massive scale of industrial pollution and deforestation. Furthermore, the impact of individual actions is often mitigated by the actions of others. For example, one person's decision to use eco-friendly products can be negated by a neighbor's reckless use of harmful chemicals.However, social media has emerged as a powerful tool that can be leveraged to inspire collective action. Platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram can be used to raise awareness about environmental issues, promote eco-friendly behaviors, and mobilize people to take action. For instance, social media campaigns have been instrumental in organizing global protests against climate change, promoting the use of reusable bags and water bottles, and encouraging people to adopt plant-based diets. By harnessing the power of social media, individuals can amplify their voices, influence others, and contribute to a broader movement for environmental change. In conclusion, while individual actions are important, they are no longer sufficient to address the environmental challenges we face. It is through collective action, facilitated by the power of social media, that we can hope to make a meaningful difference.
1237;"Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.";"Pollution free environment is important for our life's health and even enjoyement.Everyone whether an individual or large entitiy has an impact on the environment; regardless whether it was good or bad. Hence, I believe it is the responsibility of individulas as well as governments and large companies.Individuals can do a lot to improve the environemt around them starting with taking some actions to make a difference. For example, every memeber in the sociaty can support recycling efforts by sorting their garbages into different categoreis, instead of wasting the efforts of recycling companies to do so. Another exmaple would be to stop using plastic products and replace them with more environemt friendly products like pepar products.Moreover, teaching and spreading awarness about the importance of keeping our environemt clean are another way to make a difference. For instance, we can use social media to spread awarness and start campaigns about enviorment and pollution. Furthermore, we can teach some classes in schools and universities about this subject. As a result, this will help the upcoming generations to understand the problem and have them continue the efforts of improvement.While individuals efforts are essential, they must be supported by governments and large companies in order to complete the circle. A main example here would be establishing regulations and laws that would minimze the damage to the environment and maintain pollution at low levels, which is the role of the governments around the world. As for large companies, they can support by adopting the best practicies and take the proper actions to reduce pollution and improve the environment. As an example, they can start using clean and renewable energies to power their facilities and plants. In addition, those companies can develop technologies that contributes toward keeping the environment safe, and prompet the use of clean energy and vehicales.To sum up, the responsibility to improve the environemt must be divided between all three parties individuals, governments, and large companies. Each has his role to enhnace the environemnt and reduce the pollution. They complete each other and they should work together toward a better future for our world.";A pollution-free environment is crucial for maintaining good health and overall enjoyment of life. The air we breathe, the water we drink, and the land we inhabit all play a significant role in determining the quality of our existence. Unfortunately, human activities have led to the degradation of our environment, posing a significant threat to our well-being. It is imperative to recognize that every individual, organization, and government has a profound impact on the environment, and therefore, a shared responsibility to protect it.As individuals, our daily choices and actions can either contribute to pollution or mitigate it. Simple actions such as reducing plastic use, conserving water, and recycling can make a significant difference when practiced collectively. However, the impact of individual actions, though important, is limited compared to the vast scale of environmental degradation caused by large entities such as corporations and governments. These organizations have the capacity to implement policies and practices that can significantly reduce pollution on a much larger scale.Governments and large companies have a moral and ethical responsibility to prioritize environmental sustainability. They must adopt and enforce strict environmental regulations, invest in renewable energy sources, and promote sustainable practices throughout their operations. Moreover, governments can play a pivotal role by creating and enforcing laws that protect natural resources and penalize polluters. Corporate entities can innovate sustainable technologies and practices, reducing their carbon footprint and setting examples for others to follow.In conclusion, achieving a pollution-free environment is a collective responsibility that requires the active participation of individuals, governments, and large companies. Each entity, regardless of its size or influence, has a role to play in protecting our environment. By working together and recognizing the importance of environmental conservation, we can ensure a healthier, more enjoyable life for current and future generations. It is our shared duty to act now and make sustainable choices to preserve the beauty and health of our planet.
1301;It is a fact that the majority of people who are sent to prison commit further crime after their release.What is causing this? What can be done to change this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is a sad fact that criminals who leave prison go on to commit further crime. There are various reasons for this, but there are also some things that can be done to prevent it from happening.One reason for this recidivism is due to a lack of legitimate income. Many people turn to crime as they cannot find an alternative to earn money. When such person comes out of prison, it is very often the case that they have the same few opportunities for a legitimate income. In fact, these opportunities will even be reduced, as employers are often less willing to give an ex-prisoner a job. Some people also return to crime, as they spend all the time of their prison sentence with other criminals. This is not a great environment for rehabilitation, and sometimes even a network of contacts can be made to help develop criminal activities on release.One important way to help address this problem is education. Criminals who have turned to illegal activities because of no alternatives to earn a living need to learn a way to earn a wage, such as a trade or vocational skills. Computer skills, for example, are in high demand and someone trained in these could very possibly find work. In addition, governments can offer incentives to employers to attract them to give jobs to newly-released prisoners. This would help people who don’t really want to return to crime achieve a fresh start. As keeping people in prison is an expensive business, governments might find it cheaper to pay these incentives.To sum up, people returning to crime is a tragedy that should be avoided if at all possible in today’s society. Education and incentives can directly address the reasons for it and could make society a happier and safer place.;The revolving door of crime is a persistent issue in many societies, where individuals who have served their time in prison often go on to commit further crimes. This phenomenon is a complex problem with multiple underlying causes. One of the primary reasons is the lack of rehabilitation and support provided to prisoners during their incarceration, which can lead to a cycle of recidivism. Additionally, socio-economic factors such as poverty, unemployment, and limited access to education and job opportunities can also contribute to an individual's likelihood of reoffending.However, there are measures that can be taken to break this cycle and prevent further crime from occurring. Education and incentives are two key strategies that can directly address the root causes of recidivism. By providing prisoners with access to education and vocational training, they can acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to secure employment and become productive members of society. Incentives, such as reduced sentences or parole, can also motivate individuals to participate in rehabilitation programs and make positive changes to their behavior.Implementing these strategies can have a profound impact on reducing crime rates and creating a safer and happier society. By empowering individuals with education and incentives, we can help them to overcome the challenges that led to their initial incarceration and provide them with a second chance to reintegrate into society. Furthermore, this approach can also have long-term benefits,.such as reducing the economic burden of crime on society and promoting community cohesion and trust. Ultimately, by addressing the underlying causes of recidivism and providing support and opportunities to those who have been incarcerated, we can create a more just and equitable society for all.
1336;It is believed that people who read for pleasure develop their imagination more and acquire better language skills compared to people who prefer watching television. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Some people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. Personally, I support this opinion for several reasons, which will be laid out in this essay.As we all know, books use text to convey ideas and quite often there are no images or illustrations to picture the scenes described in the book; therefore, we have to use our own imagination while reading. For example, reading a fantasy novel that contains mythical creatures one would normally see the appearance of those characters in their mind while following the plot. In contrast, movie heroes on a TV screen are usually created for the viewer by directors and producers of the film. Watching TV substitutes the need to develop one’s own imagination because the characters and their surroundings are shown on the screen.Furthermore, it is argued that reading is the best way to expand one’s vocabulary. The reader learns the correct spelling of a word by seeing it printed in a book, and they grasp its meaning from the context, without having to look it up in a dictionary. Not only new words but also numerous sentence structures can be learnt from books. To take advantage of these benefits English teachers in many schools use English novels as teaching materials. Students are asked to read the story and capture the keywords to answer the questions in the exam. In comparison, learning new words while watching a TV show isn’t always easy because the viewer’s attention is drawn to the action on the screen and if there are no subtitles, the spelling of the words is not obvious. All this makes a book a more effective tool for a language learner compared to TV.In conclusion, I believe people who love to read tend to have a more active imagination and advanced linguistic comprehension than those who watch television, since readers are required to imagine the story in the book and learn the meaning of new words from the context.";The debate about the impact of reading and watching television on language skills and creativity has been ongoing for years. Some people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. I support this opinion for several reasons. Firstly, reading exposes individuals to a wide range of vocabulary, which helps to improve their language skills. Through reading, one comes across various words, phrases, and expressions that may not be commonly used in everyday conversation. This exposure enables readers to expand their vocabulary, understand different contexts, and develop their writing and speaking skills.On the other hand, watching television, although entertaining, does not provide the same level of linguistic benefits as reading. Television shows and movies often use dialogue that is simplistic and limited, which may not challenge viewers to think critically or expand their vocabulary. Furthermore, reading stimulates creativity by allowing individuals to imagine and visualize characters, settings, and plotlines. This mental exercise fosters critical thinking, problem-solving, and innovative ideas. In contrast, watching television presents a more passive experience, where visuals and storylines are already created, leaving little room for imagination and creativity.Additionally, reading requires active engagement and concentration, which helps to improve focus, analytical thinking, and comprehension. These skills are essential for academic and professional success, and are not typically developed through watching television. In conclusion, the benefits of reading in enhancing language skills and creativity far outweigh those of watching television. By reading, individuals can improve their vocabulary, develop their critical thinking, and foster creativity, making it an essential activity for personal and intellectual growth. As such, I firmly believe that reading is the superior choice for those seeking to enhance their language skills and creativity.
753;It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals.

This essay will discuss the importance of teaching these subjects to young students, arguing that the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. By incorporating animal care and agriculture into their studies,Learning about animal care and agriculture is crucial for primary school students as it equips them with essential life skills. Firstly, understanding how to care for animals promotes empathy, responsibility, and compassion. Students learn about the needs of animals, how to provide them with proper shelter, nutrition, and health care. This not only helps them become better pet owners but also fosters a sense of respect and appreciation for all living creatures. Furthermore, learning about agriculture teaches students how to grow their own fruits and vegetables, instilling in them the value of self-sufficiency and the importance of sustainable living.The advantages of teaching animal care and agriculture in primary schools are numerous. For one, it encourages children to adopt healthy eating habits by teaching them about the origin of their food and the effort required to produce it. Secondly, it helps them develop a deeper appreciation for the environment and the interconnectedness of ecosystems. By learning about these subjects, students can make informed choices about their lifestyle, contributing to a more sustainable future. While some may argue that these subjects divert attention from core academics, the benefits they provide in terms of holistic development and practical knowledge make them invaluable additions to the curriculum.In conclusion, the introduction of animal care and general agriculture into primary school education is a forward-thinking move. It's very important for students to study and understand how to grow vegetables and how to keep animals, as these skills will benefit them throughout their lives. By embracing these subjects, primary schools can help shape a generation that is not only academically proficient but also environmentally conscious, responsible, and self-sufficient. The long-term advantages of incorporating these subjects into the curriculum clearly outweigh any perceived disadvantages, making them a valuable and necessary part of a well-rounded education.
1296;It is the responsibility of individuals to save and provide for their own retirement. Governments have no obligation to provide this benefit.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The responsibility for providing funds for retirement is incredibly important and something that is often overlooked by younger people. Some believe it is the responsibility of the individual to plan for this, but others feel it is the responsibility of the state.People who believe that the state should be responsible for funding retirees, base their argument on the fact that in most countries, people pay taxes and social charges to the government. This money, they argue, should also go towards the provision of a pension for the person paying the tax. In addition, those who have very small or no income, pay little or no tax and do not have the ability to provide for themselves. The government, therefore, in its role of caring for the population, has an obligation to pay a pension and provide other social benefits, such as medical treatment.Many others, however, feel that it is the responsibility of individuals to fund their own retirements. As adults, they argue, people should be able to set aside and invest money throughout their lifetime, so that they can retire with few financial worries. In many countries the government has legislated a framework allowing and encouraging citizens to save up and accumulate sufficient funds for the period after their working years have ended.I neither agree nor disagree with the statement, but rather my opinion takes in parts of both arguments. I feel that people should be responsible for saving money to fund their retirement, but I also feel that individuals who have not had the chance to do so should be supported by the government out of taxes. In my view, therefore, it is wrong to say that governments have no obligation to help people in this area. Governments are there to support the entire population of their countries, which includes the poorer elements of society.;The question of who should bear the responsibility of planning for retirement has sparked a heated debate. On one hand, some people believe that it is the individual's duty to plan and save for their retirement, arguing that they have the freedom to make their own financial decisions and should be prepared to face the consequences. On the other hand, others feel that it is the state's responsibility to fund retirees, as they have contributed to the economy and society throughout their working lives.In my opinion, it is wrong to say that governments have no obligation to help retirees. Governments have a moral and social responsibility to ensure that their citizens are able to live with dignity and security in their old age. Many individuals have worked hard and paid taxes throughout their lives, and it is only fair that they receive some form of support in their retirement. Furthermore, governments have the resources and infrastructure to provide a safety net for retirees, which would be difficult for individuals to replicate on their own.Moreover, leaving retirement planning solely to individuals can lead to significant inequalities and hardships, particularly for those who have limited financial resources or have experienced financial setbacks. A state-funded retirement system can help to alleviate poverty and ensure that all citizens, regardless of their financial situation, are able to enjoy a basic level of comfort and security in their old age. Therefore, while individuals should still take some responsibility for their own retirement planning, governments have a crucial role to play in supporting and ensuring the well-being of their retired citizens.
1287;It must be a woman who stays at home to care for children. Men are not suited to this kind of work. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Traditionally in many parts of the world, it has been women who have stayed at home to care for children. This has led to the ideology and expectation that women are more suited to this type of work than men.The overwhelming status quo where women stay at home to care for the children probably derives from the fact that women are the ones who have to actually give birth to children and, following that, they are the ones who for the early part of a child’s life have to feed the child until it is weaned. In times past, this state of affairs probably led to the women assuming the permanent role of carer for the home and children, whilst men went out to work, whether it was to gather food or work in fields or factories.In spite of the fact that this became what was expected in family dynamics, it does not mean that men are necessarily less suited to caring for a child than women. It is very possible for men to care for a child, even from birth onwards in today’s world. Babies’ milk formula can be mixed by anyone and fed to a child. The fact that many women today choose not to do this again does not mean that they are better suited by nature to care for the child.Suitability for childcare is a matter for individual temperament and aptitude. Not many people, whether they are men or women, feel totally confident and knowledgeable about how to care for a baby or young child at the start. They need advice from their own mothers and fathers, midwives or from books. It is only from experience that skill with childcare comes and this skill can be acquired regardless of gender.All in all, I do not agree with the statement that men are less suited to childcare than women. I believe that aptitude to look after children is a matter of individual temperament, not gender-specific inherited qualities.;The traditional notion of childcare has often been associated with women, who have historically been expected to stay at home and care for their children. This stereotype has led many to believe that men are less capable of providing adequate care for children. However, the assumption that men are inherently less suited to caring for children than women is a misconception. In reality, the ability to care for children is not determined by gender, but rather by individual temperament and personal characteristics. Men and women alike can possess the necessary qualities to provide excellent care for children, such as patience, empathy, and nurturing abilities. It is unfair to generalize that one gender is more suited to childcare than the other, as this can lead to unnecessary limitations and stereotypes.Moreover, with the changing dynamics of modern families, it is becoming increasingly common for men to take on a more active role in childcare. Many fathers are now staying at home to care for their children, and are proving to be just as capable and loving as mothers. This shift in societal norms highlights that childcare is not exclusive to women, and that men can be equally effective caregivers.Ultimately, the aptitude to look after children is a matter of individual personality and character, rather than gender-specific inherited qualities. As we move towards a more egalitarian society, it is essential to recognize and appreciate the valuable contributions that both men and women can make to childcare. By doing so, we can work to break down outdated stereotypes and create a more inclusive and supportive environment for all families, regardless of their composition or structure.
1105;It's generally believed that success in fields such as art and sport can only be achieved if a person has natural talent. However, it's sometimes claimed that any child can be taught to become a good sports person or artist.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"It is common to think that in fields like art or sport success is linked to natural talent, even though it is stated that children can obtain good results also trough learning and pratice.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------In my opinion, I believe that only a combination of natural talent and sacrifice can lead you to obtain success; for this reason, you can learn and improve several skills, but you will not win against a person with this type of gift, unless this person does not pratice enough.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------To provide an example, if we think about Raffaello, one of the most remarkable painters of all times, and his life we may be disappointed; in fact, thanks to his natural talent he started to paint since he was 8.However, we have to bear in mind that he constantly made a research in order to discover new techniques and to gain new inspirations.If he was not so focused on his art's improvement, he would not be able to paint an entire church.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------If we move to another field as sport is always more evident the existence of a pattern. Indeed, it is crystal clear that professional players need to pratice everyday, regardless their talent.However, Ronaldo this year has winned the nominee for the best football player in the world not only for his innate talent but also for the effort put during training in order to reach always an higher goal.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------In conclusion, through commitment you will obtain good results, but to achieve the highest level you must be gifted with a natural talent.";The age-old debate about the key to success in fields like art and sport has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that natural talent is the primary determinant of success, others claim that learning and practice can bridge the gap. In my opinion, the truth lies somewhere in between. I firmly believe that a combination of natural talent and sacrifice is the ultimate recipe for achieving success in these domains.On one hand, natural talent undoubtedly plays a significant role in laying the foundation for success. Individuals who possess a natural inclination towards a particular field often exhibit a level of innate ability that sets them apart from others. However, relying solely on talent is not enough. Without dedication and perseverance, the raw talent can go to waste.On the other hand, learning and practice are essential components in honing one's skills and perfecting their craft. Children who are given the opportunity to learn and practice can indeed achieve remarkable results, even if they do not possess exceptional natural talent. Nevertheless, the journey to success is rarely a smooth one, and it is here that sacrifice comes into play. The countless hours of practice, the early mornings, and the missed social events all constitute the sacrifices that one must make in pursuit of excellence.In conclusion, while natural talent and learning are both crucial elements, it is the combination of these factors, coupled with the willingness to make sacrifices, that ultimately leads to success in fields like art and sport. It is this synergy that enables individuals to push beyond their limits, to overcome obstacles, and to achieve greatness. Therefore, I firmly believe that a fusion of natural talent and sacrifice is the key to unlocking true success in these fields.
1420;Learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Evaluation of the importance of timing is essential, past to show the importance of their present, while that to even remember their past because it would not help them at all. It is a very controversial and complicated matter., many people believe this statement, for many reasons. Firstly, all of us had made many mistakes which we would not like to remember, they will affect their present because they can create some problems with our families example. Secondly, instead of remembering those past trials, one should get the benefits of their present.Regardless of what I said previously, many people are sticking to their past to give themselves a push in their present. It can give a way of learning from mistakes, and a good chance to try to avoid anything that once lead to a past failure.Moreover, success will not come without failure, everybody should make an attempt, even if it fails, and it may become a big success if they try it again and again. In addition, our past is our culture and heritage which we should not forget at all, it is a matter of value to our present and future, and will remain such till the day will die.To sum up, in my opinion, we can not live without a past, it is our value of life. it can help create your experiences and solve your problems better in the future.;The significance of the past in shaping our lives cannot be overstated. In my opinion, we cannot live without a past, as it is the foundation upon which our present and future are built. Our past experiences, both joyful and tumultuous, serve as the cornerstone of our personal growth and development. It is through these experiences that we learn valuable lessons, forge lasting memories, and develop the wisdom that guides us through life's challenges.The past plays a pivotal role in creating our experiences and equipping us with the skills necessary to navigate the complexities of life. The trials and tribulations we face, the successes we achieve, and the relationships we foster all contribute to a rich tapestry of experience that informs our decisions and actions in the present. By reflecting on our past,,ed experiences, we can identify patterns of behavior, both positive and negative, and make conscious choices to replicate or alter them as we move forward.Moreover, our past is instrumental in helping us solve problems more effectively in the future. The challenges we overcome and the mistakes we make provide us with a unique perspective and insight, enabling us to approach similar problems with a deeper understanding and more nuanced strategy.

It is the value of life that gives our existence depth, meaning, and direction. By embracing and learning from our past, we empower ourselves to live more fulfilling, resilient, and purpose-driven lives. Therefore, it is essential that we acknowledge, appreciate, and integrate the lessons of our past into our present and future, for it is through this integration that we can truly thrive and reach our full potential.

Advantages of learning about the past are also on the side of the ones who personally know themselves very well and stay honest to themselves at all times.For example, someone who try to be someone, acting to please influent people or trying to get somewhere he or she would not be able to if he were playing real, could be embarrassed by their own mistakes or feeling humiliated when looking back to what he accomplished to get where he/she is now ; therefore the past in this situation would not be a great option for him to look back after.Despite this kind of personality, there are lots of people who find out constructive knowledge in looking back to the past, regardless of how great or bad it could be.The kind of people who actually face their own past and do not try to hide it are the ones who are not scared of how people will judge them, but are willing to make greate changes in their future.It is ,to me, the definition of true progress; how could we learn from our own experiences if we are not willing to face ourselves ?Past can be hurtful but I do think that everything we have been through is a constructive lesson for today and tomorrow.";Learning about the past is a complex and multifaceted topic that can have both advantages and disadvantages, depending on one's position in life.

1297;Many cities have areas where the only cars are taxis and buses.Is this a positive or a negative development? What are the effects of this on individuals and society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Banning cars from the centre of various cities around the world has been a strategy to reduce pollution and encourage people to use public transport. It has had various positive effects for both individuals and for society as a whole.Banning cars from the centre of cities seems to be a very positive development. Fewer cars on the road means less pollution and fewer fossil fuel resources being used up. Although the effect on resources might be relatively negligible, it can create a newer way of thinking regarding the dynamics of transport within cities and this could be the most important benefit to society. Some people working in the centre of these cities may complain about inconvenience, but many would agree that this is a small price to pay.A reduction in the reliance of people on private vehicles is likely to encourage them to use public transport or even bicycles. Using public transport, especially the types that run on clean sources of power, will significantly raise air quality levels in cities, which will of course benefit everyone. The clean air could even further encourage the use of bicycles, which would in turn promote more healthy lifestyles and less obesity. This would contribute on an individual level to people’s well-being and a better and longer life, and on a societal level, it would lessen the strain on public health resources. Governments could encourage this by creating more bicycle lanes to make cycling easier and safer.In conclusion, it is clear that banning cars from the centre of cities is significantly beneficial. Better health and ecology, as well as improvement in longevity and well-being can benefit individuals and the entire society.;The decision to ban cars from the centre of cities has proven to be a highly effective strategy in reducing pollution and promoting the use of public transport. By restricting vehicle access to these areas, cities have been able to significantly decrease the amount of pollutants emitted into the air, resulting in a healthier environment for residents and visitors alike.One of the most notable benefits of this approach is the reduction in air pollution. With fewer cars on the road, there is a substantial decrease in the emission of harmful gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and particulate matter. This, in turn, leads to a decrease in respiratory problems and other health issues associated with poor air quality. Furthermore, the reduction in pollution also contributes to a decrease in the environmental degradation, preserving the city's natural beauty and historic landmarks for future generations.In addition to the environmental benefits, banning cars from city centres has also had a positive impact on the lifestyle and habits of individuals. With the absence of cars, pedestrians and cyclists are able to navigate the city with greater ease and safety, promoting a more active and healthy lifestyle. Moreover, the increased use of public transport encourages a sense of community and social interaction among commuters, which can lead to a more cohesive and connected society.Overall, the strategy of banning cars from city centres has yielded numerous positive effects for both individuals and society as a whole. By reducing pollution, promoting public transport, and encouraging a healthier lifestyle, cities can become more sustainable, livable, and environmentally conscious. As the world continues to urbanize, this approach serves as a valuable model for cities to adopt, ultimately contributing to a better quality of life for their inhabitants.
1332;Many countries are experiencing population growth and need to build more homes. Some say that new homes should be constructed in existing cities while others argue that new towns should be built to accommodate the growing population. What are the advantages and disadvantages of these points of view?;In the past two decades, there has been an exponential increase in the migration of people to different cities and countries, indirectly resulting in a considerable infrastructure development. However, there has been a long-standing debate on whether to direct these infrastructure projects to current cities or establish new counties. Careful consideration of both alternatives reveals that each has its positives and negatives.One of the major advantages of focusing on current cities for new construction is that it would benefit the residents of the cities in multiple ways. Tenants living in Vancouver would prefer to buy a newly constructed house in the city where they work rather than in a new town, to reduce their commute time. Moreover, the city has everything they desire such as efficient public transport, thriving job market and affordable healthcare. This would not be possible in new towns because of the time it takes to establish services and generate opportunities for people.On the other hand, accommodating people in houses built in newly created towns would put them in a pollution-free and clean environment. This is because new towns may take at least 10 years of time to become an attractive spot for people and industries alike. As a result, their exposure to harmful emissions from industrial plants and transportation is reduced, shielding them from the risks of acquiring health complications. A recent report released by the word Health Organization (WHO) suggests that the number of people affected by airborne infections is 20% higher in cities compared to new towns that were formed just a couple of years ago.In conclusion, while there are both positive and negative aspects to these views, the decision on where to build the new homes to accommodate increasing population will depend on many other factors as well. Therefore, a thorough assessment is required before starting an infrastructure project.;The debate on whether to focus infrastructure projects on existing cities or establish new counties has been ongoing for a considerable amount of time. This dilemma presents two distinct approaches, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, directing resources towards the development of new towns offers a multitude of benefits. For instance, accommodating people in houses built in these newly created towns would provide them with the opportunity to live in a pollution-free and clean environment. This is particularly significant given the escalating concerns about environmental degradation and public health in densely populated urban areas.Newly established counties can be designed with sustainability and environmental conservation in mind, incorporating green spaces, efficient waste management systems, and renewable energy sources. This not only enhances the quality of life for residents but also contributes to a reduction in the carbon footprint of these new settlements. Furthermore, the infrastructure in new towns can be planned and implemented with modern, environmentally friendly technologies from the outset, avoiding the need for costly retrofits and renovations that often plague older cities.Additionally, establishing new counties can help alleviate the pressure on existing urban infrastructure, which in many cases is already operating at or beyond capacity. By distributing population growth across new areas, it's possible to prevent the exacerbation of issues such as traffic congestion, housing shortages, and strain on public services that are commonly associated with rapid urbanization. While there are valid arguments for focusing development on current cities, including the potential for revitalization and the efficiency of leveraging existing infrastructure, the benefits of creating new, sustainable communities are compelling. Ultimately, a balanced approach that considers both the renovation of existing cities and the strategic development of new areas may offer the most comprehensive solution to the challenges of urban growth and environmental sustainability.
1327;Many people argue that museums and art galleries should present the nation’s art, as opposed to artworks from other countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The cultural value of engaging with museums and art galleries is unquestionable; they exert a great deal of influence on our perception of the world. It is only reasonable to ponder whether or not these outlets of culture should concentrate their efforts on presenting the nation’s own art, and not that of other countries. In my opinion, there should be an attempt to strike a balance and put the objects of national art in the spotlight, while allowing the public to get acquainted with foreign artworks to a certain extent.If people were to only find sculptures and paintings by national artists in their local museums, that would have a number of positive effects, such as the fame the artists of that country would gain and the pride its citizens would feel for their fellow countrymen. It would promote patriotism and strengthen the image of the country in the eyes of its inhabitants. Local artists would also receive more financial assistance from the government as their works would generate a significant amount of interest, potentially resulting in further development of the local art. However, in order to evolve art needs fresh ideas, and without exposure to a wider range of creativity the world provides, the evolution of local arts may be hindered.People enjoy art because it appeals to their inner sense of beauty and triggers strong emotions, and whether the masterpiece that causes these feelings belongs to a local or foreign artist is irrelevant. Talent knows no geographical boundaries; therefore, the emphasis should be on how much joy or amazement the work of art brings, rather than on its origin. If that principle were to be followed, we would never have to choose between local and international art. Reducing our museums or galleries’ collections to local art works, in my view, would be harmful and go against the democratic nature of art.To sum up, it seems to me that a country has nothing to lose by allowing its people to admire art created elsewhere in the world. A conscious choice by the government to support local artists while hosting exhibitions from other countries could prove the most beneficial.";The cultural value of engaging with museums and art galleries is unquestionable. These institutions serve as hubs for creativity, education, and cultural enrichment, providing a platform for people to experience and appreciate the world's most iconic and thought-provoking works of art. However, this raises an important question: should museums and art galleries focus primarily on showcasing the nation's own art, or should they also feature works from other countries?On one hand, concentrating on a nation's own art can foster a sense of national pride and identity. By highlighting the unique cultural heritage and artistic traditions of a country, museums and galleries can play a vital role in preserving and promoting national culture. This approach can also provide a platform for local artists to gain recognition and exposure, which can be beneficial for the development of the national art scene.On the other hand, it can be argued that museums and art galleries have a responsibility to showcase a diverse range of artistic styles and movements from around the world. By featuring international art, these institutions can facilitate cross-cultural understanding and exchange, allowing visitors to experience and appreciate different artistic perspectives and traditions. This can broaden people's cultural horizons, foster empathy and tolerance, and promote global cultural awareness.Ultimately, a balanced approach may be the most effective way forward. Museums and art galleries can prioritize showcasing the nation's own art while also incorporating international works to provide a comprehensive and inclusive cultural experience. By doing so, these institutions can promote national culture while also celebrating the diversity and richness of global art, thereby enriching the cultural lives of their visitors.
955;Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?;Numerous experts think that every country should be capable to produce more materials and commodities. I agree with this argument as it brings benefits to countries and I will highlight some of them.To begin with, manufacturing goods is essential to any country as it helps to build their economy. Increasing production power assist them to export more and it also makes them less dependent on other countries. For instance, China is one of the largest producers in the world in any goods which also makes them the largest exporter. Such development in production power contributes to their gross domestic product.Another reason is that extra produced goods can be used in emergencies, such emergencies are pandemics, financial crises and many more. By growing the production of goods and materials, a country will always be a reliable business partner. Thus, companies will reach out to them and become loyal partners. Moreover, countries should be aware that by increasing their production. For example, there is a semiconductor chip crisis is going on all over the world and no country in the world is able to meet the demands of chips. On the contrary, India is now planning to satisfy the demand for chips by strengthening its manufacturing capacity to a massive level while it will directly contribute to their economy and also generate job opportunities.To conclude, I agree that more in-house production is necessary. It is extremely crucial to produce more needed products in order to consistently outperform the rest of the world and also it brings many beneficial things like generating job opportunities and a rise in the Gross domestic product of a country.;The notion that every country should be capable of producing its own materials and commodities has garnered significant support from experts worldwide. I concur with this argument, as it yields numerous benefits for countries, which I will outline in this essay. To commence, manufacturing goods is pivotal to any country's economic foundation, as it plays a crucial role in building and sustaining a robust economy.By producing their own goods, countries can reduce their reliance on foreign imports, thereby decreasing their trade deficits and promoting economic self-sufficiency. This, in turn, can lead to an increase in domestic employment opportunities, as local industries expand to meet the demand for goods. Moreover, producing domestically can also enhance the quality of goods, as countries can implement and enforce their own quality control standards, ensuring that products meet the needs and expectations of their citizens.Furthermore, self-sufficiency in production can also lead to technological advancements and innovations, as countries invest in research and development to improve their manufacturing capabilities. This can have a ripple effect, where technological advancements in one sector can benefit other industries, leading to a more diversified and resilient economy. Additionally, producing their own materials and commodities can also enhance a country's food and energy security, as they are less dependent on foreign supplies, which can be unpredictable and subject to fluctuations in global markets.In conclusion, the ability of every country to produce its own materials and commodities is essential for building a strong and sustainable economy. It not only reduces reliance on foreign imports but also promotes domestic employment, technological innovation, and enhances food and energy security. As such, I firmly believe that countries should strive to develop their manufacturing capabilities, to reap the numerous benefits that come with being self-sufficient in production. By doing so, countries can ensure a more prosperous and secure future for their citizens.
1290;Many people believe that studying at university is the best way to develop oneself, learn new skills and find a well-paid job. Other people believe that more is learned from getting a job straight away after school and learning whilst working.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;There are many ways to learn new knowledge and skills. Traditional educational routes, such as school followed by college or university is one route that is generally accepted and respected by today’s society. It can be argued, however, that this is not always the best way. A more vocational route can be more appropriate for certain people and for particular jobs.Universities generally have deference given to them and, due to this, most schools tailor their programs to help students get university admission. Universities usually have respected and highly qualified teachers who have the knowledge and the skills to take their students to very high levels of knowledge and expertise. The very difficulty of gaining admission, getting through the duration of the course and passing final exams ensures to employers that graduates have the necessary self-discipline, intelligence and ability to get through the courses.Universities are also particularly well suited to the teaching of various subjects, for example, medicine, law and literature and these subjects need students’ full-time attention in order to do well. Although vocational experience is necessary, a certain grounding in basic concepts to a high-level is important. Once this knowledge has been acquired, students can then integrate their knowledge with practical understanding.This, however, is not the case for all areas of learning, especially ones where the quantity of high level knowledge is not required or is possible to be learned whilst working at the same time. Young people studying to be an electrician or a plumber are good examples. To do this work well requires a lot of experience, yet also a sound understanding of theory. The learning here can be and is done working and studying at the same time, often through apprenticeships and vocational courses involving significant amounts of work experience.Therefore, in my opinion, there are more ways than one to acquire a profession. Whether learning should take place at university alone or whilst working depends on the course and the end job.;The path to acquiring knowledge and skills has long been dominated by traditional educational routes. Typically, this involves completing school, followed by college or university. This conventional approach is widely accepted and respected by today's society, as it provides a broad-based education that can be applied to a variety of careers. However, it is not the only route to success, and for certain individuals and professions, a more vocational approach can be more suitable.Vocational training, which focuses on specific skills and hands-on experience, can be highly effective for jobs that require practical expertise, such as trades, technical fields, or creative pursuits. This approach allows learners to develop specialized skills and gain real-world experience, often while earning a salary or stipend. Moreover, vocational routes can be less expensive and time-consuming than traditional university programs, making them an attractive option for those who want to enter the workforce quickly or who may not have the financial means to pursue a degree.Ultimately, whether learning should take place at university alone or while working depends on the course of study and the end job. For fields that require theoretical foundations, such as law, medicine, or engineering, a university education may be essential. On the other hand, for careers that involve hands-on skills, such as construction, culinary arts, or IT, a vocational route or on-the-job training may be more appropriate. Furthermore, many modern professions, such as technology and data science, often require continuous learning and professional development, which can be achieved through a combination of formal education and workplace training. In conclusion, while traditional educational routes remain respected and relevant, a more vocational approach can be a valuable alternative, and the choice between these routes should be based on the specific needs and goals of the individual and the profession they aspire to enter.
1288;Many people in cities today live in high-rise apartment blocks. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this type of living?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;High-rise apartment blocks are a common sight in cities around the world. They are especially popular in large cities and in locations where building land is scarce. Living in such buildings has various advantages and disadvantages for town planners and the inhabitants themselves.The most significant advantage of high-rise apartment blocks is probably for the town planners. With land often being at a premium in large cities, one way to maximise space is to build upwards, so that the population density per square kilometre can be increased. The demand for housing in big cities can therefore be more easily met. There are also disadvantages for town planners. The heavier population density can put added pressure on social facilities, for example sewage and other waste disposal, and the provision of adequate school and medical services.There are also advantages and disadvantages for the actual inhabitants of high-rise apartment blocks. With the demand for housing being reduced, prices are therefore not as high, making housing more affordable. Many people also like not having to be responsible for a garden, and living in an apartment has this advantage. Finally, with so many people living in the same area, many friendships can be made and a community spirit can be built up. It appears the most significant disadvantage is that, in practice, living in high-rise apartment blocks is just not the lifestyle many people want. In some city neighbourhoods, these living spaces can often be associated with poor living conditions and undesirable social elements. In addition, many people view high-rise apartment blocks as being unsafe. For example, in the case of fire, tall buildings are difficult or impossible to evacuate safely.It is clear that high-rise apartment blocks have benefits and drawbacks. It is also clear, however, that due to the need to house increasing numbers of people in cities, these architectural features are here to stay, whether people like them or not.;The proliferation of high-rise apartment blocks has become a ubiquitous feature of urban landscapes worldwide. These towering structures are particularly prevalent in large cities and areas where land for construction is limited. The popularity of high-rise apartments can be attributed to their ability to accommodate a large number of residents in a relatively small footprint,. For town planners, high-rise apartments offer a practical solution to the challenge of providing housing for a growing urban population. They enable maximum utilization of available land, reducing the need for urban sprawl and preserving green spaces. Additionally, high-rise apartments can be designed to incorporate various amenities such as shops, restaurants, and recreational facilities, creating self-sufficient communities that reduce the need for lengthy commutes.However, residents of high-rise apartments often experience a unique set of advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, high-rise living offers stunning views, enhanced security, and access to a range of amenities. Residents may also enjoy a sense of community and social connection with their neighbors. On the other hand, high-rise apartments can be noisy, with thin walls and constant foot traffic. Moreover, the high density of residents can put a strain on local infrastructure and services, such as transportation and waste management.In conclusion, high-rise apartment blocks are a common feature of modern cities, offering a practical solution to urban housing needs. While they present various advantages and disadvantages for both town planners and residents, their popularity is unlikely to wane in the foreseeable future. As cities continue to grow and expand, it is crucial to carefully consider the design and management of high-rise apartments to ensure they provide a livable and sustainable environment for their inhabitants. By doing so, we can harness the benefits of high-rise living while mitigating its drawbacks, creating thriving and resilient urban communities.
789;Many people now undertake extreme activities, from hang-gliding to mountain climbing.Why do people risk their lives in this way, and do you think this is a good trend?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Extreme sports, such as mountain climbing and hand-gliding, have become increasingly popular over the past several decades. Now more than ever, athletes can be paid to do these activities full-time, encouraging more aspiring athletes to enter extreme sports. In addition, the addictive nature of these activities means that participants tend to stay in the sport for the thrill. While the increased popularity can result in more accidents, it can also make the sports safer as atheletes collectively learn from past mistakes.While people have undertaken extreme activities long before the advent of television and social media, these new platforms give extreme sports the much needed sponsorship and attention. Nowadays, outlandish and dangerous acts can be televised and monetized, giving the athletes a way to make a living out of these events. Therefore, more people would feel encouraged to participate in these activities knowing that they can have a decent income. On top of the external motivation, most extreme athletes take part in these sports because they are thrilling and addicting. These atheletes chase the rush and validation that they get when doing dangerous activities. As a result, even without the external rewards, some people would still partake in these sports.Given that people are motivated both internally and externally to participate in extreme sports, it is inevitable that these activities become more popular. While it is true that increased participation would result in more accidents, it would also create more lessons for future participants. In this way, these accidents and injuries would help educate future athletes on how to protect themselves. Moreoever, this increased popularity would also encourage governments to draft more safety regulations.In conclusion, given that it is human nature to want to achieve feats of strength and courage, extreme sports would always be attractive for some. Because of this, there will always be people injuring themselves while pursuing these feats. Therefore, these activities would become safer the more athletes learn from past incidents.;The world of extreme sports has witnessed a significant surge in popularity over the past few decades. Activities such as mountain climbing and hang-gliding have become increasingly appealing to thrill-seekers and adrenaline junkies. While this growing interest can lead to a higher number of accidents and injuries, it also has a paradoxical effect of making these sports safer. As more athletes participate in extreme sports, they collectively learn from past mistakes, which enables them to develop new safety protocols and best practices.The increased popularity of extreme sports can lead to a greater understanding of the risks involved and the implementation of safety measures to mitigate them. For instance, advancements in equipment technology and safety gear have been driven by the growing demand for extreme sports. Furthermore, the sharing of knowledge and experiences among athletes has facilitated a culture of safety and responsibility within these sports.It is inherent to human nature to strive for feats of strength and courage, which is a primary driving force behind the allure of extreme sports. The desire to push beyond perceived limits and achieve extraordinary accomplishments is a fundamental aspect of human psychology. As a result, extreme sports will always hold a certain attraction for individuals seeking to test their physical and mental boundaries. Despite the risks involved, the thrill and sense of accomplishment that come with extreme sports will continue to draw in new participants, contributing to the ongoing evolution and development of these activities. Ultimately, the growth of extreme sports is a testament to human ingenuity, resilience, and the unwavering pursuit of adventure.
1345;Many people support animal testing while others believe it isn’t appropriate (discuss);Many people support use of animals for testing medicines for humans. Others believe it isn’t appropriate to use animals for such experiments. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayApproval of the medicines for human use is a tedious process which involves a series of tests often performed on animals. While some people support this idea because it makes drugs safer for human consumption, others believe that it is an unethical practice. Personally, I am in favour of the idea that medicines should be tested in all possible scenarios before being released to the public.Those against animal experimentation argue that animals have the same rights as human beings because they are the outcome of the same evolution process through which humans came into existence. Infecting them with viruses and exposing them to bacteria, to create a conducive environment to test a chemical substance may cause excruciating pain to these lab animals. Any failed test can mean that the subject either loses its precious life or suffers for the rest of its existence, and understandably, some people are against what they consider an immoral practice.Nonetheless, if a drug is released into the market without a thorough end-to-end testing, it could cause severe damage to anyone who may consume it. Every day a large number of animals are being mercilessly killed by humans for their mere flesh and skin. There isn’t a big difference between killing an animal for food and sacrificing its life for testing a chemical composition, because both actions are helping the human race to survive. What’s more, the life of one animal used to test a life-saving drug could help many people live. This is why a large number of people believe that testing drugs on animals is a matter of survival.To sum up, there are valid reasons why animal testing seems cruel and unacceptable to some, and crucial to others. In my opinion, even though animals subjected to testing may suffer, it is a necessary step to ensure the healing power of a drug.;The debate over the use of animals for testing medicines intended for humans has sparked intense discussion. On one hand, many people support the use of animals in medical experiments, arguing that it is essential for advancing human health and saving countless lives. They claim that animal testing allows scientists to assess the safety and efficacy of new medicines before they are administered to humans, thereby minimizing the risk of adverse reactions. Moreover, animal testing has led to numerous breakthroughs in medical research, including the development of vaccines and treatments for diseases such as cancer and HIV.On the other hand, there are those who strongly oppose the use of animals in medical experiments, citing ethical concerns. They argue that animals have the right to be treated with respect and dignity, and that subjecting them to painful and often lethal experiments is morally wrong. Additionally, they claim that alternative methods, such as computer simulations and in vitro testing, can replace animal testing, thereby eliminating the need for animal suffering.In my opinion, while I understand the importance of animal testing in advancing medical research, I believe that it is not entirely justifiable. With the rapid advancement of technology, alternative methods are becoming increasingly sophisticated and effective. Furthermore, the use of animals in medical experiments raises serious ethical concerns, as animals are sentient beings that can feel pain and suffer. Therefore, I believe that we should strive to minimize the use of animals in medical experiments and invest in developing alternative methods that can replace animal testing altogether. Ultimately, it is our responsibility to ensure that scientific progress is achieved in a humane and ethical manner.
327;Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. Do you agree or disagree?;It is undeniable that nowadays, smart devices such as phones and tablets play an essential role in one's life. Through countless websites and applications, people can connect with each other without any boundaries. While many people agree that the introduction of these technologies has many disadvantages to the conservative way of starting and maintaining relationships, I personally believe that they rather develop new socializing methods.First and foremost, social medias and applications can help with keeping in touch with acquintances. Previously, people had to follow a precise time and location to meet up with their friends as they are unable to contact the others to reschedule. However, the internet allows them to update their plans at any time. This means that if there is any emergency, an individual can immediately postpone the upcoming event and find the next available slot to continue the plan. Furthermore, there are several applications that allow people to video call their friends and family who are currently living apart.The current technologies not only offer us options to communicate with our current contacts but also allow us to discover new friends. In the past, it is difficult to find people with a common interest which had to be done through social events. Nowadays, online communities enable their users to connect with new friends virtually. Thus, fewer individuals are left alone, especially introverts and those who are living in remote areas which can have difficulties socializing offline.All in all, despite the fact that there are many positive impacts of the invention of social medias and communication technologies, there are also risks and downsides of using them without face-to-face communication. Therefore, the time used for socializing online and offline should always be balanced.;The advent of social media and various applications has revolutionized the way we maintain relationships and expand our social circles. In today's digital age, one of the most significant benefits of these technologies is their ability to help us keep in touch with acquaintances who may be geographically distant. This is particularly important for individuals who have friends and family living in different parts of the world. Several applications now offer the option to video call, which has made it possible to visually connect with loved ones in real-time, regardless of the physical distance between them. This feature has been especially beneficial for people who are living apart due to work, education, or other reasons. It allows them to feel closer to their loved ones, share daily experiences, and celebrate special occasions together, despite the distance.Beyond maintaining existing relationships, current technologies also provide us with platforms to discover new friends and like-minded individuals. Social media platforms, as well as specialized interest-based applications, allow users to connect with others who share similar hobbies, interests, or passions. This has opened up new avenues for social interaction, enabling people to expand their social networks beyond their immediate geographical location. Whether it's through online communities centered around a particular hobby, social networking sites, or forums discussing specific topics, the opportunities to meet new people are vast and accessible.In conclusion, social media and applications have transformed the way we interact with others. They not only facilitate communication with our current contacts, ensuring we stay updated about their lives and share our experiences with them, but also offer us the chance to meet new individuals with similar interests. This has made the world feel more connected than ever, bridging distances and fostering global communities. As technology continues to evolve, it will be exciting to see how social media and applications further enhance our ability to form and maintain meaningful relationships.
837;Many people today, especially in the developed world, are choosing to have fewer children, or none at all.Why is this happening, and do you think it is a good trend?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Weather to have children or not is one of the most important questions young adults have to ask themselfs nowadays. Overpopulation is one of the many global problems next to climate change, and poverty.In my opinion, the need to have children roots back to us being nothing more, but civilised animals. Animals have one goal above all; reproduce. This is why in many cultures, men and women who cannot have chlidren are seen as disabled, or sick. Nowadays, modern values changed our perspective, having children is often seen as a necessity for a happy, and successful life.It is important to recognise the problems the developed world faces. There is smoke in the air, plastic pollution everywhere, poverty in third world countries, and many other factors that make Earth a terrible place for many. Above all, the life we give birth to will have to eat, drink, and consume just like everyone else, using more and more of the already limited resources, generating more and more trash.Many people argue that the above mentioned points are a pessimistic and unrealistic. Humans have to reproduce, to keep the species from extintion. And truthfully the only way to do that, is to give birth as many kids as possible. This issue lies deep in our society; here in Hungary, a family is rewared almost 30000 USD if they have 3 or more kids. This means that many people have children because they get money for it, and they are also seen socially accepted.I believe modern day intelligence goes further than IQ points and money earned. We have to recognise the problems created, overpopulation being one of them. While I do not believe that we should not have kids, I think there should be careful planning involved and self-reflection before giving birth to new life.";The world is grappling with numerous pressing global issues, including climate change, poverty, and overpopulation. Among these, overpopulation stands out as a particularly vexing problem, with far-reaching consequences for the environment, economy, and social structures. One of the underlying factors contributing to overpopulation is the incentive-driven approach some governments adopt, aiming to encourage larger family sizes. For instance, in certain regions, families are rewarded with substantial financial incentives, nearing $30,000, for having three or more children. This policy, while intended to boost population numbers, inadvertently exacerbates the overpopulation issue.The financial reward for having multiple children creates a perverse incentive, where some individuals choose to have more children primarily to receive the monetary benefit. This approach can lead to a situation where the decision to have children is influenced more by economic gain rather than personal or familial desires. Furthermore, societal norms often view larger families as a symbol of prosperity and happiness, adding a layer of social acceptance to the decision to have multiple children. This dual influence of financial gain and social approval can significantly contribute to the proliferation of large families, further straining already limited resources and exacerbating the issue of overpopulation.It is crucial for governments and policymakers to reassess these incentives and consider the long-term implications of such policies. Instead of solely focusing on numerical population growth, efforts should be directed towards sustainable development, education, and family planning. By doing so, it's possible to mitigate the adverse effects of overpopulation, such as increased competition for resources, environmental degradation, and strained social services. Ultimately, addressing overpopulation requires a multifaceted approach that balances economic, social, and environmental considerations to ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.
1317;Many people try to achieve a work-life balance but fail. Why is this happening? What can be done to help people overcome this problem?;Many people strive to achieve a work-life balance, but often find themselves failing despite their best efforts. This is not surprising, as balancing work and life commitments can be extremely difficult due to both having their unique stressors.One of the major reasons why so many people struggle to achieve harmony between their personal and professional lives is that now it is easier than ever for people to stay connected outside of regular work hours. This has led to an expectation that employees should always be available, and they risk being seen as unreliable or uncommitted if they are not. A knock-on effect of longer working hours is that little time is left for leisure activities such as socialising or engaging in hobbies or sports, which help reduce stress levels and improve overall well-being. This type of pressure and lack of free time can lead to feelings of burnout, with no respite from life’s pressures, resulting in chronic fatigue and diminished motivation over time.Helping those struggling to find a suitable work-life balance will require joint efforts of managers and employees. Workers, for instance, need to recognise the importance of taking regular breaks throughout the day and getting enough sleep each night, while employers should consider being more flexible when it comes to allowing staff to work remotely and offering paid vacation days. This will give employees space, both mentally and physically, enabling them to better manage their commitments without overextending themselves.In conclusion, achieving a successful work-life balance is something that many cannot quite reach due to external pressures from employers and a lack of downtime. However, these issues can be overcome, if we create realistic boundaries between our professional lives and personal goals, and make conscious decisions about how we want to spend our time.;The pursuit of a work-life balance is a goal that many individuals strive to achieve, yet often find themselves falling short despite their best efforts. Balancing work and life commitments can be an extremely challenging task, as both aspects of life have their unique stressors that can be overwhelming at times. On one hand, work commitments can be a significant source of stress, as the pressure to meet deadlines, manage workload, and navigate office politics can take a toll on one's mental and physical health. The demands of a job can be all-consuming, making it difficult for individuals to disconnect from work-related tasks and responsibilities.On the other hand, life commitments, such as family and personal responsibilities, can also be a significant source of stress. Managing household chores, caring for dependents, and maintaining relationships can be time-consuming and emotionally draining. The pressure to fulfill these responsibilities can be just as overwhelming as work-related stressors, making it difficult for individuals to find a balance between their work and personal life. Furthermore, the boundaries between work and life are often blurred, making it challenging for individuals to fully disconnect from one aspect of their life and focus on the other.As a result, many people find themselves struggling to achieve a work-life balance, leading to burnout, decreased productivity, and decreased overall well-being. It is essential for individuals to recognize the challenges of balancing work and life commitments and to develop strategies to manage stress and prioritize their well-being. By acknowledging the unique stressors of both work and life, individuals can take steps to mitigate their impact and cultivate a healthier balance between their professional and personal lives. Ultimately, achieving a work-life balance requires effort, intention, and a willingness to make adjustments to prioritize one's overall well-being.
1298;Many schoolchildren today take part in work experience sessions for short periods of time instead of attending school. Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It has been a popular trend for some time now to put children into what can be called ‘work experience placements’. The children are taken out of school and take part in various types of work, usually for around a week. Some people criticise this trend, but I can’t see how it can be a negative experience.One of the criticisms is that children lose a week of schoolwork. With the pressure to do well at school increasing, children need every bit of help to maximise their potential. Taking them out of the school, it is therefore argued, stops them from getting access to needed education for a whole week. As the students won’t really be of much help to a workplace for just one week, it would therefore be better for them to remain at school.While this is a valid point, taking a child’s entire experience of school into account, a single week away does not make a significant difference. Indeed, if the timing of the week’s work placements is done correctly, the week can also serve as a kind of ‘holiday’ away from school, something that is regularly needed in order to allow students to remain fresh and enthusiastic. In many work placements, children also get to see some of things they learn at school put into a realistic context, allowing them to understand the relevance of what they learn and thereby creating a way to reinforce the learning.In addition to this, schoolchildren can be quite nervous about the world of work that they will have to join at some point in their lives. By getting this short taste of what it is like, they can see that it is nothing to be scared about. As well as this, children will often have some ideas of what they want to do for a living, but are not sure. By allowing them to see a type of work they are considering, they are better able to decide whether that career could be suitable for them.I feel, therefore, that work placements can be seen as a positive development. Missing a short amount of school is not serious and the benefits that can be gained from the placements are significant.;The trend of taking children out of school for a week has sparked intense debate, with some people criticizing the practice. However, they argue that it can have a detrimental impact on a child's education. Nevertheless, I strongly disagree with this perspective. In my opinion, a single week away from school does not make a significant difference to a child's education.Firstly, the school curriculum is designed to be flexible, and a week's absence is unlikely to hinder a child's overall academic progress. The majority of schools provide ample support and resources for children to catch up on any missed work, making it easy for them to get back on track. Moreover, a week's break can actually be beneficial for a child's mental and emotional well-being, allowing them to recharge and return to school refreshed and focused.Furthermore, a family vacation or trip can be a valuable learning experience in itself. Children can learn about different cultures, histories, and environments, broadening their knowledge and understanding of the world. These experiences can be just as valuable as those gained in a traditional classroom setting. Additionally, spending quality time with family and loved ones can strengthen relationships and create lasting memories, which are essential for a child's emotional and social development.In conclusion, I firmly believe that taking children out of school for a week is not a negative experience. On the contrary, it can be a positive and enriching experience that can complement their education. Rather than criticizing this trend, we should be embracing it as an opportunity for children to grow, learn, and develop in new and exciting ways. By doing so, we can provide children with a more holistic and well-rounded education that prepares them for success in all aspects of life.
1413;Millions of people every year move to English- speaking countries such as Australia, Britain or America, in order to study at school, college or university. Why do so many people want to study in English? Why is English such an important international language?;Nowadays, language becomes a major factor to . Many people prefer to study abroad English-speaking country because English is an international language. There is no doubt that the best way to improve the English language skill is to use the English language daily so if people study in English speaking countries, their will be improved automatically and it will give them some advantages such as work in many countries or they will be to many different places without studying other languages. This essay will describe in detail why English is an important international language.Firstly, the English language is widely used in many countries and at present, the world traders are currently developing rapidly. In order to compete with people from different countries, it is to be able to communicate the English language. For example, China has been improving a lot in many sectors. They are able to compete with other countries because many people in China English language and they are trying hard to study English.Secondly, many companies prefer to employ people who can speak English because if the companies create new in different countries, the employers are able to move the new branch without new people and the branch company is still able to communicate with the central company. In fact, one of the largest companies in the world (Google) has created some in different countries and each of the Google is able to discuss things or otherwise communicate even though they are in different countries because they all use English to communicate.In conclusion, many people move to English speaking countries for further studies because they believe that it will improve their English skills and in order to become a successful person in the future, mastering English is .;The preference for studying abroad in an English-speaking country has become a significant trend among students worldwide. One of the primary reasons for this phenomenon is that English has become the international language, which serves as a global means of communication. As a result, many individuals seek to immerse themselves in an English-speaking environment to enhance their language skills and broaden their career opportunities.In today's globalized economy, companies often expand their operations to different countries, making English language proficiency a highly valued asset. Many multinational companies prefer to employ individuals who can communicate effectively in English, as it enables them to coordinate with the central company and facilitate international business transactions. This is particularly crucial for companies with subsidiaries or branches in various countries, as English serves as a common language for communication among employees and management from diverse linguistic backgrounds.The ability to speak English has become a key criterion for employment in many industries, especially in international business, finance, and trade. By studying in an English-speaking country, students can acquire a competitive edge in the job market, as they gain hands-on experience with the language and develop a deeper understanding of the cultural context in which it is used. Furthermore, this experience also enhances their chances of securing employment with multinational companies or pursuing careers that involve international communication.In conclusion, the desire to study abroad in an English-speaking country is driven by the recognition of English as a global language and its significance in the international job market. As companies continue to expand globally, the demand for English language proficiency will only continue to grow, making the acquisition of this skill an essential component of career advancement in today's interconnected world.
795;Missions to explore space are hugely expensive, and there are problems on Earth which demand attention. The number of these missions needs to be reduced.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is supposed by many, that high-cost space studies should be cut off while more focus should be paid to the challenges mankind face on Earth. This essay completely disargees with such view because of two reasons that will de developed further.The first reason is that only rich countries spend thier budgets for space studies. This means that only when states have resolved most of their problems with poverty, level of medicine treatment, safety, they can divert some of the funds to invest in future technologies. Moreover, citizens will go on a strike and make the govenment to deal with real life problems instead of dreaming about the space. For example, not more than 5% of USA GDP is spent on space programs that is sufficient to progress, construct new sputniks, and send astronauts to the Internations Space Station.The second argument supposes that many space technologies have a dual puropose. In other words, being initially developed for studing the space, they were adopted to make people's day-to-day life easier. For example, mobile phones and the mobile Internet, navigaion using GPS would not be possibe if people were not trying to explore space.In conclusion, new technologies are developed when people are trying to learn the world outside our planet. This;The notion that space studies should be a priority for all countries, regardless of their economic situation, is a misguided view. This essay completely disagrees with such a perspective for two compelling reasons. Firstly, it is only rich countries that have the luxury of allocating their budgets to space studies. This is because these nations have already addressed the fundamental problems plaguing their societies, such as poverty, the level of medicine and treatment, and safety concerns.In other words, when a country has successfully mitigated the pressing issues of poverty, ensured a high standard of medical care, and established a safe environment for its citizens, it can then consider diverting some of its funds to invest in futuristic technologies like space exploration. This is a logical progression, as it would be imprudent for a country still grappling with basic human needs to expend resources on what might be perceived as a luxury. The reality is that space studies require significant financial investment, and only countries with a strong economic foundation can afford such expenditures without compromising the welfare of their citizens.This rationale underscores the disparity in priorities between economically developed and developing countries. While the former can indulge in the pursuit of space studies for the advancement of human knowledge and potential future benefits, the latter must prioritize solving their immediate socio-economic challenges. Therefore, the idea that all countries should prioritize space studies overlooks the stark economic realities and the hierarchy of needs that nations must address to ensure the well-being and development of their populations.
1434;Modern medicine helps to live a longer life. Do you agree?;"The modern medicine is very important for living a long life. It on new technology. . Also modern medicine is human body. . Therefore I agree that the modern medicine to live longer.First of all, the modern medicine can prevent incurable diseases. Doctors can find some diseases very early. Then doctors can give suitable medicines to patients. New modern doctors . Also intelligent people in the world live a long life modern medicine. That is very important in the human society because their creative things are coming with them and they can help others for a longer time when they are living ., old population is increasing in the country. It is country’s economy and third world countries. But old people are very important in human society because their experience definitely helps to . ‘Experience is better than qualifications’ However, old people are living a long life; it is helping others to live a long life because we can get advice from them and they are covering our culture and society.Moreover, modern medicine is being addictive for some people, so that they cannot live without medicine. They should take medicine all their lives. Also modern medicine is very expensive. Therefore most of poor countries modern medicine and it has taken a commercial shape, also it is depending on money. In the modern medicine human kindness. People who have money can take modern medicine. But indigenous medicine has well human friendly shape.

So doctors can take immediately. Therefore, hesitate to agree with the above mentioned statement.Your essay has several confusing sentences, where your meaning is unclear.You mix advantages and disadvantages of the modern medicine in one paragraph when you should divide them – have advantages in one paragraph and disadvantages in another.If you agree with the statement, you should have 2 paragraphs supporting your opinion and one supporting the opposite opinion, in your essay it is 2 against and 1 for.";The advent of modern medicine has revolutionized the way we approach healthcare, and its significance in living a long and healthy life cannot be overstated. Modern medicine relies heavily on new technology, which has enabled medical professionals to diagnose and treat diseases more effectively. One of the most notable advantages of modern medicine is its ability to prevent incurable diseases. With the help of advanced diagnostic tools and techniques, doctors can now identify diseases at a very early stage, allowing for timely intervention and treatment.Early detection of diseases enables doctors to prescribe suitable medicines to patients, increasing their chances of recovery and improving their overall quality of life. The impact of modern medicine is particularly evident in the increasing lifespan of individuals, especially among intelligent and educated populations. Studies have shown that intelligent people tend to live longer, and this can be attributed to their greater awareness and adoption of modern medical practices. They are more likely to follow healthy lifestyles, seek regular medical check-ups, and adhere to prescribed treatments, all of which contribute to a longer and healthier life.The benefits of modern medicine are also reflected in the growing population of older adults. As medical technology continues to advance, more people are living into their 70s, 80s, and beyond, with many remaining active and healthy well into old age. This increase in the older population is a testament to the effectiveness of modern medicine in preventing and managing diseases, and in improving overall health outcomes. In conclusion, modern medicine plays a vital role in extending human lifespan and improving the quality of life. Its emphasis on early detection, prevention, and treatment of diseases has made a significant impact on public health, and its continued advancement holds great promise for the future of healthcare.
1315;More and more people today are drinking sugar-based drinks. Why is this happening? What measures can be taken to reverse this trend?;An alarming number of people today consume sugar-based drinks, whether it is in the form of soda, energy drinks or fruit drinks. Often consumers are lured by their widespread availability and convenience, however, marketing campaigns also play a role, targeting young people and giving them the perception that sugary drinks are not as unhealthy as they actually are.The availability of these types of drinks has greatly increased over time. They can now be found in almost any store or restaurant, which makes them easily accessible to almost anyone. The fact that they are often cheaper than alternatives, such as water or freshly squeezed juice, makes them an especially attractive option for those on a budget. Marketing campaigns for sugary beverages have been quite successful in creating positive associations attached to these products through advertisements on TV and billboards. This encourages people to consider them fun rather than unhealthy and normalises them within society.Luckily, reversing the rise in popularity of sugary drinks is still possible, if we act now and attack the problem from different angles. One of the very first steps should be educating people on the health risks associated with high sugar intake so that they can make better-informed decisions when selecting what type of beverage they consume. Companies should also be held accountable by law for their misleading marketing campaigns aimed at children and teenagers who are more likely to believe the false claims about their products’ health benefits without fully understanding what’s being sold to them. Schools, colleges and universities, and any institutions catering for young people, should consider banning sugary drinks and replacing them with refreshing alternatives without added sugar.Overall, it is important that we recognise the potential health risks posed by consuming too much sugar from soft drinks and take actionable steps towards reversing this trend in order to ensure our long-term wellbeing. Through greater education, government regulation, and increased corporate responsibility we can ensure that more people understand why reducing their intake of sugary beverages is important while still allowing them to access enjoyable yet healthier options.;The marketing campaigns for sugary drinks have been incredibly effective in shaping public perception, and unfortunately, this has contributed to the widespread normalization of these unhealthy beverages within our society. By creating positive associations and emotions tied to sugary drinks, such as fun, socializing, or celebrations, these campaigns have led people to view them as enjoyable and harmless, rather than as unhealthy options. As a result, sugary drinks have become an integral part of our daily lives, often consumed without a second thought about their detrimental effects on our health.However, it is not too late to reverse this trend. If we act now and adopt a multi-faceted approach, we can still mitigate the rise in popularity of sugar-based drinks. This requires a concerted effort from various stakeholders, including governments, healthcare professionals, and the beverage industry itself. Governments can play a crucial role by implementing policies such as taxation on sugary drinks, stricter labeling requirements, and public education campaigns highlighting the risks associated with excessive sugar consumption. Additionally, schools and community programs can promote healthy alternatives and encourage lifestyle changes that prioritize nutritious beverages.The beverage industry also has a significant role to play in this effort. By reformulating their products to reduce sugar content and introducing healthier options, companies can contribute to a shift in consumer preferences. Moreover, influencers and social media platforms can help reshape cultural attitudes towards sugary drinks, promoting a norm where water, low-sugar drinks, and natural juices are the preferred choices. Ultimately, reversing the popularity of sugary drinks demands a collective effort and a commitment to prioritizing public health over commercial interests. With immediate and sustained action, we can normalize healthier drinking habits and pave the way for a society where sugary drinks are no longer the default choice.
1259;More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Over the past decades, it has been registered a considerable decrease in the percentage of people eager to create a family at a young age. There could be different reasons for this and I am going to state them clearly in the following paragraphs, which will also explain why I believe the advantages of this situation far outweigh the disadvantages.Apparently, the society we currently live in has undergone substantial changes over the years, sometimes without us even noticing it. The most evident of these variations has probably been the gradual rise in the number of old people as opposed to the dramatic fall in the number of births. In fact, owing to the decline of the economy of most nations and the subsequent reduction of work opportunities, more and more people are giving up on the idea of becoming parents in their 20s or 30s. Many people see this as a negative aspect for our society; however, I have to strongly disagree with their opinion.The drawbacks to which a lot of people point out when discussing about these kind of topics often has to do with the age gap between parents and their children. Admittedly, someone cannot decide to have a child in their 40s without considering the significant generation gap that would separate them from their kids and, as a result, the issues of miscommunication that could arise.However, the disadvantages become of secondary importance as soon as the much more remarkable benefits are examined. First of all, older parents also means more responsible and mature caretakers; consequently, due to their broader life experience, they would arguably make better advisors for their kids. Not to mention that older parents would not only have more stable and secure jobs, but they would also have more consistent savings to devote to their children's further education, which in turn could help the latter having a better and well-paid job in the future.To conclude, although it's impossible not to take into account the drawbacks of having a child at a more advanced age, the advantages still outrun the disadvantages. Thus, children would be the first to benefit from such a situation.";The notion that the decline of the economy is leading to a delay in parenthood has sparked a heated debate. Many individuals view this trend as a negative aspect of our society, arguing that it will have far-reaching and devastating consequences. However, I strongly disagree with this opinion. In my opinion, the shift towards older parenthood is a positive development that will ultimately benefit our society.One of the primary advantages of older parents is that they are more likely to be responsible and mature caretakers. By delaying parenthood until their 30s or 40s, individuals have had time to establish their careers, achieve financial stability, and develop emotional maturity. This, in turn, enables them to provide a more stable and secure environment for their children. Older parents are also more likely to have a stronger sense of self-awareness, allowing them to make more informed decisions about their children's upbringing and well-being.Furthermore, older parents are often more financially secure, which means they are better equipped to provide for their children's needs. They are also more likely to have a stronger support network, comprising of friends, family, and community, which can be a valuable resource for both the parents and the children. Additionally, older parents are often more patient, wise, and experienced, which enables them to offer guidance and mentorship to their children as they navigate the challenges of growing up.In conclusion, while some may view the trend of older parenthood as a negative aspect of our society, I firmly believe that it has numerous benefits. Older parents are more responsible, mature, and financially secure, making them better equipped to provide for their children's needs. As our society continues to evolve, it is essential that we recognize and celebrate the advantages of older parenthood, rather than viewing it as a negative trend.
1425;Most high level positions in companies are filled by men, even though the workforce in many developed countries consists of 50 percent female workers. Companies should be required to allocate a certain percentage of management positions to women. Discuss, what is your opinion?;"The inequality between men and women has always been a significant issue in society. , it is undeniable that most vital positions in companies are taken by males, not females. Therefore, that companies should allocate to women a certain number of these positions. However, I do not agree with this requirement completely.In some feudal countries, it was true to say that the society the males, and at that time instances of inequality occurred very frequently. Up until the present moment, it in some developing countries; also it is greatly . A large number of women in these countries are not allowed to go to work or even go to . In this case, this is not an individual issue, but social problem. The governments should have some solution to this tendency, and at the same time they should promulgate a new legislation to protect women’s .On the other hand, the global economy is developing rapidly nowadays. In most corporations, distinguish men from women; they only focus on working efficiently. In this world, any employees who possess enough abilities and work in an effective way, be promoted to positions. Therefore, allocating the high level positions in companies to women is not necessary. Moreover, the instances of women in essential positions . Those women are very successful in their work and their lives.In conclusion, although the inequality between men and women has reduced, it still is a social issue worth . Personally, in my opinion we should create as many opportunities for women to have an equal life as we can.";The inequality between men and women has always been a significant issue in society, with women often being underrepresented in positions of power and influence. It is a stark reality that most vital positions in companies are taken by males, not females, perpetuating a cycle of gender disparity. To address this issue, some advocate for companies to allocate a certain number of these positions to women, a policy often referred to as quotas. While the intention behind such a requirement is commendable, aiming to promote gender equality and provide women with opportunities they are often denied, I do not agree with this requirement completely.On one hand, allocating specific positions to women could potentially accelerate the process of achieving gender balance in the workplace, particularly in industries and roles where women are severely underrepresented. It could also send a powerful message about the importance of diversity and inclusion, potentially inspiring more women to pursue careers in these fields. Moreover, it acknowledges the historical and systemic barriers that have prevented women from ascending to these positions, which is a crucial step in rectifying past injustices.On the other hand, I believe that such a requirement could have unintended consequences. For instance, it might lead to the perception that women are only in these positions because of the quota system, rather than based on their merit and qualifications. This could undermine the achievements of women who have earned their positions through hard work and talent, and might lead to resentment among male colleagues who feel that the system is unfair. Furthermore, a more effective approach might be to address the underlying issues that prevent women from rising through the ranks, such as lack of mentorship, biased promotion practices, and inadequate family leave policies, rather than just treating the symptoms with quotas.In conclusion, while the idea of allocating certain positions to women to combat inequality has its merits, it is not a solution without its drawbacks. A more nuanced approach that focuses on creating a fair and inclusive work environment, where promotions are based on merit regardless of gender, seems more likely to achieve lasting change and true equality. This might involve implementing blind hiring practices, providing training on unconscious bias, and ensuring that the workplace is supportive of all employees, regardless of gender. By addressing the root causes of inequality and fostering a culture of inclusivity and fairness, we can work towards a future where women and men have equal opportunities to succeed, without the need for quotas.
1390;News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in a newspaper. What factors do you think influence their decisions? Do we become used to bad news? Would it be better if more good news was reported?;. There are two factors that influence their decisions. The first is the kind of customers they aim at. each kind of readers and watchers has its own features. For example, if your customers are almost entirely teenagers, you have to concentrate on something attracting them such as stories, photographs of singer stars, film stars, funny tales, and fashion. It be very silly if you to provide teenagers with economic or news. On the contrary, and politicians may never read news about James Blunt or Keira Knightley. Therefore, what influences news editors’ decisions the most is the taste of their customers.The second factor is how hot and attractive the news is. Who or watch news from a year or a month ago or even about something that happened last week? The answer is . In the energetic and competitive world nowadays, people always ask for a really news. So that to satisfy customers, there is a pressure on all editors to find continually what has already happened not only yesterday but even an hour ago. Or else, they may lose their customers. None of editors wants that bleak future.The type of news is also an important consideration. Whether on television or in newspapers, we seem to get more of and become used to bad news. It is harder for us to come across a piece of good news. We can’t deny that bad things happen on Earth day by day. However, news editors try to gain more and more , which means more and more money, using bad news as a magnet. bad news makes us curious. We want to know why it is bad, what it is about, whether it influences us or not. As a result, we will buy newspapers or watch television to find out. And the happiest people are, of course, news editors.In my view it would be better if more good news reported. Bad news makes us good news makes us happy. There should an an equal amount of good and bad news. In that way we can give something bad a lot of thought while still being happy about the good news. Any inequalities between good news and bad news should be avoided. Nowadays we cannot live without news, and for that reason the role of news editors became very important. We should support them, and in turn they should try their best to provide us with useful news, both good and bad.;The media plays a significant role in shaping our perception of the world. News editors, in their pursuit of higher ratings and profits, often prioritize sensational and bad news over positive and uplifting stories. In my opinion, this approach is misguided and has negative consequences. By focusing on bad news, editors aim to captivate audiences and attract more viewers, thereby increasing their revenue. However, this strategy comes at a cost.Bad news has a peculiar allure, as it piques our curiosity and encourages us to learn more about the circumstances surrounding the event. We want to understand the reasons behind the negativity, the details of the story, and the potential impact it may have on our lives. This natural human instinct to seek information and stay informed can lead to an overexposure to negative news, which can have a profound effect on our mental and emotional well-being.In contrast, reporting more good news would have a profoundly positive impact on society. By highlighting stories of kindness, generosity, and achievement, the media can inspire and uplift audiences, promoting a sense of hope and optimism. Good news can also foster a sense of community and social connection, as people come together to celebrate and appreciate the positive aspects of life. Furthermore, a balanced media landscape that prioritizes good news can help to create a more informed and empathetic public, one that is better equipped to address the challenges we face and build a more compassionate and equitable world. Ultimately, I firmly believe that a shift towards reporting more good news would be a welcome change, one that would have far-reaching benefits for individuals and society as a whole.
1321;Newspapers have a significant influence on people’s ideas and opinions. Why is this happening? Is it a positive or negative situation?;Many people believe that newspapers play a pivotal role in shaping the way we think. There are numerous ways in which this affects our society, and I believe that this influence is mostly negative.Newspapers have long been a source of valuable information that has kept societies abreast of the latest happenings in the world. Since the average citizen has minimal knowledge about the information in expert analysis articles, well-established newspapers are powerfully poised to form public opinion through attention-grabbing images and carefully worded commentary. This leaves the reader no choice but to trust the accuracy of what they have read.Sadly, unbiased objectivity, which used to be the core idea behind journalism, seems to be a thing of the past. The arrival and spread of social media platforms has caused a gradual decline in print media subscriptions and their circulation, since readers tend to favor the internet and social media to stay informed about current affairs. This gave rise to a worrying trend of newspapers using sensationalist and controversial tactics to improve their sales. As a result, the constant barrage of bad news has led to a society that sees itself as more vulnerable and powerless than ever. To make matters worse, there are plenty of well-documented instances where newspapers have been used to spread false propaganda which is usually politically motivated.All in all, although newspapers are our lifeline to the world around us, the recent trend of publishing misinformation has had a mostly negative impact on readers. It is my hope that newspapers will go back to publishing impartial accounts of the latest news in the future.;The advent of newspapers revolutionized the way societies consumed information, providing a platform for the dissemination of news and current events. For centuries, newspapers have been a trusted source of valuable information, keeping the public informed about the latest happenings in the world. The core idea behind journalism was built on the principles of unbiased objectivity, where reporters strived to present facts without taking a stance or promoting a particular agenda. However, this notion seems to be a thing of the past.In recent years, the lines between objective reporting and biased journalism have become increasingly blurred. Many newspapers have abandoned their commitment to impartiality, instead adopting a partisan approach that caters to specific interests and ideologies. This shift has led to a proliferation of sensationalized and misleading headlines, which often prioritize clickbait over fact-based reporting. As a result, the public is left to navigate a complex and often confusing media landscape, where it is difficult to discern fact from fiction.The erosion of unbiased objectivity in journalism has significant implications for society. When newspapers prioritize ideology over fact-based reporting, they contribute to the polarization of public discourse and the erosion of trust in institutions. Furthermore, the lack of objective reporting undermines the ability of citizens to make informed decisions, as they are no longer presented with a balanced and accurate representation of the facts. Ultimately, the decline of unbiased objectivity in journalism threatens the very foundations of a well-informed and engaged citizenry, which is essential for the functioning of a healthy democracy. It is imperative that newspapers reclaim their commitment to objective reporting, prioritizing fact-based journalism over partisan interests, in order to restore trust and credibility in the media.
1391;Nowadays environmental problems are too big to be managed by individual persons or individual countries. In other words, it is an international problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;An essential problem of the 21st century is world pollution. Currently the environment is so contaminated that urgent measures should be taken. A single individual cannot be blamed for the world pollution, however every person should take care of his or her habitat. In addition, it is vital that environmental issues are treated internationally.Lately, many presentations, conferences and international summits are held to deal with waste treatment, recycling, and soil and water contamination. joint efforts and consolidation can only help in the mutual war the ongoing environmental disaster. For instance, governments should offer support to companies and organizations, involved in manufacturing, industry or agriculture in order to find environment-friendly approaches. These could be special law regulations, recycling programs, helping courses in order to implement ISO certificates and many more.However, the influence of individuals over environment should not be ignored. If we do not that our planet is our home, we will never be able to take care of it. We have to contribute every day to the preservation of nature and environment. For example, always remember to save energy by switching off lamps, computers and everything that we do not use. Our next obligation is to separate waste and throw bulk only in the designated areas. Driving vehicles can also be environment friendly. For example, we have to avoid accelerating the engines too rapidly or using the air conditioning in the country, where it would be better to save energy and simply open the windows.To sum up, environmental problems should be handled by local and international authorities as well as individuals. Every single person should take care of the environment, moreover we have to bring up our children to be conscious citizens of a clean and preserved planet.;The 21st century is plagued by a multitude of problems, but one of the most pressing issues is world pollution. The devastating impact of pollution on our planet is a cumulative effect of human activities, and it is unrealistic to pinpoint a single individual as the culprit. However, this does not absolve us of our responsibility to take care of our surroundings. Every person has a vital role to play in mitigating the effects of pollution and preserving the health of our planet.The sheer scale of pollution is overwhelming, with plastic waste, toxic chemicals, and greenhouse gas emissions threatening the very foundations of our ecosystem. It is easy to feel powerless in the face of such a massive problem, but the truth is that collective action can lead to significant positive change. By making conscious choices in our daily lives, such as reducing our use of single-use plastics, conserving water, and using public transport, we can all contribute to a cleaner and healthier environment.Moreover, taking care of our immediate habitat is not only a moral obligation, but also a matter of self-interest. A clean and well-maintained living space is essential for our physical and mental well-being. By adopting simple habits such as recycling, composting, and properly disposing of waste, we can create a ripple effect that inspires others to do the same. Furthermore, supporting organizations and initiatives that work towards environmental conservation and sustainability can also have a profound impact.In conclusion, while it is impossible to blame a single individual for the world's pollution problems, it is essential that every person takes responsibility for their own actions and their impact on the environment. By working together and making a collective effort to reduce our ecological footprint, we can create a better future for ourselves and for generations to come. It is our duty to take care of our planet, and every small action counts in the fight against pollution.
1368;Nowadays families move to different countries for work and some think it has a negative effect on children (agree/disagree);Nowadays families move to different countries for work. Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Recent advancements, in technology and transportation in particular, are reshaping our world in an unprecedented manner. Nowadays, it is not unusual for people to work abroad. Most expatriates relocate their families to the countries . Some people argue that this phenomenon negatively affects children, however, I agree with those who believe the opposite is true.Those who think that relocating children to a new place is undesirable do so for many reasons. Their most common argument is the negative impact of moving on a child’s personality. There is no doubt that living in a different community comes with its challenges, especially to young people, as they get exposed to behaviours, actions and customs they might not be familiar with. As a result, children could possibly feel a lack of stability and some confusion. It is also likely that their patriotic feelings and sense of belonging to their home country could weaken as they would miss many opportunities to celebrate their national events.Nevertheless, I firmly believe that opinion to be ludicrous, as it seems that getting exposed to a new culture is beneficial in many ways. It fosters young social and emotional capabilities. Moreover, children living abroad have better opportunities to and practice new languages. Mastering more than one language improves not only their intellectual development, but also their opportunities in acquiring better jobs in the future. According to a recent study published by the University of Chicago, competency in more than one language increases employment chances on average by 200%.In conclusion, I strongly believe that living in a different country positively affects children in all aspects. Acquiring new languages, and an open minded and tolerant personality are just few examples of the many possible benefits.This essay presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt. The writer’s ideas are relevant and well‐supported. The arrangement of information and use of cohesive devices are fine, perhaps with a slight overuse in the second body paragraph. Sentence structures are complex, and the vocabulary is varied and appropriately used, except for some minor grammatical/spelling mistakes. This essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;The phenomenon of expatriates relocating their families to the countries they work in has become increasingly common. While some argue that this has a negative impact on children, I firmly believe that the opposite is true. Living in a different country can have a profoundly positive effect on a child's social and emotional development.As children adapt to a new culture and environment, they develop essential life skills such as resilience, adaptability, and open-mindedness. They learn to navigate unfamiliar social situations, make new friends, and communicate with people from diverse backgrounds. These experiences foster young social and emotional capabilities, enabling them to become more confident, independent, and empathetic individuals.Moreover, acquiring new languages is a significant benefit of living abroad. Not only does it broaden their cultural understanding, but it also significantly improves their employment chances. On average, being proficient in multiple languages can increase employment opportunities by  to 200%. This is because multinational companies and international organizations highly value language skills, making bilingual or multilingual individuals more competitive in the job market.In conclusion, relocating to a new country can be a life-enriching experience for children. Rather than being detrimental, it provides them with a unique opportunity to develop valuable social and emotional skills, as well as acquire new languages. As they grow and mature, these skills will serve them well, opening doors to new experiences, relationships, and career opportunities. Therefore, I strongly agree that living in a different country can have a profoundly positive impact on a child's development, setting them up for success in an increasingly globalized world.
1316;Nowadays many teenagers have a celebrity who they follow as a role model. Some people think this is not a good idea, because celebrities often set a bad example. Do you agree or disagree?;It is not uncommon for teenagers to worship celebrities. From singers to actors, many young people around the world look up to these stars and attempt to emulate their lifestyles. In my opinion, allowing children to idolize celebrities can often be detrimental, as they frequently set a poor example.Many of today’s celebrities tend to lack moral values, and they promote behaviour inappropriate for young people. For instance, some music videos feature explicit lyrics glorifying drug use and violence. In addition, the media often reports on celebrities who indulge in excessive partying or drinking alcohol despite being underage. These types of headlines can have a negative influence on impressionable teens who might falsely believe that they should follow suit to appear cool or successful.Poor morals aren’t the only issue, as many popular stars are also well-known for their irresponsible spending habits. They routinely splurge on luxury items such as designer clothing or expensive cars without any consideration for budgeting or saving money responsibly. This kind of behaviour is dangerous because it is normalizing materialism and teaching teens that costly possessions will bring them happiness instead of focusing on what really matters in life: meaningful relationships, knowledge, and hard work.To conclude, young adults should keep in mind that society’s perception of fame and fortune is based on temporary, insubstantial things rather than what actually matters. In the grand scheme of things, it would be far more beneficial for teenagers to spend time developing their own set of values rooted in quality education and strong family relationships.;The Influence of Celebrities on Young People: A Concerning TrendCelebrities have long been idolized by young people, but a growing concern is that they often lack the moral values that are essential for positive role models. Many music videos, for instance, feature explicit lyrics that glorify drug use and violence, which can have a detrimental impact on impressionable young minds. These explicit content can desensitize children to the harm caused by such behaviors, promoting a culture of recklessness and lawlessness.Moreover, celebrities are often criticized for their irresponsible spending habits, flaunting their wealth and material possessions on social media. This can create unrealistic expectations among young people, encouraging them to prioritize materialism over values such as hard work, education, and personal growth. The lavish lifestyles of celebrities can also promote a sense of entitlement, which can be particularly damaging to young people who may feel pressured to keep up with the latest trends and fashions.The promotion of inappropriate behavior by celebrities can have serious consequences, including increased drug use, violence, and other forms of antisocial behavior among young people. Furthermore, the glorification of wealth and materialism can lead to a lack of empathy and social responsibility, which are essential values for creating a compassionate and equitable society. It is essential, therefore, for parents, educators, and other influential figures to promote positive role models and encourage young people to critically evaluate the messages and behaviors promoted by celebrities. By doing so, we can help to create a more positive and responsible culture that values the well-being and character development of young people. Ultimately, it is crucial that we hold celebrities to higher moral standards, recognizing the significant influence they have on shaping the values and behaviors of future generations.
1359;Nowadays more and more people want to live by themselves, why is this happening?;Nowadays more and more people want to live by themselves. What are the reasons? Is it a positive or negative trend?These days a vast majority of people want to lead an independent life. The fundamental reason lies in people’s educational qualifications that fuel their craving for freedom in life. This can be seen as a positive trend because living alone is likely to nurture a mature mindset at early stages of one’s life.Many people are well educated to stand up on their own. Tertiary education broadens their horizons, and they wish to experience freedom of life. With a very good educational background it becomes easier to find a well-paid job, and with lucrative income they gain confidence to lead an independent life, thereby achieving their goals. For example, engineering graduates can find a job in another town and their salary is enough for them to move and settle down there. This enables them to move away from their family and live on their own.Living alone helps one to develop maturity, which can be seen as a positive impact on individuals and the society as a whole. Being independent means young people have to face life challenges alone and going through this process improves their resilience. They become more responsible, as they have to take care of themselves and develop budgeting skills and saving habits, for their future needs as well. Better planning of their finances nurtures the custom of wise spending at early stages of adult life.In conclusion, the reason why many people wish to live independently these days is because their education level gives them both the awareness of freedom in life and means of achieving it. Since living alone promotes one’s maturity, it seems to be a positive trend in today’s society.This response covers the task requirements by addressing the two parts of the question, why people choose to live alone and whether this is a positive trend. The ideas are clearly explained and supported, the information is organised in paragraphs in an easy to follow way, and the level of coherence is adequate. A range of complex sentence forms is used and there are no grammatical errors. Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.;The phenomenon of people choosing to live alone has become increasingly prevalent in modern society. There are several reasons why individuals opt for solo living arrangements. Firstly, living alone provides a sense of independence and freedom, allowing people to make their own choices and decisions without having to consider others. This autonomy is particularly appealing to young adults who value their independence and want to make the most of their solo years. Additionally, living alone enables people to maintain their own schedules and routines, which is beneficial for those with non-traditional work hours or who require a lot of time for personal pursuits.Another significant factor contributing to the rise of solo living is the improvement in economic conditions. As people's financial situations improve, they are more likely to be able to afford living alone, which was previously a luxury only the wealthy could afford. This trend is particularly noticeable in urban areas where the cost of living is higher, and people are more likely to prioritize their personal space. The question remains, however, as to whether this is a positive trend. On the one hand, living alone can have negative consequences such as increased loneliness and isolation. On the other hand, it can be incredibly empowering, allowing individuals to focus on personal growth and development. Moreover, solo living arrangements can also lead to a reduction in conflicts and stress that often arise from shared living situations. Overall, while there are valid arguments on both sides, it can be argued that the trend of people choosing to live alone is a positive one, as it reflects a societal shift towards valuing individuality and personal freedom.

Children and young adults alike can be seen playing the game whenever they have a spare moment, highlighting the significant role it plays in their daily lives. This trend is not limited to cricket alone; there are numerous other activities and hobbies that have gained widespread attention and are being pursued with great enthusiasm.However, it is also worth noting that amidst this pursuit of happiness and financial gain, there exists a subset of individuals who prioritize making money over personal interests. This shift in priorities can sometimes lead to the adoption of unhealthy habits or hobbies that may not necessarily contribute to personal growth or well-being. For instance, drinking alcohol has become a popular pastime among certain groups, particularly those with lower incomes, who may view it as a way to unwind or socialize, despite its potential negative impacts on health and finances.In conclusion, while the current generation's embrace of the latest trends can be a positive force, driving innovation and happiness, it is essential to maintain a balance between pursuing financial goals and nurturing personal interests. By doing so, individuals can ensure that their hobbies and activities contribute to their overall well-being, rather than detract from it. Ultimately, finding joy and fulfillment in life's pursuits, whether they be cricket, reading, or any other activity, is key to a happy and productive life."
701;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. In this essay, the reason for wasting food and the acts which can be done by humans to reduce the amount of food one throws away will be thorougly discussed.Firstly, people waste food as one tends to be satisfied with the amount one eats. Thus, people order food more than one can eat as one can not estimate the amount of food. The amount of food one person can consume differs on one's conditions at that moment. The conditions include mood, physical features and activities one did on that particular day. Furthermore, one wants to taste all sorts of food, however, one can not eat all of those. Sometimes, people order food which are well decorated just to take a photo of it and upload it on social media such as Instagram. After taking photo, people just leave the food. The above mentioned reasons can be the causes of wastage of food.Apparently, people can reduce the amount of food they throw away. The restaurants can provide more informations about the amount and taste briefly to avoid the situation that consumers can not finish the food and are dissatisfied with the taste or smell. Moreover, consumers have to make a wise decision so that they do not waste both food and money. People should co-operate to reduce the wastage of food as it causes pollution on land. It leads to bad smell and brings insects to the areas.Conclusively, it is quite clear that people greatly waste food and there are a few ways for people to follow so as to reduce the amount of waste food.;"The phenomenon of food waste has become a pressing issue in today's society. One of the primary reasons behind this problem is the tendency for individuals to be satisfied with the amount they eat, regardless of the actual amount of food they can consume. This discrepancy often leads to a significant amount of food being left uneaten and ultimately discarded. The amount of food one can eat varies greatly depending on their conditions at that moment, such as their hunger level, mood, and physical activity. However, people often fail to consider these factors when serving themselves or ordering food, resulting in excess food that goes to waste.Another contributing factor to food waste is the growing trend of ordering food solely for its aesthetic appeal. With the rise of social media, people are increasingly ordering dishes that are visually appealing, with the primary intention of taking a photo of it to post online. This phenomenon, often referred to as ""food for Instagram,"" has led to a surge in demand for elaborately decorated dishes that are often too large or too elaborate for one person to consume. Once the photo has been taken, the food is often left uneaten, and its fate is sealed – it will be discarded, contributing to the staggering amounts of food waste.It is imperative that we become more mindful of our eating habits and the amount of food we consume. By being more considerate of our actual hunger levels and the conditions that affect our appetite, we can reduce the amount of food that goes to waste. Furthermore, we should strive to move away from the culture of ordering food solely for its visual appeal and instead focus on the true purpose of food – to nourish and sustain us. By adopting these habits, we can significantly reduce food waste and work towards a more sustainable food culture."
1354;Nowadays people waste a lot of food, why is this happening and how to reduce waste?;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?At the time when famines heavily strike impoverished third world countries, many people living in wealthy countries waste tremendous amounts of food daily. In my opinion, understanding the probable reasons of this phenomenon is important and may lead us to some applicable solutions that will result in reducing food waste.The low cost of food seems to be one of the obvious reasons, exacerbating the problem. Due to the revolutionary technological achievements, people have increased both the quality and the quantity of their crops. In turn, according to the laws of supply and demand, the prices of the crops have immensely dropped. A recent study of the FAO stated that the global crops prices have dropped 50 per cent over the last decade. This enabled people to buy excessive amounts of food without a real need.Furthermore, the absence of strict regulations to discourage or punish this attitude can also be considered a major cause. Not everyone is aware that wasting food may create problems. Consequently, they are likely to resist any calls for controlling the consumption of dietary supplies unless they are forced by the power of law. Several countries in the world saw a drop in their national food waste after implementing a ban on the excessive purchasing of food.Fortunately, there are some possible approaches that can be adopted by both people and governments. Firstly, raising the awareness of this issue is immensely important. Using social media platforms can draw public attention to the potential dangers of food waste and how communities can confront it. Secondly, enforcing laws that prohibit the wasting of food by people and companies will deter such harmful practice.In conclusion, the decreased price of food as well as lack of regulations allowed the unfortunate trend of throwing away food to continue. I believe that creating awareness and legislation are parts of a straightforward solution to this issue.The writer explored the reasons for throwing away food and suggested some solutions, effortlessly conveying his/her ideas in this well-written IELTS essay. The information is presented in an orderly, logical and coherent way. A wide range of vocabulary is used in this written response. The sentence structures are varied and the vocabulary is impressive. Overall, this essay could achieve IELTS Band 8.;"The issue of food waste has become a pressing concern globally, with a significant amount of edible food being discarded by households and establishments. It is estimated that a substantial portion of food purchased from shops and restaurants ends up in landfills, rather than on dining tables. In my opinion, there are several reasons why people waste food. Firstly, the abundance of food options available in supermarkets and restaurants often leads to over purchasing, resulting in more food being bought than can be consumed before its expiration date. Additionally, the lack of meal planning and poor food storage habits contribute to the problem.Furthermore, the ""use by"" and ""best before"" dates on food products can be misleading, causing people to discard edible food prematurely. To mitigate this issue, several measures can be taken. Firstly, consumers can adopt a more mindful approach to food shopping by planning meals, making shopping lists, and avoiding impulse buys. Restaurants and shops can also play a role by offering smaller portions, or ""doggy bags"" to encourage customers to take home uneaten food. Moreover, education and awareness campaigns can be launched to inform people about the environmental and economic impacts of food waste, and to provide guidance on proper food storage and meal planning.Ultimately, reducing food waste requires a collective effort from individuals, businesses, and governments. By implementing these strategies, we can significantly decrease the amount of food that is needlessly discarded, and work towards a more sustainable food system. By being more mindful of our food consumption and waste, we can make a positive impact on the environment, and help ensure that the valuable resources used to produce food are not squandered."
25;Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?;"It is a serious problem that there is an inadequate number of students who tend to select science as their major subject in universities in many countries. In my view, students may think that studying science has not a good career path. Also, this issue may deeply affect the international state of a country.The main reason why people do not think to study science is that they may see science as something unpractical, and potentially, they are hard to find a job when they graduate. Students are generally afraid that there is no employment opportunity after they graduate from university. Unlike engineering and business management, in which fields employers provide plenty of vocational positions for graduated students because there are lots of companies activating in these fields and universities may provide some practical training courses and internships. Students studying science have a relatively narrow way to walk, and may just be scientists. Moreover, although a successful scientist can get a massive bonus from some prizes, it is too hard to accomplish and is more likely to fail. Therefore, Students will avoid taking those risks and choose other subjects that are relatively stable and easy to find a job.This trend will eventually decrease the state of a country. Developing science can provide a strong and firm foundation for a country to establish a healthy and prosperous community. If there are not enough scientists, the whole scientific ability will decrease. Not only will the government pay extra money to other foreign countries to buy the required technology such as military equipment, but the public needs to spend more time and pay more effort to maintain the international standard production rate of a country. It is extremely dangerous that a nation easily suffers from a financial crisis and, finally, it influences the living standard of its citizens and causes damage to its financial systems.In summary, while science is regarded as a ""useless"" subject because of its narrow career path and low success rate, it is vital that the economic systems would be affected if a country develop without scientists.";"The notion that science is a ""useless"" subject has become a prevailing sentiment among many individuals. This misconception stems from the perceived narrow career path and low success rate associated with pursuing a career in science. It is true that the journey to becoming a successful scientist can be arduous and unforgiving, with a high likelihood of failure. Moreover, the financial rewards for scientists are often limited, until they achieve a groundbreaking discovery, at which point they may be eligible for massive bonuses from prestigious prizes. However, these accolades are extremely difficult to attain, making them the exception rather than the rule.Despite these challenges, the importance of developing science cannot be overstated. A strong foundation in science is essential for a country to establish a healthy and prosperous community. Science plays a critical role in addressing some of the world's most pressing issues, such as disease, climate change, and food security. By investing in scientific research and education, a country can develop innovative solutions to these problems, leading to improved healthcare, sustainable economic growth, and a higher quality of life for its citizens.Furthermore, the benefits of science extend beyond the scientific community, with spin-off technologies and discoveries often having a profound impact on various aspects of society. For instance, advances in medical science have led to the development of life-saving treatments and vaccines, while breakthroughs in environmental science have informed policies to mitigate the effects of climate change. Therefore, rather than viewing science as a ""useless"" subject, we should recognize its potential to drive positive change and work towards fostering a culture that values and supports scientific inquiry and discovery. By doing so, we can unlock the full potential of science to build a brighter, more sustainable future for generations to come."

By making these lifestyle changes, we can set an example for others to follow, creating a ripple effect that can lead to a healthier and more wholesome community. Ultimately, the key to creating a healthy, wholesome, and clean world lies in our ability to recognize and change our bad habits, replacing them with good ones. By doing so, we can take the first step towards a brighter, healthier future for ourselves and for generations to come.
1418;People attend college or university for many different reasons (for example, new experiences, career preparation, or to increase knowledge).;Why do you think people attend college or university? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.Many people after their high school years for several reason which they choose . I believe that the most common reason why people to have new experiences on life , to prepare for a career, and to increase their knowledge of their personality.Firstly, many people to have new experience in life. Many students leave their home and move to live when they go to university. This is the first time that they had to make a resolution on their own, without their parents’ help. Making their own decisions will increase their knowledge of themselves. Moreover, students university can meet different students from different nationalities and religions so students can learn about different around the world.Secondly, many people go to university or collage to prepare for a career. Career training is becoming more important nowadays to young people compared to old people. At college, students learn many skills for their career and they internship with a lot of chances. All of these prepare them for their career.Also, students attend university or college to increase their self-knowledge of their personality life. They attend increase their knowledge in subjects which they find interesting. For example, many students study science because they are in science but they work .To sum up, I think people should not only focus on a career when they go to university or college. They have to follow to have new experience and knowledge about their personality and the great world around them which they live in.;After completing high school, many individuals opt to pursue further education or take a break to explore their options. There are several reasons behind this decision, with the most common being the desire for new experiences, the need to prepare for a career, and the quest to increase self-knowledge and understand their personality better.One of the primary motivations for people to take a path after high school is the yearning for new experiences in life. This could involve traveling, volunteering, or taking on internships that expose them to different cultures, environments, and work ethics. Such experiences are invaluable as they help individuals broaden their perspectives, develop independence, and cultivate skills that are not limited to academic knowledge.Another significant reason is the preparation for a career. Many careers require specialized training or education beyond high school. By pursuing further education or vocational training, individuals can gain the specific skills and knowledge needed to succeed in their chosen profession. This preparatory phase is crucial as it lays the groundwork for a successful and fulfilling career, allowing individuals to make informed decisions about their professional paths.Lastly, the journey after high school is also a time for self-discovery and increasing one's knowledge of their personality.

1253;People living in large cities have to face many problems in everyday life. What are those problems?Should the government encourage people to move to regional towns?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is not surprise to see that major cities are struggling with various issues which may associate with goverment and public issues as well.These issues are mild in some cities where as severe and vulnerable in few cities.Some of the common problems are increased crime rate,reduced safety,air pollution,noise pollution,flood,mechanical life and reduced greenery.The main cause for the above issues are increased population,uncontrolled carbon emission,poorly planned road and other public facilities such as underground drainage,contaminated water,roads and electricity.In general if the government take steps to control the above mentioned issues by implenting good law and orders which can improve public safety and happiness.Assist the sanitary boards with proper funding which may help to reduce water stagnant during rainy season.Funding for new research and developments may enhance to clear air and water pollution which can bring good health to the local residents.In contrast government may consider to develop the nearest towns with basic facilities such as modern housing,educational advancements,good roads,water and sanitary facilities. These facilities enhance the people to move to smaller town which may enhance to manage the key issues which are currently facing in the major cities.For instance Delhi,Capital of India seriously struggling with severe air pollution and lack of security which is heavily populated.Researches says that these problems can be reduced if the population rate is reduced.Meantime some group of people suggests that if the government may adopt new technology or structure which are following by any successful cities in the world.I personally feels that this also could be a better solution if it can be adopted by the government.By arguing the possitive and negative impacts it is difficult to conclude which option may works better to sove the issues.;The rapid growth and development of urban areas have led to numerous problems that affect the quality of life for its inhabitants. Some of the common issues faced by city dwellers include an increased crime rate, reduced safety, air pollution, noise pollution, floods, a mechanical life, and reduced greenery. These problems not only hinder the well-being of citizens but also pose significant challenges to the environment and ecosystem.The main cause of these issues can be attributed to the increased population, uncontrolled carbon emissions, and poorly planned roads and public facilities. The influx of people to urban areas has put a strain on existing infrastructure, leading to congestion, pollution, and decreased safety. Furthermore, the lack of effective planning and management of public facilities has exacerbated these problems, making cities less livable and sustainable.However, if the government takes proactive steps to address these issues, the quality of life in urban areas can be significantly improved. Implementing good law and order can enhance public safety, reducing crime rates and promoting a sense of security among citizens. Additionally, enforcing strict regulations on carbon emissions and promoting sustainable practices can mitigate air and noise pollution, creating a healthier environment. Well-planned roads and public facilities can also help to reduce congestion, floods, and other environmental hazards. By taking these measures, the government can improve public safety and happiness, making cities more livable and sustainable for future generations. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that urban areas are well-managed and planned, providing a high quality of life for its citizens.
645;People often think about creating an ideal society, but most of the times fail in making this happen.What is your opinion about an ideal societyHow can we create an ideal society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"One of the ambition of the people is to create a harmonious community to live in. Unfortunately, individuals often fail to create one. This essay will discuss what is an ideal society, as well as ways on how to make it happen.An ideal community is a place where peace of mind over shadows fear. We all now that everyone wants a place that is criminal free. For example, people can just walk in an aisle without thinking of being raped or kidnapped. Moreover, it is a community in which discrimination, prejudice and racism is prohibited. In short, everyone is treated equally regardless of gender, colors, religions, social status, jobs and looks. It also means that, people can just walk in and out of a hospital or establishments without being looked down or degraded by other people especially those with high status.However, it is difficult for people to meet this kind of standards. This mainly because nobody is made perfect and as a human being we are mostly dominated by hatred, jealousy and selfishness. Although people fail to have a perfect society, there are some ways on how to have a near perfect place to live. First of all, government should make the lives of the people a better one by being an active role model to the citizens. There should not be corruption involve amongst the higher ups. Also, as what the saying goes ""learning should start at home"", it means that, parents should the take the initiative to educate their children proper manners in dealing with other people. In Japan, children were taught in a very young age on how to treat other people. That is why they always bow down their head as a sign of respect.To conclude, creating an essential environment can be challenging and demanding for all of us. Eventhough, it is impossible to make, each one of us can has the capacity to contribute to make society an almost perfect one.";An ideal community is a utopian dream where peace of mind prevails, and fear takes a backseat. It is a place where everyone is treated with equality and respect, regardless of their gender, skin color, religion, social status, job, or physical appearance. In such a community, every individual has the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential without facing discrimination or prejudice.However, achieving this ideal is a daunting task. Human biases and prejudices often get in the way, making it challenging for people to meet these lofty standards. Nevertheless, it is not impossible to create a near-perfect place to live. One of the key ways to achieve this is by starting from the grassroots level. Parents play a crucial role in shaping the minds of future generations, and it is their responsibility to educate their children on proper manners and values.By teaching children the importance of empathy, kindness, and respect for others, parents can lay the foundation for a harmonious community. As children grow up, they will carry these values with them, treating others with dignity and respect, regardless of their background or appearance. Moreover, parents can also lead by example, demonstrating tolerance and understanding in their own interactions with others. By doing so, they will create a ripple effect, inspiring others to do the same, and gradually, the community will become a more inclusive and peaceful place. Ultimately, it is the collective effort of individuals, starting from the family unit, that can help create a community that is close to ideal, where everyone can live in harmony and mutual respect.
1326;People should follow the local customs and traditions, when they come to live in a new country. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The globalised world these days makes it simpler than ever before for people to relocate and start building a life in a new country. As everyone comes from their own cultural background, a question arises of whether or not people should be expected to follow the customs of their host country. I completely agree with the view that while learning about the local customs may require some time and effort, it is valuable and will aid the integration of the newcomers into society.In many cultures following the local customs means showing respect, which is an important moral value in nearly every culture. The opposite is also true: disregarding traditions is often seen as a sign of disrespect. In order to establish good neighbourly relationships and feel welcome in the new place, it is important to demonstrate the effort to become part of the community. By expressing an interest in learning traditions, new arrivals gain a chance to interact with their neighbours and colleagues, get to know them and build some connections in the new country.Another positive aspect is the enhanced feeling of belonging that people get from participating in activities others around them are doing. When a national festival is in full swing, standing on the sidelines might make people feel excluded and perhaps even homesick, whereas joining others opens up opportunities to attend special events together, go to parties, meet new people and feel part of the celebrations. In Australia, for example, Easter is a very special time of the year and some of the traditional activities include Easter egg decoration and gifting, and baking hot cross buns; sharing your designs and recipes with others is an excellent conversation starter.In conclusion, learning the customs and traditions of one’s new country doesn’t mean a loss of their own culture. On the contrary, it is an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of cultural connections and should be embraced as a positive experience.";"The world today is more interconnected than ever, and this globalisation has made it easier for individuals to relocate and start anew in a foreign country. As people settle into their new homes, they are often encouraged to adopt local customs and traditions. This is not only a practical way to navigate everyday life, but also a vital way to demonstrate respect for the host culture. In nearly every culture, showing respect is a fundamental moral value, and by following local customs, newcomers can convey their appreciation for the community that is welcoming them.By expressing an interest in learning about local traditions, they open themselves up to interactions with their neighbours and community members. This, in turn, helps them to feel welcome and integrated into their new environment. Simple actions, such as participating in local festivals, learning a few key phrases in the native language, or observing traditional dress codes, can go a long way in building bridges with the local community. Moreover, these small gestures can lead to meaningful connections and friendships, which are essential for making a new place feel like home.In essence, embracing local customs is not just about adhering to rules or norms; it's about fostering a sense of community and belonging. As the world continues to become more interconnected, the importance of cultural sensitivity and respect will only continue to grow. By taking the time to learn about and engage with local traditions, newcomers can turn their new house into a home, and their new community into a support system. This mutual respect and understanding is the cornerstone of successful integration and will ultimately enrich the lives of both the newcomers and the community they join."
1370;People should not work beyond the retirement age (agree/disagree);Some believe that people should not continue to work once they reach the age of retirement. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your experience.In recent years, with the improvement in healthcare sector and better , people are able to live longer and contribute to the economic progress of a nation more, compared to the past. Some see this as an entirely positive development, while others point out the drawbacks of working beyond the retirement age.Delaying retirement enables individuals to actively contribute to the society. On a personal level, working past retirement age provides an avenue for individuals to remain not only physically but also mentally active. Moreover, this option empowers the ageing population to be financially independent and economically self-sustainable past retirement age. In countries with growing ageing population such as Singapore, for instance, citizens are given an option to work beyond their retirement age based on the demands of their job and their capability to handle these tasks. Hence, working beyond retirement age empowers workers, ensures economic progression of the nation, and alleviates the challenges faced by an ageing population.On the flip side, working beyond the retirement age may result in adverse health impacts on workers and a decrease in productivity levels. In Japan, the suicide rates have recently been increasing due to rising stress levels at work faced by the ageing population who are pushed to work beyond their optimal capacity. Escalating stress levels from work to various health complications putting a strain on the healthcare system. Hence, working beyond retirement age may worsen the overall welfare of individuals and adversely impact the economy.To sum up, though working beyond retirement age health hazards leading to reduction in productivity levels, it seems to me that the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion, by assessing the capability of individuals and tailoring their jobs to their health profile, firms and companies should actively involve their workers to be productive beyond their retirement age.This essay is an excellent example of IELTS Band 8 writing. The author presents sound arguments making his/her point of view very clear, examples are being used to support the writer’s points and the organisation of information is handled very well. There are some minor inaccuracies, however, they wouldn’t affect the score much in the real test. Well done!;The notion that individuals should cease working upon reaching retirement age has sparked intense debate. While some argue that retirement marks the end of one's working life, I firmly disagree. In my opinion, the decision to continue working beyond retirement age should be a personal choice, driven by individual circumstances and desires.On the one hand, continuing to work can have numerous physical and mental health benefits. Many people find that staying engaged in their profession helps to maintain their cognitive abilities, reduces the risk of depression, and provides a sense of purpose. For instance, my grandmother, who is in her early seventies, still works part-time as a librarian. She has stated that her job keeps her mind active, allows her to stay connected with her community, and gives her a reason to wake up in the morning. Her experience exemplifies the positive impact that continued work can have on one's quality of life.On the other hand, some may argue that older workers can hinder the job market by occupying positions that could be filled by younger, more energetic individuals. However, this perspective overlooks the valuable experience and knowledge that seasoned workers bring to their organizations. Many companies recognize the benefits of retaining older employees, who can mentor, train, and guide less experienced staff members. For example, a friend's father, a retired engineer, was hired by his former company as a consultant, where he shares his expertise with junior engineers, ensuring the successful completion of complex projects.In conclusion, I strongly believe that people should have the freedom to choose whether or not to continue working beyond retirement age. With the numerous benefits that working can provide, both for the individual and society, it is essential that we support and encourage those who wish to remain active in the workforce. Ultimately, the decision to retire should be based on personal preference, health, and financial considerations, rather than a rigid age limit.
709;People think that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. Others believe that there are other alternative solutions for reducing crime.Discuss both views and give your opinion on this topic.;"Nowadays the sentences that judges give to criminals is always at the centre of attention of the society; some people think that the best way to reduce the amount of crime cases is to give longer prison sentences, while, others say that there are other alternative ways to stop it. This essay will talk about both views and, at the end, I will give my opinion about the argument.It is always more common to see long sentences for criminals, also if their crimes are not too bad to deserve that type of punishment; the reason why the court gives to them long sentences is because they think that staying a lot in prison will make the criminals understand that what they did is wrong and, next time, they will think twice before doing something bad or against the law.However long sentences can go against the human rights because they will take away from prisoners years of their life; for this reason, some people think that it can be better if, instead of stay close in a jail without doing nothing, they can be used in various works that will make them useful for the society and better person at the end of the sentence, like cleaning the city, helping old people in retirement homes and also cook for poor people.I think that there are other ways to stop crime instead of giving long punishments, also because everyone should have a second chance in their life and, more importantly, teach and show to prisoners different aspects of the community will help cities to become better places with less crimes to stop.This essay talked about two different types of views about crime sentences in our society, with my own opinion about the argument in the last part of it.";The debate on how to reduce crime rates has been ongoing, with some advocating for longer prison sentences and others proposing alternative methods. On one hand, some people believe that imposing harsher penalties will deter individuals from committing crimes. The reasoning behind this is that the fear of lengthy prison terms will discourage potential offenders from engaging in criminal activities. This approach is based on the idea that punishment serves as a deterrent, and therefore, longer sentences will lead to a decrease in crime rates.On the other hand, others argue that there are more effective ways to tackle crime. They suggest that addressing the root causes of crime, such as poverty, unemployment, and lack of education, is a more sustainable solution. This perspective emphasizes the importance of rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders into society, rather than simply punishing them. Proponents of this view also point to alternative measures like community service, counseling, and job training programs as more effective in reducing recidivism rates.After considering both perspectives, I personally believe that alternative methods are more likely to reduce crime rates in the long run. While longer prison sentences may provide temporary deterrence, they do not address the underlying issues that lead to criminal behavior. In contrast, alternative approaches that focus on rehabilitation, education, and social reintegration have been shown to reduce recidivism and contribute to safer communities. Moreover, these methods are more humane and cost-effective, as they do not rely on expensive prison systems. Ultimately, a holistic approach that combines elements of both views, with a focus on prevention and rehabilitation, is likely to yield the most positive outcomes in reducing crime rates.
1286;People today find their lives more and more dominated by their jobs. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is certainly true that many people around the world find their lives dominated by the work that they have to do. This is shown when you realise how people’s work, and how much time, effort and resources they devote to it, is often the subject of conversation.Most people depend on their jobs to generate an income to pay for their lives’ necessities and luxuries, and so work can naturally become a dominating focus. As this is an important part of nearly everyone’s everyday life, it can seem that people’s lives are indeed becoming more influenced by their jobs. Whether this emphasis on work is more significant now than in previous years is debatable. In many developed countries around the world, there are procedures in place to help people with finding work, providing unemployment benefits, ensuring education, and offering pension payments. In times past, these provisions were not in place and a job or business was required to provide the necessary income.Therefore, in spite of increases in the cost of living in many places around the world, it can be argued there is actually less pressure than in previous years to keep one’s job and perform well at it. This, in turn, would lead to people’s lives being less influenced by their jobs today. It is also true that in the past, people were as responsible and focused on doing well in their responsibilities as today and so, in this respect, the people of the past would be equally dedicated to their work as people are today.While I agree that people’s lives today are often dominated by their jobs, I feel that the current situation is not necessarily worse than before. In fact, it may be more positive, due to the fewer pressures to earn money in many countries.;The Domination of Work in Modern LifeIn today's fast-paced world, many individuals find their lives revolving around their work. The emphasis on work has become a dominant force, influencing every aspect of their daily lives. Whether this focus on work is more pronounced now than in previous years is a topic of debate among scholars and researchers. However, one thing is certain - the significance of work in modern life cannot be overstated.In many developed countries, governments have implemented various procedures to support individuals in their pursuit of employment. These measures include job placement services, which help people find suitable work opportunities. Additionally, unemployment benefits provide a safety net for those who have lost their jobs, ensuring they have a minimum level of financial security. Furthermore, pension payments offer a sense of security for retirees, allowing them to enjoy their post-work life without excessive financial worries.These support systems demonstrate the importance governments place on work and the well-being of their citizens. By providing a framework for finding and maintaining employment, governments aim to promote economic stability and growth. Nevertheless, the question remains whether the emphasis on work has increased over time. Some argue that the rise of technology and global competition has created a more demanding work environment, while others claim that the nature of work has remained relatively consistent.Regardless of the answer, one thing is clear: work plays a vital role in modern life. The procedures in place to support employment and provide financial security underscore the significance of work in maintaining a stable and prosperous society. As the world continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how the emphasis on work changes and adapts to the needs of future generations. Ultimately, finding a balance between work and personal life remains essential for individuals to maintain their overall well-being and happiness.
1264;Percentage of UK people who consumed daily recommended amount of fruit and vegetable in 2002, 2006 and 2010.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar graph compares the proportion of UK citizens in terms of their consumption of daily recommended portions of fruits and vegetables in three different years which are 2002, 2006, and 2010.Overall, females consumed the highest percentage of their recommended healthy food, followed by males, and last are the children.additionally the year 2006 had witnessed the vastest consumption of vegetables and fruits among all given years.Women ate exactly 25% of the daily adviced dose of natural food in the year 2002, 32% in 2006, and 26% in 2010, however men took 22% of the recommended dose in the year 2002, 26% in 2006, and 24% in 2010.On the other hand younger individuals only consumed 11%, 18%, and 16% of the daily requirements of veggies and fruits in the years 2002, 2006, and 2010 respectively. It appears that residents of the UK had eaten the highest daily requirements of greens and fruits in the year 2006 as compared to the years 2006 and 2010.;The bar graph provides a comparative analysis of the consumption habits of UK citizens in relation to their daily recommended portions of fruits and vegetables over three distinct years: 2002, 2006, and 2010. A noteworthy trend emerges from the data, indicating that females consistently exhibited the highest consumption rate of the recommended daily intake of healthy foods.Across the three years, females demonstrated a significant adherence to the recommended dietary guidelines, with a considerable proportion of them consuming the required portions of fruits and vegetables. This suggests that females in the UK prioritized a healthy diet, possibly due to increased health awareness or a greater inclination towards nutritionally balanced meals.In contrast, males trailed behind females in terms of consuming the recommended daily portions, although they still maintained a respectable consumption rate. This difference could be attributed to various factors, including dietary preferences, lifestyle, or awareness of health benefits associated with a balanced diet.Children, unfortunately, had the lowest consumption rate of the recommended fruits and vegetables across all three years. This is a concerning trend, as a diet rich in fruits and vegetables is crucial for growth, development, and the establishment of healthy eating habits from a young age. The lower consumption rates among children may indicate a need for targeted nutritional education or interventions to encourage healthier eating habits among younger populations.In conclusion, the bar graph highlights an encouraging trend among females in the UK, who lead in the consumption of recommended daily portions of fruits and vegetables. However, it also underscores the need for strategies to improve dietary habits among males and, more urgently, among children, to foster a healthier population across all demographics.
1402;Popular events like the football world cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The World Cup football and the Olympics are held worldwide with great national support and expectations. As a fan of those competitions, I agree with the idea that sporting events can be necessary for international relations and national unity, but only partially, because such events can have unintended effects on relationships between countries.First of all, the World Cup, Olympics and other international games work for easing tensions among different nations. For example, South and North Korea have football games regularly two nations a chance to understand each other . In the mid of North Korean supporters came to South Korea with the footballers and they were very excited during the sporting events. Even if it sounds ridiculous, many South Koreans were quite surprised at that moment when North Koreans shouted and cried during the match. We all realized that they were very normal sports fans even though they were occasionally very secretive. Through the sports, two divided nations could reduce their political and ideological tensions and could feel the patriotic unity.On the other hand, some sports matches can make international relations worse. For instance, football or baseball games between Korea and Japan are always big matches in two countries where . Sometimes, after the matches, the two rivals blame each other and their patriotic emotions explode in an aggressive way. scenario is that the troubles caused by losing games affect the players directly.;The world of sports has long been a platform for international competition and camaraderie, with events like the World Cup football and the Olympics drawing in massive global audiences. As a fan of these competitions, I firmly believe that sporting events play a vital role in fostering international relations and national unity. The sheer scale and spectacle of these events have the power to bring people together, transcending cultural and linguistic barriers. Nations come together to support their teams, and the spirit of friendly competition promotes a sense of global community.However, it is also important to acknowledge that such events can have unintended effects on relationships between countries. The intense nationalism and competitive fervor that often accompany these events can sometimes boil over into tensions and conflicts between nations. The pressure to perform and the high stakes involved can lead to diplomatic incidents,ingenuity and rivalry between countries. Furthermore, the hosting of such events can also be used as a political tool, with nations using the platform to showcase their economic and military prowess,ingenuity, which can be perceived as a threat or a form of cultural imperialism by other countries.Despite these potential drawbacks, I still believe that the benefits of sporting events like the World Cup and the Olympics far outweigh the costs. When done correctly, these events have the power to promote cross-cultural understanding, break down stereotypes, and foster people-to-people diplomacy. As a fan, I have witnessed firsthand the incredible sense of national pride and unity that these events can inspire, and I firmly believe that they will continue to play a vital role in shaping international relations and promoting global harmony in the years to come.
913;Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:In the past, sporting champions used to be motivated primarily by the desire to win a match or to break world records. These days they are more likely to be motivated by prize money and the opportunity to be famous.What message does this send to young people and how does this attitude to sport affect the sports themselves?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;There were many sport competitions organized after the World-War II since the first Olympic games was held in Athena, in 1963, to bring the world together again. Previously, sport competition was seen as an opportunity for the athletes to break the world records for the pride of their home countries. However, nowadays, people are more inclined to win the match because of money reward and glory. I believe that young people should be more encouraged to achieve their goals to become a champion so that the value of sport competition would not be purely for commercial purpose.In the last decades, there have been a lot of sport competitions being held from national to global level. The athletes were trained by the supported teams to do their best to become the world champion. It was the pride of such athlete to win and see their national flags were rised after the match. Over the years, sport has become more commercial following its popularity to attract global audiences. Many athletes are paying more attention for the opportunity to win the match for commercial purpose. For example, one wants to become a famous soccer player so that they could become the ambassador of Adidas and get more income out of it.Due to the temptation for getting famous and having more money, there are people who choose to play unfairly during a competition. Instead of focusing on increasing their skills, they would cheat to win the game for money. For example, a soccer player may use thyroid injection for boosting their energy level even though it is strictly prohibited. Moreover, sport is not seen anymore to promote peace and solidarity among people from different cultural backgrounds but for the chance to get the superficial gloriness.To conclude, even if the motivation has shifted, the young people should learn to focus more on becoming a real champion and play fairly so that they can become the best athletes in thier expertise while the money and glory would follow them after.;The world of sports has undergone a significant transformation in recent years. As its popularity continues to soar, sport has become increasingly commercialized, attracting global audiences and lucrative sponsorship deals. While this trend has brought numerous benefits, such as increased exposure and financial rewards for athletes, it has also led to a shift in priorities. Many athletes are now more focused on winning at all costs, rather than honing their skills and competing with integrity.The commercialization of sport has created an environment where athletes are under immense pressure to perform and win. As a result, some individuals are prioritizing the opportunity to win over the pursuit of excellence. Instead of dedicating themselves to rigorous training and skill development, they are seeking shortcuts to success. Unfortunately, this has led to a rise in unsportsmanlike conduct, with some athletes resorting to unfair tactics to gain a competitive edge.The consequences of this trend are far-reaching and disturbing. Not only does it undermine the fundamental principles of fair play and sportsmanship, but it also sends a damaging message to young athletes and fans around the world. The emphasis on winning at all costs has created a culture where cheating and deception are tolerated, and even encouraged. This not only tarnishes the reputation of individual athletes and teams but also erodes the trust and integrity of the sport as a whole.Ultimately, the commercialization of sport has created a paradox. While it has brought unprecedented attention and resources to the world of athletics, it has also compromised the very values that make sport so compelling and inspiring. As fans and stakeholders, we must recognize the importance of preserving the integrity and spirit of competition, and encourage athletes to prioritize skill development, sportsmanship, and fair play over the pursuit of victory at any cost.
903;Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:Some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by giving them extra money. This practice can act as an incentive for some but may also have a negative impact on others.To what extent is this style of management effective?Are there better ways of encouraging employees to work hard?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Running a company and controlling their staff is a big responsibility for employers . In general, employers should have a great vision about the future of their own company and how to improve it in a better way .To start with, some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by simply giving them more many. In addition, that practice can act as a good source of motivation, you can see that your hard work and your extra hours wasn't waste after all .On the other hand, this style of management may affect tha company and their community in a negative way . For example, the manager of the institution may be more focused on just one employee who's always have the extra credit for the work therefore the other employees work hard for nothing and that leave a bad idea that they clearly work for just having that extra money and rewards from the manager .Beside that, employees will be affected and their productivity will change and drop even more and all of that is a result on how the management of a company impact their work and their effort of doing more .To sum it up, all the members in that company worked so hard, a little credit for their effort and long hours of developing their company and rewards them for it won't do any harm . Not to mention, a manager can reward the staff of the institution by giving them a day or two off or basically a three hours break . Anything that make them really satisfied after their long and efficient work towards the developing of the company.;The practice of rewarding exceptional staff members with monetary incentives is a common approach used by some employers. The idea behind this strategy is to motivate employees to strive for excellence and contribute significantly to the company's growth and success. By offering more money, the employer aims to demonstrate appreciation for the employee's hard work and dedication. This approach can lead to increased job satisfaction, productivity, and employee retention, as staff members feel valued and recognized for their efforts.However, on the other hand, this style of management may have negative consequences for the company and its community. Overemphasizing monetary rewards can create an environment where employees prioritize personal gain over teamwork, collaboration, and the company's overall well-being. This can lead to a competitive, rather than cooperative, work environment, where employees may be more focused on individual achievements rather than collective success. Furthermore, an over-reliance on monetary incentives can also lead to an uneven distribution of wealth within the company, potentially causing resentment and dissatisfaction among staff members who do not receive such rewards.Additionally, an excessive focus on monetary rewards can have broader negative impacts on the community. It can perpetuate a culture of materialism, where the value of work is solely measured by financial gain, rather than the positive contributions it makes to society. This can have long-term consequences, such as undermining social cohesion and community values. In conclusion, while offering monetary rewards can be an effective way to motivate employees, it is crucial for employers to adopt a more nuanced approach, one that balances financial incentives with other forms of recognition and rewards, to foster a positive and productive work environment that benefits both the company and its community.
897;Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime.Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In the UK and Australia, a jury is not provided with the defendant's previous criminal history. Some law representatives claim that this should be reverted, and the jury must be provided with this information beforehand. I fully agree with this statement since the jury will have a better understanding of the defendant's behaviour, and the final decision will be easier to understand for the audience.Having the jury the right access to the defendant's past criminal background, would provide the jury with enough information about the defendant's behaviour. This is because there are certain previous criminal behavioural patterns which allow a better profesional decision-making from the part of the jury. For example, a recent study of the Law's Practice of Melboune, has shown that around 77% of people who commit a crime, were involved in at least one criminal event in the past with similar characteristics to the current crime.On the other hand, if the jury has access to the defendant's past criminal history, it would be easier for the audience to understand the nature of the jury's final decision. This is because there have been cases in which the jury's final decision was not completely accepted by the audience or misunderstood. Therefore, providing the jury with enough criminal backgroud records of the defendant will make it clear to understand in beased of what or why the jury's final decision was made.In conclusion, in the UK and Australia, a jury does not have access to a defendant's previous criminal records, and some law representatives claim that this should be reverted. I fully agree with this statement since being provided with this documents will allow the jury a more understanding of the defendant's behaviour, and the final jury's decision will be easier to understand for the audience.;The provision of a defendant's previous criminal history to a jury has been a topic of debate in the UK and Australia. Currently, juries are not informed about a defendant's past convictions, but some law representatives argue that this should be changed. I strongly agree with this stance, as I believe that providing juries with this information would greatly enhance their understanding of the defendant's behavior and ultimately lead to more informed decisions.By knowing a defendant's previous criminal history, a jury can gain valuable insight into their character and propensity for committing crimes. This context can help jurors to better understand the motivations and intentions behind the defendant's actions, and make more informed decisions about their guilt or innocence. Without this information, juries may be left to rely solely on the evidence presented in the current case, which may not provide a complete picture of the defendant's behavior.Moreover, providing juries with a defendant's previous criminal history can also help to increase transparency and accountability in the justice system. If a defendant has a history of similar offenses, it is likely that they will continue to pose a threat to society. By taking this information into account, juries can make more nuanced decisions that balance the need for justice with the need for public safety.In conclusion, I firmly believe that juries should be provided with a defendant's previous criminal history. This information is crucial in helping juries to understand the defendant's behavior and make informed decisions. By providing this context, we can ensure that justice is served and that the community is protected from repeat offenders. Ultimately, this change would lead to more effective and efficient justice system, and I strongly support the call to revert the current practice.
1308;Professional sportsmen and sportswomen and professional entertainers can often command enormous salaries today and this situation reflects society’s dependence on being entertained.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is no secret that today’s entertainment industry is extremely popular, with nearly everyone being engaged at some time in watching TV shows, movies and sports games. The North American sports industry alone generates a massive $67.7 billion every year. With the present emphasis on entertainment, sportsmen and women and professional entertainers can earn enormous salaries, with figures in the millions for one game, appearance or film. This situation certainly does reflect today’s society’s obsession with entertainment.Many people argue that celebrities do not deserve such payment when work in other professions considered of equal or higher value to society is underpaid. A-list celebrities can make over $20 million per movie, whilst many average workers can barely make ends meet. Of course there are lots of people who say that there are better ways the money could be used, rather than allowing such a vast amount to go to just one person. This is a fairly naive point of view, though. So long as people wish to watch entertainment, advertising in turn will be present and the most watched celebrities will be able to earn high salaries, as their presence will ensure the high viewing figures the advertisers desire.Though celebrities and sportsmen and sportswomen often make very large sums of money, it can also be seen as unfair to say that they do not deserve it or propose their money be used for something else. While it is true that they did not find a cure for cancer or made a life-changing scientific discovery, their hard work and expertise created a product that the public wants to see and the high payment merely reflects their value.In conclusion, it is clear that today’s society is indeed a society obsessed with being entertained and the high salaries paid to those who entertain society clearly reflect this. The high payments, however, are not necessarily out of place or undeserved.;The issue of celebrity compensation has long been a topic of debate among the general public. Many people argue that celebrities do not deserve the exorbitant payments they receive, especially when compared to other professions that are considered of equal or higher value to society. For instance, teachers, nurses, and social workers, who play a vital role in shaping young minds, caring for the sick, and supporting vulnerable communities, are often underpaid and overworked. In contrast, celebrities can earn tens of millions of dollars for a single movie or endorsement deal, which seems unjust and disproportionate.Furthermore, many people believe that there are better ways the money could be used, rather than allowing such a vast amount to go to just one person. The vast sums of money paid to celebrities could be redirected towards addressing pressing social issues, such as poverty, education, and healthcare. This would not only benefit the community at large but also contribute to the greater good. It is hard to justify the astronomical salaries of celebrities when there are so many pressing needs that could be met with the same funds.Despite these concerns, the reality is that so long as people wish to watch entertainment, advertising will continue to be present, and the most watched celebrities will be able to earn high salaries. The demand for entertainment and the lucrative advertising revenue that comes with it will continue to drive up celebrity paychecks. Ultimately, the high salaries of celebrities are a reflection of the societal values that prioritize entertainment and celebrity culture. Until these values shift, it is likely that celebrities will continue to earn astronomical sums of money, while other valuable professions remain underpaid and underappreciated.
1311;Providing a national system in a country where the unemployed receive a regular payment only encourages people not to seek work and puts an unreasonable strain on a country’s financial resources.Discuss this statement and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;In modern day society, money is a driving force for nearly everyone. Most people aspire to be financially secure and to have the ability to live the life they want. However, not everyone is able to find paid employment, and for that reason in some countries around the world, governments have initiated a system where the unemployed receive a regular payment to enable them to survive. Some people believe it is an excellent idea, whilst others believe that it is exhausting a country’s financial resources.When looking at the positive aspects of this system, it can be said that it prevents individuals from having a private bankruptcy. When somebody becomes unemployed, he or she will have on-going costs such as rent for a dwelling, bills for water, telephone and electricity as well as the cost of food and several other things. Without a salary, this person will fall into debt, because they will be unable to cover these expenses. A national unemployment payment system will therefore prevent this person from losing nearly everything over time. Without such system, many people would become homeless and would potentially engage in criminal activities to survive. Therefore, one can say that this system is positive. Although stories are heard of people exploiting the system, usually the newly unemployed want to find a job fast in order to become financially independent again, meaning that the government does not have to support them for long.Although there are positive aspects of this system, one can also say that if the payment made by the government is too high, it will prevent people from looking for work actively. Occasionally, the payment people receive is higher than their potential salaries, deterring them from working and creating an on-going cost for the government. A potential solution for this could be providing free training and employment support to open up new career opportunities with higher income, which would motivate this group to re-enter the workforce.In conclusion, the unemployment benefits system has positive and negative aspects. Personally, I believe that the positive effects of the system outweigh the negative. The payment must remain on a level that helps people survive without regular salaries, but does not seem attractive to exploit over a longer period of time.;The concept of providing regular payments to the unemployed has been implemented in various countries around the world. This system, known as unemployment benefits, aims to support individuals who have lost their jobs, enabling them to survive and maintain a decent standard of living while they search for new employment opportunities. The idea of unemployment benefits has sparked a heated debate, with some people strongly advocating for it, while others vehemently opposing it.On the one hand, proponents of unemployment benefits argue that it is an excellent idea, as it provides a financial safety net for those who have fallen on hard times. This support can help individuals to pay their bills, feed their families, and maintain their dignity, despite their unemployment status. Moreover, unemployment benefits can also help to stimulate the economy, as recipients are more likely to spend their benefits locally, thereby boosting demand and creating jobs.On the other hand, critics of unemployment benefits argue that it is exhausting a country's financial resources. They claim that the system is often abused, with some individuals relying on benefits as a permanent source of income, rather than actively seeking employment. This, they argue, can lead to a culture of dependency and reduce the incentive for people to work. Additionally, the financial burden of funding unemployment benefits can be substantial, diverting resources away from other essential public services, such as education and healthcare.In conclusion, the unemployment benefits system has both positive and negative aspects. While it provides essential support to those in need, it also poses challenges to a country's financial sustainability. Ultimately, a balanced approach is necessary, one that supports those who are genuinely in need, while also encouraging individuals to seek employment and become self-sufficient. By striking this balance, countries can ensure that their unemployment benefits system is both effective and sustainable.
1314;Public health is becoming an urgent issue nowadays. Some argue that governments should create nutrition and food choice laws to improve public health, while others believe that it is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Public health has become an increasingly pressing issue in the modern world, with many populations facing rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related diseases. This has led to a debate as to whether governments should establish nutrition and food choice laws for the betterment of public health or if it solely falls on individuals to make wise choices. In my view, everyone should take ownership of their diet and assume responsibility for their health because it is the right choice.The argument for government-imposed nutrition and food choice laws is that they could help prevent people from making unhealthy choices which could lead to more serious illnesses down the line. For example, government regulations could limit the amount of sugar or fats allowed in food products, especially those marketed to children, and impose taxes on unhealthy snacks like chips and candy bars. This approach would also benefit those who lack the knowledge about healthy food, necessary to make informed decisions. By providing clear guidelines on what foods are healthy, and by taxing the unhealthy options higher, the government would steer individuals away from unhealthy options.However, there are also some valid arguments against governmental intervention. These types of regulations infringe upon individuals’ right to choose what they put in their bodies. After all, everyone should be free to make lifestyle choices for themselves. Additionally, there may not be enough evidence to suggest that overly restrictive regulations would have beneficial effects on public health outcomes in the long run. Since people’s love of unhealthy food is often considered an addiction, it is unlikely that a higher price or other warnings would be enough to deter individuals from purchasing unhealthy food items.In conclusion, while there can certainly be benefits associated with implementing nutrition and food choice laws at a governmental level, ultimately it should still come down to personal choice and responsibility as far as one’s diet is concerned. Governments should instead focus on providing citizens with better nutrition education, so that they can make better informed decisions about what they consume. This way, they can receive the information they need while still having autonomy over their own diets and lifestyles.;The modern world is grappling with a myriad of public health issues, with soaring rates of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related diseases posing a significant threat to populations globally. In response to these alarming trends, there have been calls for government-imposed nutrition and food choice laws as a potential solution. Proponents of such laws argue that they could play a crucial role in preventing individuals from making unhealthy choices, thereby mitigating the risk of diet-related diseases.The rationale behind this argument is that by regulating the nutritional content of food products and limiting access to unhealthy options, governments can steer their citizens towards healthier eating habits. For instance, laws that restrict the sale of sugary drinks or mandate clear nutritional labeling on food packaging are seen as measures that can protect public health. By intervening in food choices, governments can potentially reduce the burden on healthcare systems and improve overall population health.However, there are also compelling arguments against governmental intervention in food choices. Critics argue that such laws infringe upon individual freedom and personal choice, potentially leading to a paternalistic approach to public health. Moreover, education and awareness campaigns, rather than coercion, might be more effective and less intrusive ways to promote healthy eating habits. Additionally, the complexity of dietary needs and preferences, which vary greatly among individuals, suggests that a one-size-fits-all approach may not be the most effective strategy. Ultimately, while the intention behind government-imposed nutrition and food choice laws is to safeguard public health, it is crucial to weigh these intentions against the potential consequences on personal freedoms and the effectiveness of such measures. A balanced approach that combines education, public awareness, and possibly gentle nudges towards healthier choices, rather than outright bans or restrictions, may offer a more sustainable and respectful path to improving public health outcomes.
267;Reporting of crimes and other kinds of violent news on television and in newspapers can have adverse consquences. This kind of information should be restricted from being shown in the media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Reporting violent crimes and other violent issues could represents a adverse consequence sometimes. Overall, it is important to enphasyded that people are geting more and more violant and we can't blame only media as a mainly factor for those behavior.This kind of questions is almost a phylosical one and we will keeping this doubt for a long time, or even never now if people are becoming more agressive because they are more expousure to this kind of news, or if we are having more report regarding to violence just because people are getting more violent.I believe that people could feel estimulated to be a criminous person when they have a minimium certain that they won't be punish.For instance, stolen and other minimius crimes had increase at california region after they anounced that stolen under tham $1000 are consider a crime anymore. So the sensation that people could do anything wrong and that is no penalty for that, estimulates the number for stolen.In other hand, when we see some hardly rules the number of crime are dipest low, as we can see at Dubai, for instance. As all penalties are really hard and strongly implemented this place is considering highest safe.I bilieve that restricting any kind of information be showen in the media doesn't solve the problem, and, in fact, bring another new problem related to limited population information. When people know what are happening, type of crimes, etc, they could be prepare to handle with those problems and prevent theirselves.;The age-old debate about the causes of criminal behavior and how to prevent it has been a topic of discussion among scholars and policymakers for centuries. In my opinion, the notion that individuals may feel encouraged to engage in criminal activity when they are certain that they will not face punishment is a compelling one. This idea suggests that the perceived lack of consequences can be a significant motivator for individuals to commit crimes.When people believe that they can act with impunity, they may feel emboldened to engage in illicit activities without fear of reprisal. This can be particularly true in cases where the likelihood of being caught and punished is low. For instance, in areas with high levels of corruption or inadequate law enforcement, the perceived risk of punishment may be minimal, leading some individuals to view criminal activity as a viable option.Some may argue that restricting the type of information shown in the media could help to mitigate this problem. However, I firmly believe that this approach is misguided. Censoring the media may only serve to drive the discussion of illicit activities underground, making it more difficult to address the root causes of criminal behavior. Furthermore, restricting information can also have unintended consequences, such as limiting the ability of law enforcement agencies to gather intelligence and preventing the public from being informed about potential threats.Rather than relying on censorship, I believe that efforts should focus on addressing the underlying social and economic issues that contribute to criminal behavior. This can include initiatives such as education and job training programs, community outreach and engagement, and improving law enforcement practices to ensure that they are fair and effective. By tackling the root causes of criminal behavior and ensuring that individuals feel that they have a stake in their communities, we can work towards creating a safer and more just society. Ultimately, it is through a combination of these approaches that we can hope to reduce the incidence of criminal behavior and create a more secure and prosperous future for all.
1;Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Poverty represents a worldwide crisis. It is the ugliest epidemic in a region, which could infect countries in the most debilitating ways. To tackle this issue, rich countries need to help those in need and give a hand when possible. I agree that there are several ways of aiding poor countries other than financial aid, like providing countries in need with engineers, workers, and soldiers who would build infrastructure. Building universities, hospitals, and roadways. By having a solid infrastructure, poor countries would be able to monetise their profits and build a stronger and more profitable economy which would help them in the long term. Once unprivilged countries find their niche, the major hurdle would be passed and would definitely pave the way for much brighter future. However, I do disagree that financial aid does not solve poverty, it does if used properly and efficiently. The most determining factor if financial aid would be the way to go, is by identifying what type of poor countries' representative are dealing with. Some countries will have a responsible leader and some will not, with that being said, implementing a strategy, to distinguish responsible leaders from others, would tailor the type of aid rich countries could use. An example, A clear report and constant observation would be applied to track the progress and how this type of aid is being monetized. In summary, types of aid varies from country to another, and tailoring the type of aid is of paramount importance to solve this problem that had huge toll on poor countries.;Poverty is a pervasive and insidious issue that affects millions of people worldwide, representing a crisis of unprecedented proportions. It is the ugliest epidemic plaguing regions, with far-reaching consequences that can debilitate entire countries. The effects of poverty are multifaceted, leading to a lack of access to basic necessities like food, water, shelter, and healthcare. This, in turn, perpetuates a cycle of desperation and hopelessness, making it even more challenging for individuals and communities to break free from its grasp.The severity of poverty demands a collective response, particularly from wealthy nations that have the means to make a significant difference. It is imperative that rich countries extend a helping hand to those in need, providing support and resources to alleviate the burden of poverty. This can be achieved through various channels, such as foreign aid, investment in sustainable development projects, and the implementation of policies that promote economic equality and social justice.By assisting countries struggling with poverty, rich nations not only contribute to the well-being of vulnerable populations but also invest in global stability and security. Poverty is a threat that knows no borders, and its consequences can have a ripple effect, impacting economies and societies worldwide. Therefore, tackling poverty is not just a moral obligation but a strategic imperative for a more equitable and peaceful world.In conclusion, poverty is a global crisis that requires immediate attention and collective action. Rich countries have a critical role to play in supporting those in need, helping to empower communities and break the cycle of poverty. Through concerted efforts and a commitment to assisting the most vulnerable, we can work towards a future where poverty is alleviated, and every individual has the opportunity to live a dignified life.
1337;Scientists believe that the world is in danger due to environmental changes. Some people say that personal lifestyle changes should be made to reduce the damage to environment, while others think that the government should do something to help. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Environmental problems are clearly something that is often discussed in today’s world. One part of the society claims that individuals should change their habits and lifestyle to improve the ecological situation. Others, on the other hand, believe that this issue should be solved on the governmental level. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and my perspective will be offered.It is hard to deny that human kind is responsible for the current environmental situation, and it seems impossible to achieve any noticeable result in this field without the participation of vast majority of individuals. For instance, a simple lifestyle change such as introducing the separation of household rubbish can make recycling projects more convenient and efficient. Moreover, consumers can reduce their usage of plastic items and, in turn, less plastic waste will contaminate the environment.However, many people still feel that the government has more tools to prevent environmental changes. One option that the authorities have is to discourage citizens from using personal vehicles by charging high taxes and additional fees. Moreover, politicians usually have access to resources to educate people about environmental problems and promote the most important ecological projects on all levels, ranging from special courses at schools to TV shows and websites related to this topic. Furthermore, it is a key responsibility of the government to protect the environment by spending state funds on research and modern equipment. Countries where legislation protects the ecology, for example Norway, have achieved visible results and overcame most environmental problems.In conclusion, I believe that a combined approach will work best to prevent or reverse environmental changes. A contribution of every individual is just as important as the intervention from the government in order to fix existing issues and save our planet for future generations.;Environmental problems are clearly something that is often discussed in today's world. The increasing concerns about climate change, pollution, and conservation have sparked a debate about who should take responsibility for addressing these issues. One part of society claims that individuals should change their habits and lifestyle to improve the ecological situation. They argue that small actions, such as reducing plastic use, using public transport, and recycling, can collectively make a significant difference. By making conscious choices, individuals can reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to a more sustainable future.On the other hand, others believe that this issue should be solved on the governmental level. They argue that individual actions, no matter how well-intentioned, are insufficient to tackle the scale and complexity of environmental problems. Governments, they claim, have the power and resources to implement policies and regulations that can bring about significant and lasting change. For example, governments can invest in renewable energy, implement pollution controls, and establish protected areas for conservation. Moreover, they can also provide incentives for businesses and individuals to adopt environmentally friendly practices.However, it is not necessarily a question of either/or. Both individual and governmental actions are necessary to effectively address environmental problems. Individuals can create a groundswell of demand for environmental action, while governments can provide the framework and resources to support and amplify these efforts. Ultimately, the solution to environmental problems will require a collective effort from all sectors of society, including individuals, businesses, and governments. By working together, we can create a more sustainable future and mitigate the worst impacts of environmental degradation.
1373;Senior managers should have higher salaries than other employees (agree/disagree);In many countries senior positions have higher salaries compared to those of young workers of the same company. Some people think this isn’t justified. Do you agree or disagree?While some believe that rewarding those in managerial positions with higher pay packets is appropriate, not everyone agrees with this view. Personally, I am leaning towards the latter position due to negative impacts caused by significant difference in salaries within a company.For one, executive officers should know that higher than sufficient salaries are not necessary. Indeed, the higher the remuneration they receive, the more likely the company to suffer from devoid of financial capability. Furthermore, they often gain powers that money can’t buy. For instance, they often make important decisions over how to make their company thrive. They are also entitled to allocate company’s budget and designate tasks to other workers. these non-financial entitlements, they should refrain from earning more than reasonable amounts as salaries.Unreasonably high salaries granted to the executives can also afflict other employees. In fact, it is foreseeable that many employees would feel powerless or even when they find out about the huge salary gap between the executive officers’ and theirs. Accordingly, some may leave the company, and others may go on to strike and demand a pay increase. However, those actions . Therefore, unfair salary systems like this would yield unhealthy working environment for both employers and employees.In conclusion, I oppose to those in managerial roles with obscene amounts of compensation because it can cost the company its prosperity and discourage other employees . Thus it is recommended for the company to decide on the salaries of executive officers and general workers by adopting a more motivating salary system.This is a good example of an IELTS Band 8 essay. The task statement is sufficiently discussed, and the writer’s arguments are relevant and well developed. There are only 2 body paragraphs, but they are coherent and help to organise the information. Linking words are used appropriately to sequence ideas. Skillful use of synonyms throughout the essay demonstrates the writer’s vocabulary. Some of the expressions used aren’t entirely suitable or accurate, but there aren’t many of them. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.0.;The disparity in salaries between senior positions and young workers within the same company is a widespread phenomenon in many countries. While senior positions often come with higher salaries, the question remains as to whether this pay gap is justified. In my opinion, I agree that this disparity is not entirely justified.On one hand, senior positions typically require more experience, knowledge, and responsibility, which may warrant higher salaries. Senior employees have invested years in acquiring skills, building relationships, and taking on additional responsibilities, making their contributions to the company more valuable. However, this does not necessarily mean that young workers are any less valuable to the organization. Many young workers bring fresh ideas, innovative perspectives, and new skills to the table, which can be just as beneficial to the company's growth and success.Moreover, the pay gap between senior and junior positions can be discouraging for young workers. When they see that their hard work and dedication are not reflected in their salaries, they may feel undervalued and unmotivated. This can lead to a high turnover rate among young employees, which can be costly for the company in terms of recruitment and training expenses. Additionally, a narrow pay gap can foster a sense of equality and fairness within the company, leading to increased job satisfaction and productivity among all employees.In conclusion, while senior positions may require more experience and responsibility, the significant pay gap between senior and junior positions is not entirely justified. Companies should strive to create a more balanced and equitable compensation system that values and rewards the contributions of all employees, regardless of their age or position. By doing so, they can promote a more positive and productive work environment, where all employees feel valued and motivated to contribute to the company's success.
1357;Should employers pay more attention to personal qualities rather than qualifications?;"While recruiting a new employee, the employer should pay more attention to their personal qualities, rather than qualifications and experience. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and include relevant examples.Recent decades have witnessed a burgeoning growth of numerous industries; therefore, recruiting the right person for the position is crucial to the development of enterprises. But how do we determine if a person is the best fit? Advocates of conventional recruitment methods opine that this candidate must have sufficient experience and qualifications needed for that job. Nevertheless, some people argue that candidates’ personal qualities cannot be ignored. In my view, both components are of equal importance.To begin with, the conventional approach of checking potential workers’ qualifications via their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, issued qualifications and certifications from authorised organisations is vital. Apparently, whenever we submit a job application, we are always required to attach a CV while a cover letter is optional. Without a decent qualification, even if that candidate’s personal characteristics are suitable, the enterprise will need to carry out lots of skill trainings eventually.On the other hand, occasionally during an interview some HR officers ignore the significance of assessing how candidates’ individual qualities can fit in the company. Employers should assess not only candidates’ qualifications but also their enabling skills, ethics and value propositions. The more an employee’s personal qualities fit in a company’s culture and values, the more he or she is motivated to contribute to that company’s vision. KPMG is a great example of evaluating candidates’ personal qualifications and skills by utilising a game-based assessment process, followed by a video interview. This methodology enables a comprehensive assessment, and is embraced by many companies nowadays.To summarise, employers should assess both personal characteristics and formal qualifications when recruiting people as each of these elements has its own vital contribution to make in talent-seeking enterprises.This response covers the topic well. The writer’s position is clearly expressed and supported by an example, the use of paragraphing makes this essay organised and easy to follow. Linking words are used appropriately. The use of complex sentences and advanced vocabulary is impressive. Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.";When recruiting a new employee, the employer's primary focus is often on qualifications and experience. However, I strongly agree that personal qualities should be given more weightage in the recruitment process. While qualifications and experience are essential, they do not guarantee a candidate's success in a role. Personal qualities such as teamwork, adaptability, and a positive attitude can make a significant difference in an employee's performance and overall fit within the organization.For instance, a candidate with excellent qualifications and experience may struggle to work collaboratively with colleagues or adapt to changing circumstances, which can hinder their ability to deliver results. On the other hand, a candidate with strong personal qualities can quickly learn and grow into a role, even if they lack some of the desired qualifications or experience. Moreover, personal qualities such as integrity, honesty, and empathy are crucial in building trust and strong relationships with colleagues, customers, and stakeholders.Furthermore, many successful companies, such as Google and Facebook, prioritize personal qualities like creativity, innovation, and passion over traditional qualifications and experience. These companies recognize that personal qualities drive innovation, creativity, and growth, which are essential for their continued success. In conclusion, while qualifications and experience are important, I firmly believe that personal qualities should be given more attention during the recruitment process. By doing so, employers can build a more cohesive, adaptable, and successful team that drives business growth and achievement. By prioritizing personal qualities, employers can uncover hidden gems and create a more dynamic and innovative work environment.
1385;Should people spend a lot on weddings and birthday parties?;"Some people think that spending a lot on holding wedding parties, birthday parties and other celebrations is just a waste of money. Others, however, think that these are necessary for individuals and the society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Throwing parties can be expensive. While some people do not find these fancy gatherings worth what they cost, others believe such events are important to both individuals and the society.People choose to throw parties for a number of reasons. For starters, they can make better teams. Project kick-off parties are good opportunities to break the ice and help team members to know each other better. Celebrating a victory create a sense of success and belonging. Companies do not see parties as of money and allocate budget to support such events; moreover, they often leave good memories. From our own experiences, we all have happy memories of our birthday parties when we were little. Every family has great photos at family gatherings in their album. In addition, contrary to what some people believe that spending on parties is a waste of social resources, they actually create value, either by employing people in the party-planning business or by offering people better experiences.The popularity of parties, however, causes some tension in the society. They are hard on introverted people who find themselves uncomfortable in the crowd. This is a clinic symptom which psychologists call “social anxiety disorder”. There are other ways to celebrate important events that may have greater value for their cost. For instance, companies could send out gifts after successful projects and parents could take their children on family trips to celebrate birthdays.In my opinion, while a party is a form of social event that brings many benefits to individuals and the society, other choices should also be considered, either to cut spending or to relieve the stress of those who are not fond of crowded celebrations.This is a very good essay. Other than minor inaccuracies there are no problems (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). Seems to be worth IELTS Band 8.";The debate about whether spending a significant amount on celebrations such as weddings, birthdays, and other parties is a waste of money or a necessity has sparked intense discussion. On the one hand, some individuals argue that these expenses are frivolous and unnecessary. They believe that the money spent on lavish parties could be better utilized for more practical purposes such as saving for the future, paying off debts, or investing in valuable assets.On the other hand, others contend that these celebrations are essential for both individuals and society. They argue that these events bring people together, foster social bonds, and create lasting memories. For instance, weddings are not only a celebration of the union between two people but also a declaration of their commitment to their families and community. Similarly, birthday parties, especially for children, are a milestone in their development, marking another year of growth and learning. These celebrations also play a significant role in cultural and social heritage, preserving traditions and values that are passed down through generations.In my opinion, the latter perspective holds more weight. While it is true that excessive spending can be wasteful, moderate celebrations can have profound psychological and social benefits. They provide a sense of belonging, strengthen relationships, and offer a much-needed break from the monotony of daily life. Moreover, these events can also boost local economies through the services and products they demand, such as catering, decorations, and entertainment. Therefore, when done thoughtfully and within one's means, spending on celebrations can be seen as a valuable investment in personal and societal well-being, rather than a mere waste of money.
1393;Should the same laws which prohibit the sale and consumption of heroin be applied to tobacco? Discuss.;Recently, a heated debate when a few reputable health organizations suggested the application of a similar act of heroin selling and usage prohibition . In this , I will analyze why the adoption of such a law could be a breakthrough in our youngsters’ safety, according to my vision.Firstly, tobacco does not differ much from heroin when it comes to the addictive effect. , the active ingredient in tobacco, exerts its effect by acting directly on smoker’s brain cells. Numerous experiments carried out by on animals, rats, proved that this toxic chemical does lead time to dependency, similarly to the effect experienced with .Secondly, the restriction on selling would surely show an instant decline in tobacco smoking. ” Having easy access to cigarettes puts a tremendous pressure, especially on teenagers,to resist such a temptation” Dr.Hisham , head of department at Alexandria Medical college , states firmly. “Giving the new generation the sense that the severity of smoking is to other lethal drugs usage be a life saving step, they will thank us for as they get older.” he continues.To recapitulate, applying of a futuristic law such as the suggested one will have a positive impact ,not only on young people’s health but on our society as a whole.;The notion of restricting the sale of tobacco products, as suggested by reputable health organizations, bears a striking resemblance to the prohibition of heroin. By applying a similar act to tobacco, it is likely that the prevalence of smoking would significantly decrease. The restriction on selling tobacco products would undoubtedly lead to an instant decline in tobacco smoking, as the availability and accessibility of these products would be severely limited.This approach is grounded in the understanding that tobacco use is a major public health concern, responsible for millions of deaths worldwide each year. By curtailing the sale of tobacco products, the number of smokers would inevitably decrease, as the ease with which individuals can procure these products would be greatly reduced. Furthermore, the restriction would also serve as a deterrent, discouraging potential smokers from initiating the habit.The parallels between the prohibition of heroin and the proposed restriction on tobacco sales are evident. Both substances are highly addictive and pose significant health risks to users. By treating tobacco with the same severity as heroin, governments can demonstrate their commitment to protecting public health. The instant decline in tobacco smoking would be a direct result of this proactive approach, ultimately saving countless lives and reducing the economic burden of smoking-related illnesses.In conclusion, the application of a similar act to prohibit the sale of tobacco products, as suggested by reputable health organizations, is a viable solution to mitigate the tobacco epidemic. By restricting the sale of these products, governments can effectively reduce the prevalence of smoking, thereby safeguarding public health and promoting a healthier society. This proactive measure would undoubtedly yield positive outcomes, demonstrating the importance of prioritizing public health and well-being.
1394;Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth with poorer nations by providing them with things such as food and education? Or is this the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens?;I think that wealthy nations should be required to share their wealth with poorer nations. at providing such things as food and education because of the three following reasons.Firstly, citizens of both wealthy nations and poorer nations are human beings. Therefore, we can not look at, hear of, or talk about people who lack food, education, without compassion and sympathy. Sharing wealth with poorer nations is not only a good deed but is also a .Secondly, many nations in Africa and Asia are poor. Famine, diseases, crime and illiteracy are killing the citizens of these countries. , many nations in Europe and America are rich. If there are no actions taken, this inequality will increase dramatically. Poor countries will become poorer while rich countries will become richer. As a result, the poorest countries will become slaves of the richest countries. So, sharing wealth is useful way to prevent people from that bad future.Thirdly, although sharing wealth with poorer nations is very necessarythis help should only stop at providing such things as food, medicine and education. Or else, poor nations may become dependent on the aid. They may lose enthusiasm to build their countries by themselves. Moreover, rich nations can take advantage of sharing wealth to interfere with the governance of poor nations’. This can’t be considered a humane action and should be prevented.In my opinion, sharing wealth with poorer nations has both a bad side and a good side. What we have to do is its bad side and its good side.;The disparity in wealth between nations is a pressing global issue. It is imperative that wealthy nations are required to share their wealth with poorer nations, as this is not only a moral obligation, but also a necessary step towards creating a more equitable world. There are several compelling reasons that support this stance.Firstly, citizens of both wealthy nations and poor nations are human beings, deserving of the same basic rights and dignity. Sharing wealth is not only a good deed, but it is also a moral imperative. By providing essential resources such as food and education, the wealthy nations can help alleviate the suffering of millions of people in poorer nations. This is a fundamental aspect of human rights, and it is the responsibility of the global community to ensure that everyone has access to the basic necessities of life.Secondly, many nations in Africa and Asia are plagued by poverty, famine, diseases, crime, and illiteracy. These social ills are killing the citizens of these countries, and it is the duty of the wealthy nations to help mitigate these problems. By sharing their wealth, wealthy nations can provide critical assistance in areas such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure development. This can help to break the cycle of poverty and create opportunities for economic growth and development in poorer nations.In conclusion, it is essential that wealthy nations share their wealth with poorer nations. This is a matter of human rights, moral obligation, and global responsibility. By providing essential resources and assistance, wealthy nations can help to alleviate poverty, reduce social ills, and promote economic development in poorer nations. Ultimately, sharing wealth is a necessary step towards creating a more just and equitable world, where all human beings have the opportunity to thrive and reach their full potential.
1302;Social media has become a real problem for some young people today, and governments should create laws that allow only people over 18 years of age to have accounts.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Social media today is extremely significant to a majority of the population, especially the younger generation. Many teenagers find it exceptionally convenient and necessary for communication and entertainment. However, not everyone is able to use social media responsibly, which gave rise to the idea of making it accessible to only those older than eighteen years of age.Though there are negatives, such as cyber-bullying, or being too distracted by these modern media, there are issues surrounding most things in life. It is a choice to go onto a social media website, and many younger people are capable of managing accounts without any difficulties. It is not the government’s responsibility to monitor under eighteen-year olds; that is for the parents.Statistics show that over eighty per cent of teens use a form of online social media. It allows them to chat online, easily stay in contact with friends and family across the world, and see updates on others’ lives (through text, photos or videos). Social media is a way to express thoughts or ideas and to stay in contact with the rest of the world.To not permit one of the largest Internet-using demographics to use social media because a few people have problems with it is an irrational and an unfair restriction. Not only would profit be lost with fewer users, but controlling who creates accounts and monitoring proof of age would be difficult as well. I believe that laws should not make social media inaccessible to young people under eighteen; this would be unnecessary and absurd.";The advent of social media has revolutionized the way people interact, communicate, and share information. Today, social media platforms have become an integral part of daily life, especially for the younger generation. The significance of social media cannot be overstated, as it has transformed the way people connect,ing with each other, access information, and express themselves. However, the increasing dependence on social media has also raised concerns about its impact on individuals, particularly the younger generation.While social media offers numerous benefits, such as networking opportunities, access to information, and entertainment, not everyone is able to use it responsibly. The lack of maturity and impulse control in younger users can lead to reckless behavior, cyberbullying, and exposure to inappropriate content. This has sparked a debate about the minimum age requirement for social media usage. Some argue that social media should only be accessible to individuals older than eighteen years of age, as they are deemed more mature and capable of using these platforms responsibly.Proponents of this idea believe that restricting social media access to adults would mitigate the risks associated with irresponsible usage, such as online harassment, addiction, and decreased attention span. By setting an age limit, social media companies can ensure that their platforms are used by individuals who are better equipped to navigate the online world, make informed decisions, and avoid potential pitfalls. However, it is also important to consider the benefits of social media for younger users, such as access to educational resources, social connections, and creative expression. Ultimately, finding a balance between responsible social media usage and accessibility is crucial to harnessing the potential of social media while minimizing its risks.
771;Society is based on rules and laws. If individuals were free to do whatever they want to do, it could not function. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?;It is commonly held that society can operate perfectly by a set of rules. It means that providing total freedom to people undoubtedly results in chaos with the further possibility of total collapse. I strongly agree with this point of view as I am in the opinion that rules play a significant role in creating a stable society. In this essay, this idea will be discussed in detail.Basically, a set of rules can be helpful to achieve productive results in such essential areas as medicine and construction. For example, it is necessary to develop common procedures of operations in surgery or traffic rules for public transport. Unless there are not standardized, it might cause a lot of deaths or at least injuries. Constructing also should be based on common processes because comfort and safe accommodation is a necessity for many people. Although there are people who consider rules and laws limiting and imposing, it can be argued that they are critical in the organization of humanity.Laws are not obstacles on the way to people's freedom because they are established to regulate formal relationships when it is difficult to find a compromise informally. Moreover, they are vitally important when people face crime and violence. Without any system of justice solving crimes becomes more challenging. All criminal accidents tend to be out of control and spread around the world immediately. Shoplifting, robbery, and even disastrous wars can plunge our world into darkness. This way humanity might face total chaos where morals values and behavioral patterns are neglected. In this context, the word ‘society’ risks becoming totally meaningless, as its main definition is a 'group of people with common traditions and rules.'From the arguments presented above, one may conclude that any society needs standards, laws, or even moral principles. They form a foundation for safety, a good level of medicine, and science that allows to create a strong society and manage any difficulties or threats that may disturb people’s well-being.;"The establishment of rules and laws is a fundamental aspect of human society, serving as the backbone of organization and productivity. In critical fields such as medicine and construction, a set of rules can be incredibly beneficial in achieving results that are not only efficient but also safe and reliable. For instance, in medicine, strict protocols and guidelines ensure that medical procedures are carried out with precision and care, minimizing the risk of errors and adverse outcomes. Similarly, in construction, adherence to building codes and safety standards is crucial for preventing accidents and ensuring the structural integrity of buildings.Despite the evident benefits of rules and laws, there are those who view them as restrictive and imposing, curtailing individual freedom and creativity. However, this perspective overlooks the essential role that laws play in regulating formal relationships and maintaining social order. Laws are not obstacles to freedom; rather, they are established to provide a framework within which individuals can live and interact without fear of chaos or exploitation. They safeguard rights, protect the vulnerable, and promote a sense of security and stability that is indispensable for personal and collective prosperity.In essence, rules and laws are critical to the organization of humanity, facilitating cooperation, predictability, and progress. They do not limit human potential but instead, provide the necessary structure for individuals and societies to flourish. By establishing clear boundaries and expectations, laws enable people to make informed decisions, plan for the future, and contribute to the common good without the burden of constant uncertainty or conflict. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that rules and laws are not only necessary but also beneficial, contributing to the harmony and advancement of human society."
1398;Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree that this is the right course of action? Give reasons for your opinion.;, organization and companies as well as governments impose restrictions in work places and public amenities. It has become fashionable in the world today . I feel that smoking can be harmful, but I don’t think it should be forbidden completely. I would also argue that people should have the whether or not they should smoke.Allow me to present the three positive sides of smoking. Firstly, smoking certainly helps many people to relax. For some, it even improves concentration. If someone is upset or they have , to smoke to reduce the pressure or tension. people like to smoke when they are relaxing with friends. Secondly, governments throughout the world make huge profits from taxes on cigarettes. The income obtained through taxes provides funds which are used for building and public places such as parks, gardens, sports ground and foot paths. Thirdly, tobacco industry also employs tens of thousands of people all over the world, particularly in poorer countries such as Zimbabwe or the Philippines. Without cigarettes, these people would have no jobs.Despite these positive are lots of negative effects to smoking too. Initially, smoking has been proven to be very dangerous for health. cigarette contains more than 4000 chemical substances, therefore, it dangerous diseases such as heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis or lung cancer. According to a recent report in Britain close to 3,500 people are killed each year in road accidents and 120,000 are killed by smoking. Furthermore, smoking costs governments millions of dollars because of the large number of people who need treatment in hospitals for smoking-related problems. Moreover, passive smoking is also a major concern today. Recent research shows that non-smokers can suffer from health problems if they spend long periods of time among people who do smoke. In the UK children whose parents are are three times as likely to start smoking themselves .In short, I think the world would be a better place without cigarettes. However, the decision of whether smoke or not to smoke should be for each individual to make. I suggest that people should not smoke in a room or a place where there are non smokers, however they should be free to smoke elsewhere.;The Dangers of Smoking: A Threat to Public HealthSmoking is a hazardous habit that poses significant risks to an individual's health and wellbeing. A single cigarette contains more than 4000 chemical substances, many of which are toxic and carcinogenic. As a result, smoking is a leading cause of dangerous diseases such as heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis, and lung cancer. These diseases can have devastating consequences, including premature death and prolonged suffering.The risks associated with smoking are not limited to the individual smoker. In the UK, children whose parents smoke are three times as likely to start smoking themselves. This intergenerational transmission of smoking habits is a major public health concern, as it perpetuates a cycle of addiction and disease. Children who grow up in smoking households are not only more likely to start smoking, but they are also exposed to second-hand smoke, which can cause a range of health problems, including respiratory infections and asthma.The fact that children of smokers are more likely to start smoking themselves highlights the need for urgent action to prevent the uptake of smoking among young people. This can be achieved through education and awareness campaigns, as well as measures to restrict access to tobacco products. Furthermore, parents and caregivers have a critical role to play in setting a positive example and providing a smoke-free environment for their children.In conclusion, the dangers of smoking are well-established, and the risks extend far beyond the individual smoker. The fact that cigarette smoke contains over 4000 toxic substances, and that children of smokers are more likely to start smoking themselves, underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to prevent smoking and protect public health. By working together, we can reduce the burden of smoking-related diseases and create a healthier, smoke-free future for all.
665;Some cities create housing areas by providing taller buildings. Others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. What solution is better?;Some big cities, especially in Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama in Japan tend to build taller buildings like skyscrapers. Other local cities and places where are scarcely populated are built wider. This is quite understandable in terms of space, and there might be some solutions to dissipate populations around Japan.Initially, the main reason why people tend to gather in big cities is that there are many opportunities to get a job. There are famous headquarter companies and branches that are based in foreign countries. Therefore, more and more people move to the big cities so that many taller apartments and buildings are built to let them live in the limited space. There seems to be stressful due to people being densely populated, but infrastructures are well organized, especially transport, medical care, and security.In contrast, the population in the countryside becomes less. Therefore, there is plenty of space to build houses in the wider area. It seems to be well-relaxed and comfortable to live in a slow-paced lifestyle. But, it is apparently more difficult to obtain a new job, and lacking transport, so they need to rely on cars. In addition, the number of hospitals is much smaller than big cities. These issues are long controversial as a first world problem.Finally, as Covid-19 spread worldwide, many people are started to work at home with a lap top computer. Innumerable companies adopted IT systems that are able to work remotely. In addition, some companies had already stated this systemized working style will not change, however, Covid-19 completely ended. This means that many people do not necessarily need to live in big cities. Therefore, if the transport system is well organized, especially establishing and improving a train, which works faster and more frequently. This effort will be not only helpful to dissipate the population outside of the big cities, but also promotive to tackling with great infrastructures to countrysides.In conclusion, as a result, the densely populated cities will be able to reduce its population and increase the population in the countryside. As a result, some issues will be resolved and become well-balanced solutions. Finally, it might be able to build wider houses in big cities with reasonable prices than now.;The urban landscape of Japan is a tale of two extremes. In big cities like Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama, the skylines are dominated by towering skyscrapers that seem to touch the clouds. These metropolises are hubs of economic and cultural activity, and as such, there is a constant demand for space to accommodate businesses, residents, and visitors. As a result, architects and engineers are forced to think vertically, designing and building ever-taller structures to meet the needs of the population.In stark contrast, the countryside of Japan tells a different story. As people flock to the cities in search of employment and entertainment, the population in rural areas is dwindling. This exodus has resulted in a significant decrease in population density, leaving behind vast expanses of open land. The countryside, once bustling with activity, is now characterized by rolling hills, empty fields, and a sense of tranquility.One of the benefits of this demographic shift is the abundance of space available for building houses in the wider area. Unlike the cramped and densely populated cities, the countryside offers a chance to build spacious homes with ample room for gardens, yards, and other outdoor amenities. This is a major draw for those looking to escape the hustle and bustle of city life and seeking a more peaceful and relaxed pace. Additionally, the availability of land in the countryside also presents opportunities for innovative and sustainable building projects, such as eco-friendly homes and community developments. Overall, the contrast between Japan's bustling cities and its expansive countryside presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities for architects, planners, and residents alike.
11;Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Athletes to be on the top need to have high-end facilities that a country can provide for them to be able to improve their strengths and skills. Some government opted to build facilities exclusively for training athletes for international sports goals, instead of building establishments for everyone to have the liberty of using the sports facilities. From my perspective, this phenomena is a negative development.Being able to discover an individual's potential, they need to have a support from any form of sources. Establishing sports facilities can help people to discover their own interests, talents and even skills in learning new things. Centers which offer utilities, equipments and state-of-the-art tools that provide learning sports can be a great advantage to people who want to train themselves on the things that can awaken their interests when it comes to sports.In addition, building these kind of establishments, not only for the purpose to train top athletes, but also for people to immerse themselves to different variaties of activities can help them socialize more with their peers. This is extremely beneficial that aside from doing sports that they are into, they get to play along with peers, discover one's potential and also learning from one another. Furthermore, these individuals can also have the future to be one of top athletes that a country can have.In conclusion, although there are countries that chose to have their sports establishments exclusively for training top athletes, I assert that these that actions can be lead to negative feedbacks. Government should allow everyone the privilege to use and avail facilities that can hone an individual's talents, skills and dexterity when it comes to sports and this can also be immensely benefical for both country and citizen alike.;The pursuit of excellence in sports is a highly competitive and demanding endeavor. For athletes to reach the pinnacle of their careers, they require access to high-end facilities that can provide them with the necessary tools and resources to hone their strengths and skills. In recognition of this need, some governments have opted to invest in building state-of-the-art facilities exclusively for the training of athletes with international sports aspirations.These specialized facilities are designed to cater to the specific needs of elite athletes, providing them with advanced equipment, cutting-edge technology, and expert coaching. By doing so, governments can give their athletes a competitive edge on the international stage, enabling them to compete with the best from around the world. The rationale behind this approach is that by focusing resources on a select group of high-potential athletes, a country can increase its chances of achieving success in international competitions, thereby boosting national pride and prestige.However, this approach has also raised questions about the distribution of resources and the accessibility of sports facilities for the general public. Critics argue that governments should prioritize building facilities that are open to everyone, allowing people of all ages and skill levels to engage in physical activity and promote a culture of health and wellness. Nevertheless, for a country to produce world-class athletes, it is essential to have facilities that can support their development and training. By providing elite athletes with world-class facilities, governments can demonstrate their commitment to achieving excellence in sports, and potentially reap the rewards of international success. Ultimately, the decision to build exclusive facilities for athletes is a strategic one, driven by the desire to succeed on the global sports stage.
725;Some educationalists say that every child should be taught how to play a musical instrument. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;It is commonly known that music has always played an important role in upbringing of children and a lot of parents wish their kids play a musical instrument. However, I disagree that this skill is essential to every pupil.First of all, not all people are born with a talent for music, which is essential if one wants to learn how to play it. Some people are natural musicians and succeed in this sphere with ease. On the other hand, there are children for whom learning to play is a hard work and, eventually, they might start hating music instead of enjoying it. Some people are bound to become excellent engineers or doctors and for them learning to read and play music is just a waste of time.Another important factor is that all kids are different and for that reason each of them desires to have a different hobby. If all pupils spent time on music, those who are not interested in it would have less time on things that are really exciting for them. Undoubtedly, everybody has a right to spend their free time in the way they want.What is more, playing a musical instrument is not considered to be an essential skill for a successful career. More time should be devoted to more important subjects, such as Math, Science and Languages. These have more chance to be useful for people when they grow up and graduate from school.To sum up, teaching all children to play an instrument wouldn't be a good idea. It should be taught only to those who really want it as not only would it ditract a child from subjects and hobbies which are more important in their opinion, but also it cannot be mastered by everybody.;The notion that playing a musical instrument is a vital skill for a well-rounded individual has been debated for years. While some argue that music education is essential, others believe that it is a luxury that not everyone can afford. In reality, not all people are born with a talent for music, which is essential if one wants to learn how to play it. Without a natural inclination towards music, the learning process can be frustrating and unproductive.Furthermore, playing a musical instrument is not considered to be an essential skill for a successful career. Unlike subjects such as Math, Science, and Languages, music is not a fundamental requirement for most professions. In today's competitive job market, it is crucial to prioritize subjects that are directly relevant to one's career goals. Devoting too much time to music education can divert attention away from more critical areas of study.In light of this, it is reasonable to suggest that more time should be devoted to more important subjects, such as Math, Science, and Languages. These subjects provide a solid foundation for a wide range of careers and are essential for advancing in today's technology-driven world. By focusing on these core subjects, students can develop a strong foundation for future success. While music education can be a valuable enrichment activity, it should not take precedence over more practical and essential subjects. Ultimately, it is essential to strike a balance between music education and more critical areas of study, ensuring that students are well-prepared for their future careers.
73;Some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The thought of some experts, is that people from rich countries are not satisfied by an ipotetical increase in their economy. In this essay I will discuss this point of view and I will explain why I am not sure I agree with that.It is generally believed by some professional figures, that additionals rise in economic wealth are not so crucial for a rich coutry. People from countries sush as Japan, the U.S.A, Switzerland or Cina are aware of their wide economic power and these governments offer a lot of benefits for their citizens. Thus, people have yet what they want, such as fundings for projects, well-organized cities, a lot of job opportunities. In fact, they do not fell a significant sense of satisfaction in the increase of their economy.Made this point, it is also true that some surveys used by The Italian University of Parma, reveal that citizens from coutries which a strong economy, are really grateful and satisfied by any additional rise, in the economic sector. As consequence due to this increase, they can ask more fundings for some start up or to improve the technology equipment in schools. Personally, I tend to think as a matter of fact that this is the right view. Because it is logical that more money mean more opportunities in any sector of the country. Hospitals, schools, museum and even historical buildings can have the possibility to obteind a lot of benefits.To conclude, in this essay I discuss the generel view of some experts about people from rich countries. I also explained why I strongly disagree with them.;The notion that an increase in economy does not necessarily lead to greater satisfaction among individuals from rich countries is a perspective held by some experts. According to this viewpoint, even if the economy of a wealthy nation experiences significant growth, the citizens of that country will not feel a corresponding increase in satisfaction. This idea suggests that once basic needs are met, the relationship between economic growth and personal satisfaction becomes less straightforward.While this perspective is thought-provoking, it is not entirely convincing. On one hand, it is plausible that after a certain threshold of economic prosperity is reached, the marginal utility of additional wealth diminishes. People may start to pursue goals and desires that are not directly related to material wealth, such as personal fulfillment, social connections, or a sense of purpose. In such cases, economic growth might not directly translate to increased satisfaction.On the other hand, there are several reasons why I am not entirely sure I agree with this viewpoint. Firstly, economic growth often leads to improvements in public services, infrastructure, and overall quality of life, which can enhance satisfaction. Secondly, the security and opportunities provided by a strong economy can reduce stress and anxiety related to financial instability, potentially increasing overall well-being. Lastly, it is challenging to generalize this perspective across all individuals within a rich country, as personal values, aspirations, and circumstances vary widely.In conclusion, while the idea that economic growth in rich countries may not lead to greater satisfaction among its citizens presents an interesting critique of the pursuit of economic growth as a sole measure of success, it is a complex issue with multiple facets. The relationship between economic prosperity and personal satisfaction is influenced by a myriad of factors, including individual priorities, societal values, and the nature of economic growth itself. Therefore, it remains unclear whether economic increases will necessarily lead to greater satisfaction, underscoring the need for a more nuanced understanding of what contributes to human well-being beyond mere economic metrics.
1061;Some museums and art galleries charge admission fees, while others have free entry.Do you think the advantages of charging for admission outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many artistic places prefer to have an entry fee, whereas others let free access. I fully think that the benefits to have admission fees compensate the drawbacks to be not free.Many individuals would visit museum or art galleries if it were free which could attract more tourists. Unfortunately, admission charge decreases the possibility to discover paintings or masterpieces. However, before being a cultural place, art galleries are a place where numerous employees work. Indeed, if visitors had not to purchase the entrance, workforce would be not paid and the place would be not clean as museum should be. Moreover, huge museums as the British Museum have some sponsors to restore masterpieces whereas small museums have sometimes not the fundings and hence, admission fees would help it. Then, having an entry fee limit the number of individuals who do not really want to see art and appreciate the place.Concerning to cultural places, museum and art galleries know that many households could not afford ticket entrances for their offspring so many museums establish reduced price for teenagers and children. This project improves the relation between young people and the culture, then it allows children to be attracted to culture, partipate to the technical expenses behind the entry fee and after to visit again some cultural places when they will grow up and purchase the full price. Moreover, purchasing tickets help to the economy of the country which sometimes famous cultural places are a significant part of country's income. For instance, admission fees in museum are two third of the tourism's outcome in France.To conclude, I believe that admission fees should outweigh free entrance because it does not let the worth process of museum to work. Even if sometimes admission fees are costly for us, there is always a meaning behind the prices.;The world of art is a vast and wondrous place, filled with masterpieces and creative expressions that have the power to inspire and educate. However, many artistic places, such as museums and art galleries, have opted to charge an entry fee, limiting access to these incredible resources. On the other hand, some institutions have chosen to provide free access, allowing anyone to wander through their halls and discover the beauty within.It is undeniable that many individuals would visit museums or art galleries if they were free. The absence of an admission charge would make these cultural treasures more accessible to people from all walks of life, regardless of their financial situation. Unfortunately, the reality is that many artistic places rely on entry fees as a source of income, which can deter potential visitors. As a result, the possibility of discovering paintings or masterpieces is decreased, and the opportunity for people to experience and learn from these works of art is limited.The implementation of entry fees can have a profound impact on the number of visitors to artistic places. Many people, especially students, low-income families, and individuals from marginalized communities, may be discouraged from visiting museums or art galleries due to the cost. This not only affects the individual's access to art and culture but also limits the institution's ability to share its collection with a broader audience. By providing free access, artistic places can foster a greater appreciation and understanding of art, promote cultural exchange, and inspire creativity in people of all ages and backgrounds. Ultimately, making art accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial situation, is essential to promoting a culturally rich and inclusive society.
1355;Some parents encourage young people to leave home while others think they should stay with the family, discuss and give your opinion;Many parents encourage young people to leave home when they become older, while others think they should stay at home with the family. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.With the tremendous influence of modernisation, remarkable changes have taken place in the family structure to such an extent that nowadays, youngsters are motivated by their parents to live alone as they grow up. However, some people are of the view that it is more practical for a youngster to live with their family.On the one hand, there are many positive aspects to youths living away from their parents at young age. This provides the opportunity to young people to live a life on their own terms and make any decisions without the interference of their parents. Besides, living alone not only makes them independent but also makes them self-reliant, which is a crucial life skill to their successful career. For instance, managing all the house chores such as cleaning, paying bills, cooking and so on will make them well experienced at learning and managing diverse activities and will also boost their confidence.On the other hand, there is no denying the fact that youngsters living away from their family may find themselves in circumstances that may adversely affect their life. Naïve and inexperienced young people in the absence of parental supervision are more likely to fall prey to bad influence and dangerous activities, such as drugs or alcohol consumption, which may jeopardise their career or lead them astray from moral values. However, this situation is less likely to take place with youngsters still living with their parents. Besides, emotional bonding and family relationships can be maintained better if everyone is living together under one roof.In my opinion, although encouraging youngsters to live alone may lead them to learn various life skills, negative aspects and risks associated with living alone can far outweigh the benefits.This response covers the task topic well, by discussing the positive and negative aspects of living alone as a young adult, and the writer’s opinion has also been included. Paragraphing helps to present ideas in an orderly way, and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay. There is some repetitive use of the word ‘make’ in the first body paragraph, which could have been avoided. Apart from that, the writer’s vocabulary seems to be quite rich and allows them to communicate ideas precisely and clearly. Overall, this essay seems to be worthy of IELTS Band 8.;The debate about when young people should leave their family home has sparked a heated discussion among parents and society as a whole. While some parents encourage their children to leave home when they become older, others believe that they should stay at home with the family. In this essay, I will discuss both views and provide my own opinion on the matter.On the one hand, there are many positive aspects to youths living away from their parents at a young age. Living alone not only makes them independent but also makes them self-reliant, which is a crucial life skill for their successful career. By living away from home, young people can develop important life skills such as time management, budgeting, and decision-making. This, in turn, can help them become more confident and self-assured individuals. Furthermore, living away from home can also provide young people with the opportunity to experience new cultures, meet new people, and develop a broader perspective on life.On the other hand, some parents believe that their children should stay at home with the family. They argue that emotional bonding and family relationships can be maintained better if everyone is living together under one roof. This can be especially beneficial for young people who are still in their teenage years or early twenties, as they can receive guidance and support from their parents during a critical period of their development. Additionally, living at home can also be more cost-effective and allow young people to save money on living expenses.In my opinion, I believe that young people should be given the option to leave home when they become older, but it ultimately depends on the individual's maturity level and readiness for independence. While living away from home can provide many benefits, it is also important for young people to maintain strong family relationships and receive support from their loved ones. Ultimately, a balance between independence and family bonding is essential for the healthy development of young people.
1335;Some people believe that excessive use of modern technologies, such as computers and smartphones, is negatively affecting the reading and writing skills of our young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Parents and teachers in many countries are feeling increasingly concerned about the effect of digital devices on vital skills of school-aged children. They are alarmed by the declining ability of young people to read and write and its suspected link to the influence of modern technology, and I wholeheartedly share their view. This essay will outline the reasons to watch out for the consequences of widespread use of computers and mobile phones by our youngsters.Primary school is a very important period when children develop their fine motor skills, which are involved in learning to write. Time spent typing on a mobile phone or a tablet doesn’t contribute to the necessary workout of the small muscles in the hands and fingers of young people. Not only do they get less practice in writing but also fewer opportunities to train in spelling words, since the ‘autocorrect’ and ‘autocomplete’ features use the first few letters to guess the entire word, therefore making it unnecessary for the child to remember and type it correctly. Another companion of unrestrained use of mobile devices is the jargon that is often used in text messages, where words are shortened or distorted. Exposure to ‘texting’ tends to replace the correct words with abbreviations in young minds, causing their spelling accuracy to decline.Reading is another casualty of unrestricted access to smart devices. Video content can be more appealing and immersive for kids and they often are automatically drawn to it instead of books. Reading requires regular practice and needs to become a habit in order to fully develop as a skill; however, it is being perceived as a boring and labourious activity by many youngsters compared to effortless video-watching. Easy and instant access to videos and movies pushes books further down the list of preferences of young audience, and it takes a significant commitment from parents and teachers to ensure that children continue to read books.To sum up, modern technology can be a friend or a foe for young children, depending on the choices adults in their lives make, regulating the amount of screen time and its purpose. Without due care the writing and reading abilities of kids can be harmed by other, more enjoyable activities they can use the devices for.";The widespread use of digital devices among school-aged children has sparked concern among parents and teachers about the impact on vital skills. Excessive screen time and the constant typing on mobile phones or tablets have led to a decline in the development of essential motor skills. Specifically, the small muscles in the hands and fingers of young people are not receiving the necessary workout, as they are not engaging in activities that promote fine motor skills, such as writing, drawing, or crafting.As a result, the dexterity and coordination of children's hands are not being fully developed, which can have long-term consequences on their ability to perform everyday tasks. Furthermore, the over-reliance on digital devices is also affecting another crucial skill: reading. The unrestricted access to smart devices has led to a decline in reading habits among children, as they are more inclined to spend their time scrolling through screens rather than turning pages. Reading is an essential skill that not only improves vocabulary and comprehension but also fosters imagination, creativity, and critical thinking.The lack of reading practice can have severe consequences on a child's academic performance and overall cognitive development. Parents and teachers must take a proactive approach to mitigate the effects of digital devices on children's skills. By setting limits on screen time, encouraging physical activities that promote fine motor skills, and fostering a love for reading, adults can help children develop the essential skills they need to succeed in school and beyond. It is crucial to strike a balance between the benefits of technology and the need for children to engage in activities that promote physical, cognitive, and emotional development. By doing so, we can ensure that children develop into well-rounded, skilled, and educated individuals.
379;Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;This essay agrees on the need of that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities, but always under one premise: those students should have demonstrated their capability to comply with university studies successfully.There are countries, for example Scandinavian countries, where their government helps students by giving them specific students' loans. These loans have special characteristics such as long loan terms and low interest rates. It is not for free, but at least a higher number of students can have access to upgrade their studies.And in many other European countries university fees are not large, so most of the students can access to bachelor studies. What it's not easy is having the needed qualification you need to access to the specific university study you want.If we talk in worlwide terms, university studies are limited to wealthy people.In fact I read only a couple of weeks ago that only a 17% of worlds' population have university studies. There is a contradiction between developped and non developped countries. As an example, in most countries in Europe we have too many university students. Actually they cannot find a job easily at their own country and sometimes they emigrate to another country in Europe or outside Europe. Furthermore vocational workers such as plumbers, waiters or receptionists can't be found, there no unemployment in vocational work!.The opposite happens in non developped countries. As university studies have large fees, almost nobody can access to them, and vocational workers suffer unemployment, so they need to emigrate to other countries to find jobs.To summarize, I believe fees should not be an obstacle to study in a university. The obstable should be your previous califications.Education and Health, as much as a country can hold them, should be available for all population, poor and wealthy, with non differentiation.;The issue of university tuition fees has been a longstanding debate worldwide. Many argue that governments should bear the financial burden of university education, but with a crucial condition: students must demonstrate their capability to succeed in university studies. This condition is essential to ensure that government funding is allocated efficiently and effectively.In today's world, university education is often limited to those from affluent backgrounds. The high cost of tuition fees creates a significant barrier for talented students from low-income families, preventing them from pursuing higher education. This not only hinders their personal growth but also deprives society of their potential contributions. By covering full course fees for capable students, governments can help bridge the gap between socio-economic classes and foster a more merit-based system.To qualify for government-funded university education, students should undergo a rigorous selection process that assesses their academic prowess, intellectual curiosity, and dedication to learning. This could include entrance exams, interviews, and evaluations of their past academic performance. By setting this condition, it ensures that government funds are invested in students who are likely to excel in university studies, thereby maximizing the return on investment.Furthermore, governments can reap long-term benefits from investing in the education of capable students. A well-educated workforce can drive innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth, ultimately leading to increased tax revenues and a more prosperous society. In conclusion, governments should pay full course fees for university students who demonstrate their capability to succeed, as this can help create a more equitable and productive society. By doing so, we can unlock the potential of talented individuals from all walks of life and foster a brighter future for generations to come.
1428;Some people believe that having a pet such as a cat or a dog helps old people to live a more enjoyable life and to stay healthier. How do you think old people benefit from having a pet? Do you think there are any problems related to old people who have pets?;, and indeed, the importance of relationship between human beings and their pets has been proved to be slightly exaggerated in some nations. However, although problems regarding may affect the health conditions of old people, the benefits that these lovely animals bring to them, physically and mentally alike, are clearly undeniable.In of physical benefits, the well-being of elderly people with pets compared to those without pets, since not only do they have to take care of themselves, the responsibility ensure their one fed and well looked after encourages them to become even more active. Due to these extra activities, this might not have an obvious influence on their health, but at least this could help them to avoid bad . Coupled with physical side, their mental wellbeing will also be improved, and the reason is that having someone to take care of would reduce the chance of feeling . Therefore, their could be minimised.In spite of the above advantages, the interaction between pets and vulnerable old people still exist. One of the major concerns is the of these animal on their tracheas, especially those asthma. virtually invisible in the air, many asthma symptoms are caused unconsciously by pets. In addition to the fact that old people might experience difficulty in looking after their pets, as their health conditions are limited, could become even more when they try take care of others.In conclusion, it is true that obstacles still exist for elderly people in adopting pets, but the benefits of this topic its . For such reasons, instead of , further support would be far more beneficial.;The relationship between pets and their owners, particularly vulnerable older adults, is a complex one. On one hand, the benefits that these lovely animals bring to them, physically and mentally alike, are clearly undeniable. Interacting with pets has been shown to reduce stress, lower blood pressure, and even alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety. For many elderly individuals, pets provide companionship, a sense of purpose, and unconditional love, which can be especially valuable in later life.However, in spite of the above advantages, the interaction between pets and vulnerable old people still poses some significant concerns. One of the major concerns is the impact of these animals on their owners' respiratory health, especially those with asthma. The dander, or skin cells, shed by pets can become virtually invisible in the air, triggering allergic reactions and exacerbating asthma symptoms. Many asthma symptoms are caused unconsciously by pets, as the tiny particles can be inhaled without the owner even realizing it.For older adults with pre-existing respiratory conditions, the presence of pets can be a double-edged sword. While the emotional benefits of pet ownership are clear, the physical risks associated with pet dander and asthma attacks cannot be ignored. It is essential for vulnerable older adults to weigh these risks and benefits carefully, and consider steps to mitigate the negative effects, such as frequent cleaning and grooming of pets, or using air purifiers to reduce dander particles in the air. By taking these precautions, older adults can continue to enjoy the companionship and love of their pets, while also protecting their physical health.
1300;Some people believe that homework should not be given to school children. Others, however, say that homework is an important requirement for children to be able to develop appropriately. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The benefits of giving or not giving homework to children are often debated. Some people feel that children have enough work to do during one day whilst at school, whereas others feel that the more work set, the better.It is true that schools today place more and more demands and pressure on children. The competition to do well, to enter a good university and to get a good job is significant. This has led to the ideology that children should do as much schoolwork as possible in order to help their intellectual development. The argument, however, that more is better is not always valid. There comes a point, especially for a child, when more knowledge cannot be absorbed in a day. When a child has possibly 7 or 8 classes a day on different subjects, he or she is processing a lot of information already. To give more work to be done at home, therefore, would be pointless and even counterproductive. In addition to this, although it is important to be educated, childhood should also be a time when there is an opportunity to just play and enjoy unstructured time. Homework can significantly lessen the possibilities of doing this.On the other hand, it can be argued that there is a place for homework. If study at school is not overdone, the opportunity to look at work again and extend ideas can be an invaluable exercise. It’s easy to forget one thing that has been taught once, but if that concept is revisited a second time, the brain has time to reprocess and likely better understand and remember.It seems to me that there is a place for homework for today’s children. What must be remembered, though, is that homework needs to be limited to age-appropriate parameters, so that a balance can be struck between study and free time and relaxation.;The debate over homework has been a longstanding one, with some people advocating for a substantial amount of homework to be assigned to children, while others believe that the school day provides enough academic work. In reality, children already have a significant workload during the school day, and assigning excessive homework can be counterproductive. There comes a point, especially for a child, when more knowledge cannot be absorbed in a day, and assigning too much homework can lead to mental fatigue and a decreased desire to learn.Homework is intended to reinforce concepts learned in the classroom and help students develop essential skills such as time management, organization, and critical thinking. However, when homework is excessive, it can have the opposite effect, leading to frustration, stress, and a negative attitude towards learning. Moreover, an overabundance of homework can also limit a child's ability to engage in other activities that are essential for their development, such as sports, music, or spending time with family and friends.It is essential, therefore, that homework is limited to age-appropriate parameters. This means that the amount and type of homework assigned should be tailored to the individual needs and abilities of each child. For younger children, homework should be minimal and focused on reinforcing basic skills, while older children can be assigned more complex tasks that challenge them to think critically and solve problems. By setting realistic and achievable homework expectations, teachers can help children develop a love of learning, rather than a dread of homework. Ultimately, striking a balance between academic work and other aspects of a child's life is crucial for their overall development and well-being.
1369;Some people believe that preserving natural environment is crucial, but make no effort to do so (reasons and solutions);Some people believe that preserving natural environment is crucial, however, most make no effort to do so. Why do you think this is happening? What are some simple actions that could help the environment?It is commonly believed that preservation of natural resources is imperative, yet most people seem to exert no effort in doing so. Understanding the causes of this negligent attitude may help with devising some simple measures to safeguard the deteriorating environment.Lack of awareness is probably the foremost reason why the vast majority of individuals appears to be unmindful of the current environmental issues. Normally, people have tendency to downplay abstract problems, or those to happen in the distant future. This is because they are not properly informed of the possible detrimental effects of taking the environment for granted. To illustrate, residents in urban areas often deliberately dump their into the nearby creeks and drainage canals causing them to become clogged. It is only when devastating floods strike, that they come to realize the consequences of their actions.Some basic solutions that could be carried out are extensive awareness through all forms of communication and strict implementation of waste management. In addition to the traditional press, social media is a powerful means of disseminating information regarding the impending disasters and their potential hazards. This is a good way of persuading the public to actively take part in the campaign. Another straightforward solution, and by far the least anyone can do to help save the nature is disposing of garbage thoughtfully. Apart from avoiding throwing trash anywhere, everyone should practice proper segregation of biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and recyclable wastes at all times. These actions, when coordinated by the local governments, can be tremendously successful.In conclusion, while individual awareness is key to maintaining a healthy ecosystem, concerted efforts of governments and are much more effective in achieving such goal.The response is well written, it contains reasons, solutions and fully addresses the task. The ideas aren’t repeated, they are conveyed in a clear and easy to understand manner and organised well with sufficient use of cohesive devices. The vocabulary is varied, sentence structures are complex and instances of incorrect grammar are hardly noticeable. Overall, this essay is likely to achieve Band 8 in IELTS.;The preservation of the natural environment is a topic of paramount importance, with many individuals acknowledging its significance. However, it is ironic that despite this awareness, most people fail to take concrete actions to protect the environment. In my opinion, the primary reason for this discrepancy is the lack of awareness about the severity and immediacy of environmental issues. Many people are unaware of the devastating impact of their daily actions on the environment, and as a result, they do not feel compelled to make changes to their behavior.Furthermore, the lack of awareness is often compounded by a sense of powerlessness, with individuals feeling that their actions will have little impact on the larger environmental landscape. However, this could not be further from the truth. Simple actions, such as reducing energy consumption, using public transport, and recycling, can collectively make a significant difference. For instance, using reusable bags and water bottles, and avoiding single-use plastics can significantly reduce waste and minimize harm to marine life.Additionally, making conscious choices about the products we buy, such as choosing sustainable and locally sourced options, can also have a positive impact on the environment. Moreover, supporting organizations that work towards environmental conservation and sustainability can also contribute to the preservation of the natural environment. In conclusion, the preservation of the natural environment requires a collective effort, and it is essential that we take small but significant steps towards creating a more sustainable future. By increasing awareness and taking simple actions, we can make a tangible difference and work towards mitigating the environmental challenges that we face today.
1322;Some people believe that the best way to solve environmental problems is to increase the price of fuel.Do you agree or disagree?;"Raising the price of car fuel is believed by some people to be an excellent method to solve the growing number of environmental issues. However, I strongly disagree with this idea, as doing so would make life difficult for lower-income households. While making fuel more expensive wouldn’t change the habits of wealthy families, switching to fossil fuel alternatives could prove to be much more beneficial for the environment.The most compelling reason against raising the cost of fuel is that the upper classes of society will hardly be affected by rising fuel costs, as this only makes up a minor proportion of their expenditure. They will continue to use their personal vehicles as they wish without a thought for the environment or the higher fuel prices, even if their country has state-of-the-art public transportation.Those who will feel the crunch of this decision are the middle-class and lower-income households, since travelling is a major part of most people’s routine, be it to work, school or shopping. Driving is almost unavoidable in many instances; therefore, raising the price of petrol would only serve to widen the gap between the rich and poor, and serve as an inadvertent form of discrimination.Another reason why increasing the cost of fuel is far from the best way to deal with environmental pollution is that now there are much more viable alternatives. Due to the rapid advances in technology, scientists and engineers have been able to develop several alternatives to fossil fuel, such as cars powered by electricity or naturally produced biofuel. The move to adopt clean energy sources instead of fossil fuels is a much more promising alternative compared to simply making fuel more expensive.In conclusion, I believe that governments of the world should invest more time and money in finding alternatives to fossil fuels that are more environmentally friendly, rather than simply raising the cost of petrol.";The notion that raising the price of petrol is an effective solution to the growing number of environmental issues has gained significant attention in recent years. Proponents of this idea argue that increasing the cost of petrol would reduce consumption, thereby decreasing pollution and mitigating the harmful effects of climate change. However, I strongly disagree with this approach, as it would disproportionately affect lower-income households, who rely heavily on petrol for their daily commutes and survival.Raising the price of petrol would lead to a significant increase in the cost of living for these families, making it difficult for them to make ends meet. Many low-income households already struggle to afford basic necessities, and a surge in petrol prices would only exacerbate their financial burdens. This approach would essentially penalize those who are already vulnerable, rather than encouraging sustainable behavior.Instead, I believe that governments around the world should invest more time and money in finding alternatives to fossil fuels that are more environmentally friendly. This could include investing in renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydrogen power, as well as developing more efficient and sustainable transportation systems. By providing viable alternatives to petrol, governments can encourage individuals to make environmentally conscious choices without placing an undue burden on low-income households.Ultimately, raising the price of petrol is a simplistic solution that fails to address the complexities of environmental degradation. A more nuanced approach, one that prioritizes sustainability and social equity, is needed to effectively mitigate the environmental challenges we face. By investing in alternative energy sources and promoting sustainable practices, we can create a more environmentally friendly and equitable future for all.
1273;Some people believe that we cannot learn anything from the past for our life today, while others believe that history is a valuable source of information to understand human's life.Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is true that these days people say there is little we can gain from previous history, whereas others think that history is a key source to understand our lives. Although there are some strong arguments against learning history, I agree with learning history to know life of human.There are two reasons why people think there is nothing to gain from history. Firstly, there is evidence to support the idea that learning history stresses people out. Based on a survey conducted by Standford University, 57 percent of people consider learning past life of humans a primary source of stress, while less than 6 percent of people said studying previous humans' life was not a stressor. Secondly, people may not have time to remember historical events because the constant stimulation and hustle and bustle of society is holding them back from their life. In turn, they are more likely to regard learning history as useless.Despite the negative drawbacks, I support that historical event is great information to comprehend human's life. The main benefit of a historical event is that it can have a positive impact on people, especially children, as they grow up. Since history has more connection and support to our lives, it allows children to become more insightful and knowledgeable and discover advanced perspectives. For example, I have been widening my perspective through historical events in my family or country because gaining history regarding my family and nation taught me the right attitude to understand today. However, if I did not know any history, I would not have had an opportunity to understand human life and self-development. So, learning history should be encouraged.In conclusion, while I recognize the possible disadvantages of learning history, I believe that the benefits of gaining past events far outweigh them in the long term.;The relevance of history in understanding our lives has been a topic of debate for a long time. While some people argue that there is little to be gained from studying past events, others believe that history is a vital source of knowledge that helps us comprehend our lives. Despite the drawbacks, I firmly believe that historical events provide invaluable information that enables us to gain insight into human life.Studying history allows children to become more knowledgeable and insightful, as they learn from the experiences of previous generations. By examining past events, they can develop a deeper understanding of the complexities of human nature, the consequences of actions, and the evolution of societies. History provides a unique perspective on the present, enabling us to learn from the successes and failures of those who came before us. Moreover, it allows us to discover advanced perspectives on various aspects of life, including politics, culture, and social norms.Furthermore, history has a profound impact on shaping our identities, values, and beliefs. By understanding our heritage and the struggles of our ancestors, we can develop a sense of pride, responsibility, and belonging. History also serves as a warning, highlighting the mistakes of the past and encouraging us to make informed decisions that avoid similar pitfalls. In addition, it fosters critical thinking, analytical skills, and empathy, essential qualities for navigating the complexities of modern life.In conclusion, historical events are a rich source of information that can greatly enhance our understanding of human life. By studying history, we can gain valuable insights, develop critical thinking, and become more informed and responsible individuals. As such, I strongly believe that history is an essential component of our education, enabling us to learn from the past, appreciate the present, and shape a better future.
1342;Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military, while others disagree (opinion);Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military. Others think that women are less suitable for this kind of job. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Sample EssayIn recent years gender equality in employment has been the topic of heated debate. While some may argue that women are less suited for certain jobs such as with the police or the military, I believe that female candidates should be treated the same as their male counterparts.Those who consider women to be unsuited for some kinds of jobs including the police or the military often hold that opinion because such jobs are extremely physically demanding. As the female body has smaller muscles and less physical strength compared to male body, women may have difficulty engaging in strenuous activity which can be exhausting even for men. In military service, female soldiers are more likely to struggle while defending themselves than their male peers when they are forced to move around carrying heavy firearms in the battle, which can increase their risk of mission failure. Because of the hazards and extreme conditions they may encounter, some people advocate that women are not suitable for work in these fields.Nevertheless, I believe that female applicants should be considered for police or military placements without a gender bias, because women are more suited to certain tasks. In the police service, female officers can perform important roles on some occasions such as a body search where male officers are restricted from touching female convicts. In the military service, female nursing staff are more likely to care better for injured soldiers since maternal instinct makes them dedicated and heart-warming professionals. Furthermore, for the sake of fairness to all, job seekers should have an equal opportunity to choose their jobs freely, regardless of gender. Many women have the desire to work in the police and the military and some of them have relevant expertise and qualifications. Therefore, they should not be discriminated against in employment opportunities for these jobs.In conclusion, although some say that women are incompatible with police and military duties because of the high physical demands, I believe that they should be treated as equal to men. This is because there are certain roles with the police and the military that are more suitable for women than men, and therefore both genders should have equal employment opportunities.;The debate surrounding the suitability of women for jobs in the police and military has sparked intense discussion. On one hand, some people believe that women should be treated as equals to men when applying for these positions, arguing that they possess the same capabilities and strengths as their male counterparts. This perspective emphasizes the importance of gender equality and challenges traditional stereotypes that have historically excluded women from these roles. By allowing women to serve in the police and military, they bring unique skills and perspectives that can enhance the effectiveness of these institutions.On the other hand, there are those who think that women are less suitable for these jobs, citing physical demands and the potential risks involved. They argue that the physical requirements of these roles may be too strenuous for women, and that they may be more vulnerable in high-risk situations. However, this view overlooks the fact that women have proven themselves capable of performing these duties with equal proficiency to men, and that physical strength is not the only determining factor in these roles.In my opinion, women should be treated as equals when applying for jobs in the police and military. Not only is it a matter of fairness and equality, but it also acknowledges the valuable contributions that women can make to these institutions. With proper training and equipment, women can perform their duties safely and effectively, and their participation can bring a more diverse and nuanced approach to law enforcement and military operations. Ultimately, it is essential to recognize and challenge outdated stereotypes and biases that have limited women's opportunities in these fields, and to provide them with the same opportunities as men to serve and contribute to the safety and security of their countries.
1376;Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research (discuss);Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research for the benefit of human beings, while others argue that it is wrong. Discuss both views and give your opinion.People have different views on how medical research should be conducted and tested. Although many people support the use of for developing medicines, I personally believe that animal testing is morally wrong.The main reason why some people value to conduct medical research is because animal testing has contributed to many life-saving cures and treatments. It is true that nearly every medical breakthrough in the last 100 years has resulted directly from research using animals. For example, experiments in which dogs had their pancreases removed led directly to the discovery of insulin, critical to saving the lives of diabetics. Furthermore, it is impossible to release to the market before proving it no harm to humans and laboratory mice are appropriate research subjects because they are similar to human beings in many ways.However, I people who consider medical development that involved the use of animals cruel and unacceptable. I believe that the lives of all creatures should be respected and we, humans, have no right to for our own benefits. Governments should invest in developing alternative methods that can replace when doing medical research. For example, a software program can be developed to model a human immune system and new drugs can be tested on the software rather than animals. In this way, no animals will suffer from the medical tests and the society can still benefit from medical development.In conclusion, although it is undoubtedly true that animal testing has helped scientists in drug developments and medical discoveries, I believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused to animals and we should use alternative methods when doing medical research that do not involve animals suffering.This is a great essay. It addresses the two sides of the argument by exploring reasons why animals should and should not be used in medical research. The ideas are well explained and supported by examples. The use of paragraphing is efficient and helps with logical sequencing of ideas. Linking words are used appropriately to achieve the necessary cohesion. Author’s meaning is skillfully conveyed by the use of wide range of vocabulary. Even though there are some inaccurately used expressions, they don’t hinder understanding. Most sentences are error-free, instances of faulty grammar are rare. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;The use of animals in medical research has been a topic of debate for many years. Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research for the benefit of human beings. They argue that animal testing has led to numerous breakthroughs in medical science, including the development of vaccines, antibiotics, and cancer treatments. They believe that the benefits of animal testing far outweigh the costs, and that it is a necessary evil in the pursuit of improving human health.On the other hand, there are those who strongly oppose the use of animal testing in medical research. They argue that animals are sentient beings with feelings and emotions, and that it is morally wrong to subject them to pain, suffering, and death in the name of scientific progress. They believe that alternative methods, such as computer simulations, cell cultures, and human clinical trials, can be just as effective in advancing medical knowledge without the need for animal testing.Personally, I believe that animal testing is morally wrong. While I acknowledge the contributions that animal testing has made to medical science, I do not think that this justifies the harm and suffering that animals endure in the process. I believe that animals have inherent value and should be treated with respect and compassion, rather than being used as mere commodities for human gain. Furthermore, with the advancement of technology, alternative methods of testing are becoming increasingly viable, making animal testing less necessary. Therefore, I strongly believe that animal testing should be phased out and replaced with more humane and ethical methods of medical research. Ultimately, our pursuit of scientific progress should not come at the expense of animal welfare and dignity.
1057;Some people feel that entertainers such as film stars, pop musicians or sports stars are paid too much money.Do you agree or disagree?Which other types of job should be highly paid?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Jobs such as actors, musicians or athlete earns a lot of money, however, a part of people argued that these kinds of people are overpaid. In my opinion, I disagree with this view and believes that they deserved the high salary.People who works as a movie stars, musicians and sports player deserved high money paid. This is because they advocated all there time and effort to get the salary that they have today. Before they become famous, they only have few incomes or even get nothing. That is to say, many musicians did not get any payment at the begining of their career, so do the actors and sports players, they spent their time but do not get any money. For instance, before being a well-known musicians, they have to spend their own money on buying equipment to produce musics or to public the songs they have made. Also, the creativety and their works cannot be measured by money. Thus, they deserved high salary because of their profession and uncopyable works.Jobs which needs professional skills and the job envolves high risk shoul also be highly paid. Such as doctors and programmers, their job are unplaceable because these envolved professional knowledge that not everyone had. Moreover, people works in high-risk environment deserved high payment too. For example, fire-fighters, they might got hurt or even die while working. Therefore, higher salary is needed for jobs that need special skills and career with high risk.To sum up, I agree with the statement because of the reasons above, and jobs with special knowledge and people works in dangerous environment should also be highly paid.;The notion that certain professions, such as actors, musicians, and athletes, are overpaid has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that these individuals earn excessively high salaries, I firmly disagree with this perspective. In my opinion, these professionals deserve the high compensation they receive, and here's why.First and foremost, the time and effort invested by these individuals to reach the pinnacle of their careers is unparalleled. Years of dedication, hard work, and perseverance are required to hone their craft and achieve success. The countless hours of practice, rehearsals, and training sessions that go into perfecting their skills are a testament to their commitment. It is only fair that their salaries reflect the immense effort they have put into their craft.Furthermore, the value of their work cannot be solely measured by monetary means. The creativity, passion, and talent they bring to their respective fields are invaluable. The joy, inspiration, and entertainment they provide to millions of people around the world are priceless. Their contributions to the arts, sports, and popular culture have a profound impact on society, shaping our values, attitudes, and aspirations.Additionally, jobs that require professional skills and involve high risk should also be highly compensated. The physical and mental demands of being a professional athlete, for instance, are enormous. The risk of injury, the pressure to perform, and the constant scrutiny they face are all factors that justify their high salaries. Similarly, the creative process of producing music, films, or other forms of art can be emotionally and psychologically taxing, warranting fair compensation for their work.In conclusion, I firmly believe that actors, musicians, athletes, and other creative professionals deserve the high salaries they earn. Their dedication, hard work, and valuable contributions to their respective fields justify their compensation. Rather than being overpaid, they are fairly rewarded for their efforts, and their salaries reflect the immense value they bring to society.
1289;Some people feel that fashion is like art and a significant part of society, while others feel that fashion is a waste of time and money.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"The fashion industry today is an important component of society and people’s lives. It is true that many people care little for clothes and scorn the importance that others attach to them; however, this does not mean that the significance that people give to fashion is a waste of time and money.When one considers that areas of the world suffer from poverty, disease and inadequate access to food and clean water, the emphasis attached to fashion by the developed world can seem out of proportion. Many people would contend that the resources put into developing and creating fashion would be more ethically spent on creating some level of equality in terms of the right to live a healthy and happy life. This point is hard to argue with. However, it is also true that people in the developed world cannot be expected to send all their spending money to people in need and that wanting to look good is an unalterable human trait.The fashion industry contributes to the society much like most other industries. It provides jobs and income to millions of people around the world and the money that changes hands generates taxes that contribute to the fabric of society. There is more to fashion than trying to look better than others and excessive luxury. The high level of fashion is indeed a kind of art form and, like other art forms, there will always be people who appreciate it, want to create it and want to spend money on it. It is part of the development of civilisation and this is not likely to change.I therefore feel that, although the gap between the rich and the poor sometimes makes it seem that fashion is a waste of time and money and an unethical use of resources, fashion is an important part of today’s society and economic output. This leads me to believe that trying to strike a balance between selfish greed and a more altruistic way of living should be an individual choice.";The fashion industry has become an integral component of modern society, deeply ingrained in the lives of individuals worldwide. It plays a significant role in shaping cultural norms, influencing personal expression, and driving economic growth. However, many critics argue that the vast resources allocated to the development and creation of fashion could be better utilized in addressing pressing social issues, such as inequality. They posit that the emphasis on materialistic pursuits detracts from more meaningful and equitable distributions of resources.On the other hand, it is undeniable that the desire to look good and present oneself in an appealing manner is an inherent human trait. Throughout history, people have sought to adorn themselves in ways that reflect their status, societal position, and personal identity. Fashion serves as a means of self-expression, allowing individuals to convey their unique personalities, values, and beliefs through their attire and accessories. This fundamental aspect of human nature suggests that the fashion industry, rather than being a frivolous indulgence, is actually a response to a deep-seated human need.Moreover, the fashion industry is not mutually exclusive with the pursuit of social equality. In fact, many fashion brands and designers are increasingly incorporating ethical and sustainable practices into their operations, recognizing the industry's potential to drive positive change. By promoting fair labor conditions, using eco-friendly materials, and celebrating diversity, the fashion industry can contribute to a more equitable society while still catering to the human desire for self-expression and aesthetic appeal.In conclusion, while the allocation of resources to the fashion industry may seem frivolous at first glance, it is essential to acknowledge the profound impact fashion has on human identity and expression. Rather than viewing fashion as a hindrance to social equality, it can be seen as an opportunity to promote positive values and practices, ultimately contributing to a more harmonious and inclusive society.
1294;Some people feel that learning a foreign language is an essential component of a child’s education. Others feel that learning a foreign language is often a waste of time that can be better spent on learning about technology and other more vocational subjects.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Throughout the history of education, learning a foreign language or languages has been a constant component. Of course, many people feel that this is really an unnecessary part of education for everyone, but this is not a point of view that I share.The opponents to learning a foreign language might argue that most people do not travel that often outside their own country. In addition to this, out of all the countries of the world, comparatively not many share the same language. Therefore, learning a foreign language will only be useful for the very limited time that one spends in a country where this language is used. For some people, the language might never be used in their entire lives. When one thinks about how much time and money are spent training language teachers, buying resources, going on trips and delivering lessons for such a negligible benefit, this would seem to be a very inefficient allocation of resources.However, the benefits of learning a foreign language go further than just the ability to use it from time to time on a holiday or business trip. Firstly, through learning one language, one gains an understanding to some extent of how all languages work. Thus, no matter where people might end up around the world, the knowledge of language can be of use. Secondly, with the study of a foreign language, one also opens oneself up to other cultures. This allows in turn an appreciation for different points of view and belief systems. With an ever-shrinking world due to globalisation, the ability to empathise and understand the people from other countries is vital to reducing conflict and creating a more tolerant society. Finally, quite simply learning languages is excellent for the improvement of general cognitive skills.It seems to me that learning a foreign language, therefore, is more than just gaining the ability to speak a few words of a foreign tongue. It is part of intellectual and social development and needs to be continued for everyone in today’s schools.;The notion that learning a foreign language is an unnecessary aspect of education has been a topic of debate among many. However, the advantages of acquiring a foreign language extend far beyond the occasional use on a holiday or business trip. In fact, learning a foreign language offers a multitude of benefits that can have a profound impact on an individual's perspective and understanding of the world.One of the primary benefits of learning a foreign language is that it provides an understanding of how languages work in general. By studying one language, individuals gain insight into the intricacies of language structure, syntax, and semantics, which can be applied to other languages as well. This newfound understanding can foster a deeper appreciation for the complexities of human communication and facilitate further language acquisition.Moreover, learning a foreign language opens doors to new cultures, allowing individuals to immerse themselves in diverse perspectives, values, and belief systems. As people become familiar with the customs, traditions, and ways of life of other cultures, they develop a more nuanced and empathetic worldview. This, in turn, enables them to engage with people from diverse backgrounds, fostering global understanding, tolerance, and cooperation. By embracing the richness of foreign languages and cultures, individuals can broaden their horizons, challenge their assumptions, and cultivate a more open-minded and informed approach to life.In conclusion, the benefits of learning a foreign language are multifaceted and far-reaching. Rather than being a redundant aspect of education, it is an invaluable tool for personal growth, cultural enrichment, and global connectivity. As we navigate an increasingly interconnected world, the ability to communicate across linguistic and cultural boundaries is becoming ever more essential. Therefore, it is imperative that we recognize the significance of foreign language education and continue to promote its importance in our academic institutions.
1073;Some people feel that the design of newly constructed buildings in big cities should be controlled by governments. Others believe those who finance the construction of a building should be free to design it as they see fit.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is often argued that governments should involve in construction's design in huge cities, while others argued that governments do not have to retrict the free of designers' imagination if those designs are splendid fit on the cities. I believe that if that were to happen, it would be the positive development. This essay will highlight the both views and give personal opinion from the former argument's side.To begin with latter opinion, although governments have worried about the combination of buildings entirely, the strong limitation about design can cause squandering of designers' skills. There are huge number of competitions about designing building in this society, and the evolution in these fields has developed dramatically. However, if there is a strict criteria on design of building, the majority of intelligences do not need to hammer away to come up with revolutional outline for building.On the other hand, signitured design of the big cities by itself can be the purpose of trevelling as a landmark, and it can be followed by significant economical achievement in the country. To take myself as an example, in 2017, I went to Gold Coast for study automotive engineering, and I was stunnied becaused of the atmosphere which is formed by combination of similar buildings and beach. Furthermore, according to the research from Sydney university, Gold Coast is one of the cities which make a fortune because of marvelous view.To sum up with, I would therefore argue that in spite of the fact that building design restriction can influence on architects negatively, it has a potential ability to make a significant profit in the future.;The age-old debate about the purpose of traveling has sparked intense discussion among travelers and wanderlusters alike. On one hand, some argue that the primary purpose of traveling is to experience different cultures, to immerse oneself in the local way of life, and to learn from the customs and traditions of foreign lands. They believe that traveling is about broadening one's perspective, learning new things, and gaining a deeper understanding of the world.On the other hand, others claim that the signature design of big cities, by itself, can be the purpose of traveling as a landmark. They argue that iconic cities like Paris, New York, or Tokyo, with their stunning architecture, vibrant streets, and world-class attractions, are destinations in their own right. For them, traveling is about marveling at the grandeur of these cities, taking in the sights and sounds, and experiencing the unique energy that only these metropolises can offer.Personally, I tend to side with the latter argument. I believe that the design of big cities is, in and of itself, a compelling reason to travel. The grandeur of iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower or the Statue of Liberty is awe-inspiring, and the experience of walking through the bustling streets of a foreign city is exhilarating. Moreover, the cultural and artistic expressions that are embedded in the architecture, art, and cuisine of these cities make them a treasure trove of creative inspiration. Whether it's the art deco skyscrapers of Manhattan or the Gothic spires of Barcelona, the signature design of big cities is a siren call to travelers, beckoning them to come and experience the magic that only these destinations can offer. In conclusion, while cultural immersion is undoubtedly a vital aspect of traveling, I firmly believe that the signature design of big cities is a purpose worthy of traveling in its own right.
1292;Some people feel that with the rise of artificial intelligence, computers and robots will take over the roles of teachers. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;With ever increasing technological advances, computers and robots are replacing human roles in different areas of society. This trend can also be seen in education, where interactive programs can enhance the educational experience for children and young adults. Whether, however, this revolution can also take over the role of the teacher completely is debatable, and I oppose this idea as it is unlikely to serve students well.The roles of computers and robots can be seen in many areas of the workplace. Classic examples are car factories, where a lot of the repetitive precision jobs done on assembly lines have been performed by robots for many years, and medicine, where diagnosis, and treatment, including operations, have also been assisted by computers for a long time. According to the media, it won’t also be long until we have cars that are driven automatically.It has long been discussed whether robots and computers can do this in education. It is well known that the complexity of programs can now adapt to so many situations that something can already be set up that has the required knowledge of the teacher, along with the ability to predict and answer all questions that might be asked by students. In fact, due to the nature of computers, the knowledge levels can far exceed a teacher’s and have more breadth, as a computer can have equal knowledge in all the subjects that are taught in school, as opposed to a single teacher’s specialisation. It seems very likely, therefore, that computers and robots should be able to deliver the lessons that teachers can, including various ways of differentiating and presenting materials to suit varying abilities and ages of students.Where I am not convinced is in the pastoral role of teachers. Part of teaching is managing behaviour and showing empathy with students, so that they feel cared for and important. Even if a robot or computer can be programmed to imitate these actions, students will likely respond in a different way when they know an interaction is part of an algorithm rather than based on human emotion.Therefore, although I feel that computers should be able to perform a lot of the roles of teachers in the future, they should be used as educational tools to assist teachers and not to replace them. In this way, students would receive the benefits of both ways of instruction.;The increasing presence of computers and robots in various aspects of society is a trend that cannot be ignored. As technology continues to advance, it is being utilized to replace human roles in multiple fields, including education. Interactive programs and digital tools are being introduced in classrooms to enhance the learning experience for children and young adults. These innovations have the potential to make education more engaging, accessible, and effective. However, the question of whether this technological revolution can completely replace the role of teachers is a topic of debate.While technology can undoubtedly augment the educational process, I firmly believe that it cannot fully replace the role of a teacher. Teachers bring a unique set of skills and qualities to the classroom that are essential for a well-rounded education. They provide emotional support, guidance, and mentorship, which are crucial for students' social and emotional development. Moreover, teachers have the ability to adapt their teaching methods to meet the individual needs of their students, which is a level of personalization that current technology cannot match.Furthermore, education is not just about imparting knowledge, but also about fostering critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills. Teachers encourage discussion, debate, and exploration, which are vital components of the learning process. They also serve as role models, instilling values such as discipline, hard work, and respect, which are essential for students' personal and professional growth. In conclusion, while technology can certainly enhance education, it is unlikely to completely replace the multifaceted role of teachers. The human element in education is invaluable, and it is crucial that we strike a balance between leveraging technology to improve learning outcomes and preserving the irreplaceable contributions of teachers.
1285;Some people like to own the place where they live, but other people like to rent where they live. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The debate over whether it is better to own or rent the property in which one lives is one that has strong supporters on each side. There are persuasive arguments for both points of view.One of the main advantages of renting a property is flexibility. Usually, a tenant only has to give a month’s notice before changing where he or she lives. If a property is owned and a change is needed, the property must be put onto the market and it is frequently a long and stressful process to get a sale completed. Sometimes, the wrong time of year or a bad market can mean that a sale is not possible. Another advantage of renting is that a large amount of a family’s capital is not tied up in the property. Property can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and often a lot more. If one rents, this money can be spent on other things to help improve the family’s quality of life. If the property is on a mortgage, then the deposit, also often very large, is tied up in the property and the pressure of having to make substantial payments every month can cause a lot of stress.Owning a property does have various advantages, though. Even though people usually have to service a mortgage every month with payments, this money is then built up with the property. With renting, the money is lost to the landlord, but at the end of the term of the mortgage, the whole property is owned by the family. This makes the process of living in a property a type of investment. In addition, the property’s value often goes up after time, frequently creating a substantial profit. Owning the property where one lives can also create a sense of well-being and self-actualisation.The decision to whether one rents or owns the property in which one lives really boils down to individual preference. My opinion is that it is much more preferable to own a property, mainly because it creates a valuable asset for the family.;The debate over whether it is better to own or rent the property in which one lives is a contentious issue, with strong supporters on each side presenting compelling arguments. On the one hand, the proponents of renting argue that it offers greater flexibility, as individuals are not tied to a specific location for an extended period. This allows them to relocate easily in pursuit of better job opportunities or to suit changing family circumstances. Moreover, another significant advantage of renting is that it does not require a large amount of a family's capital to be tied up in the property, thus providing them with liquidity to invest in other avenues or to use in times of need.However, in my opinion, it is much more preferable to own the property in which one lives. Owning a property creates a valuable asset for the family, which appreciates in value over time and can serve as a financial security net. Unlike renting, where monthly payments contribute to the landlord's wealth, owning a property allows individuals to build equity and have a tangible asset that can be passed down to future generations. Furthermore, owning a home provides a sense of stability and permanence, encouraging long-term investments in the property and the community. While the initial costs of purchasing a property may be high, the long-term benefits and the sense of accomplishment that comes with owning one's own home far outweigh the flexibility and liquidity offered by renting. Therefore, for those who have the means and plan to stay in one location for an extended period, owning a property is the more beneficial and rewarding option.
1405;Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding changes. Others, however think that change is always a good thing. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;Nowadays, people are arguing whether an ideal lifestyle should be a stable one or should it include a wide ranges of changes.In my opinion, whether changes are needed should be determined the of you are at.Apparently, are favorable the development of young people, in to their careers. Primarily, an abundant experience in varieties of jobs enables the young to master a broad range of techniques and skills, leading to significant edge over counterparts in the competition for employment. Meanwhile, trying various roles in life and work provides wide of lifestyles for the young in the future. Only after this comparison can they realize what the real goals of their .However, other than frequent changes, the elderly who have undergone all these challenges may pursue a steady lifestyle. For the elders, concentration on their favorite activities would give rise to a sense of enjoyment and security, which is helpful to physical and psychological health. Due to a stable life, the elderly are less exposed to stress, leading to a decrease in adrenal hormones and resulting in their well-.Furthermore, degeneration of mental and physical function would make the elderly unlikely to adapt to external changes, causing and , which are not contributing to their health.Above all, it is unlikely to describe the changes in life with a positive or negative term. Accommodation for personal needs and goals is more important than the changes themselves.;The concept of an ideal lifestyle has sparked a heated debate, with some arguing that stability is key, while others believe that a wide range of changes is essential. In my opinion, the need for change should be determined by the stage of life one is at. For young people, particularly those in the early stages of their careers, changes are not only beneficial but also necessary. A dynamic lifestyle that includes diverse experiences, new challenges, and various opportunities for growth is favorable for their development. This allows them to explore different fields, gain a broad spectrum of skills, and ultimately discover their passions and strengths.On the other hand, for the elderly who have undergone numerous challenges and have reached a stage of life where they have achieved their goals and stabilized their careers, a steady lifestyle may be more appealing. After years of navigating through the ups and downs of life, they may seek a more predictable and calm existence. This stability can provide them with the peace and tranquility they desire, allowing them to reflect on their accomplishments and enjoy the fruits of their labor without the burden of constant change and uncertainty.In conclusion, the ideal lifestyle is not a one-size-fits-all concept. What constitutes an ideal lifestyle varies significantly with age and personal circumstances. While changes and diversity are essential for the growth and development of young individuals, stability and predictability may be more suited for those in their later years. Ultimately, the key to an ideal lifestyle is finding a balance that aligns with one's current stage of life, allowing for personal fulfillment and happiness.
1423;Some people say education is the only critical factor to the development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;One the one hand good education is a highly recommended skill in the developed countries, on the other hand of many people in regions of poverty. But what makes education key factor for the development of a countryWe must acknowledge that education is something that we all need. The differences are just what we learn. Mostly the limited educational horizons of poor and less educated people have more to deal with their personal situation than with problems of bigger effects on a country. Attending school is sometimes too expensive and it does not feed a family.Nevertheless there must be a reason for education. For me it looks like some countries have realized that Education is the key for the globalization process. If we take India for example we can see that a change in the educational system had changed the economy of the country. country has changed from a poor region to a high potential for IT knowledge.In regard to this fact of education seriously and offer it to a wide range of people. Spending money education is the key tippy title=”for”]to[/tippy] a new future effects on the economy and social life. All in all I agree with the importance of education for the development of a country. Less knowledge leads to poverty and . Learning and Knowledge is Power and an investment in the near future and therefore it has to be an official task.;The role of education in the development of a country cannot be overstated. It is a key factor that has been recognized by numerous countries as a vital component in their journey towards globalization. Education serves as the foundation upon which a country's future is built, and its significance extends beyond the individual to encompass societal and economic development.For many nations, education has become a priority, and this is evident in the emphasis they place on educational reforms and investments. These efforts are designed to ensure that the workforce of tomorrow is equipped with the necessary skills to compete in an increasingly interconnected world. The realization that education is the key to the globalization process has prompted countries to reevaluate their educational systems, making them more aligned with the demands of the global market.The benefits of prioritizing education are multifaceted. Not only does it lead to a more educated and skilled workforce, but it also contributes to innovation, economic growth, and social stability. Countries that have invested heavily in their educational systems have seen significant improvements in their economic performance and global competitiveness. Furthermore, education plays a crucial role in fostering critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and creativity, all of which are essential for driving innovation and progress in the globalized world.In conclusion, education is indeed a cornerstone for the development of a country and its integration into the global economy. The recognition of education's pivotal role in the globalization process has prompted many countries to prioritize educational development. As the world becomes more interconnected, the importance of education in equipping individuals and societies with the tools necessary to thrive in a globalized environment will only continue to grow. Therefore, it is imperative for countries to continue investing in education to ensure they remain competitive and prosperous in an increasingly complex and interconnected world.
87;Some people say free time activities for children should be organized by parents. Others say that children should be free to choose what they do in their free time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Whether parents should fully intervene in their children's organization of their leisure time or let them decide it, remains a big discussion. In this essay I will contrast the two opinions and I will explain why I think a good balance is needed.One of the reasons supporting the first view is the idea of the undeveloped children's ability to organize. This is because, although some of them might seem very mature for their age, others might struggle understanding the importance of having a routine, besides playing video games. For instance, many parents orientate their children helping them to organize hobbies and teaching a very important skill, time managment.On the other hand, some people encourage children to decide themselves what to do as this stimulates creativity and personal growth. This view, therefore, opens a new world for the little ones who can decide whatever they like, having multiple options. For example, children in this situation quite often are supported when they want to play sports or participate in a painting class.In my opinion, parents should not only be envolved as much as they can in all aspects of their children's lives, but also they might encourage the little ones to have personal opinions and decision about their hobbies and leisure actitivities. This may be a good way to build trust and communication between parents and children. Moreover, children learn responsability while being guided by their parents.In conclusion, some parents help their children more in scheduling their free time, while others intervene less leaving them to create a routine freely. I believe, parents should always be involved in their children's lives and decisions, allowing children participation too, which brings multiple benefits to their relationship.;The role of parents in scheduling their children's free time has been a topic of debate among many. Some parents take a hands-on approach, helping their children plan out their free time, while others adopt a more laid-back attitude, allowing their kids to create their own routine. In my opinion, I firmly believe that parents should be involved as much as they can in all aspects of their children's lives, including scheduling their free time.When parents are actively involved in planning their children's free time, they can ensure that their kids are engaging in activities that are both fun and beneficial. For instance, parents can encourage their children to participate in sports, join clubs, or take up hobbies that help develop their skills and interests. This not only helps children discover their passions but also teaches them valuable life skills such as time management, teamwork, and discipline. Moreover, parents can also monitor their children's screen time, ensuring that they are not spending excessive hours on gadgets and instead, engaging in physical activities or spending quality time with family and friends.On the other hand, leaving children to create their own routine without any guidance can lead to unhealthy habits and poor time management. Children may end up spending too much time watching TV, playing video games, or browsing through social media, which can have negative impacts on their physical and mental health. Furthermore, when parents are involved, they can also help their children set boundaries and prioritize tasks, teaching them essential life skills such as responsibility and self-regulation.In conclusion, I believe that parents should be involved as much as they can in scheduling their children's free time. By doing so, they can help their kids develop healthy habits, discover their passions, and learn valuable life skills. Parents should strike a balance between giving their children independence and providing guidance, ensuring that their kids grow into responsible, confident, and well-rounded individuals.
1330;Some people say that all popular TV entertainment programmes should aim to educate viewers about important social issues. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It is often said that all influential TV entertainment programs should be geared towards raising people’s awareness about social issues that matter. While some TV programs could be suitable for this purpose, I disagree with the view that it should be mandatory for all of them, as the decision whether to do so must take into account the nature of the TV content and the channel’s audience.There is a large group of professionals who would benefit from deepening their understanding of what is happening in the world. Stock traders and bankers, for example, must always keep track of numerous business trends on a global scale, and they would appreciate this type of information on their favourite TV shows. Young people are another suitable audience due to the fact that they enjoy learning about popular topics from TV programmes. For instance, SDGs or the Sustainable Development Goals has now become an important topic to learn for children at school. Educational TV would provide a welcome alternative to textbooks, making learning more fun.Despite the potential advantages of incorporating educational content in TV programs, it is important to remember that the purpose of entertainment TV is for people to escape reality, to take a break from their hectic lives. Being reminded about some troubling social issues would not be appreciated by those who just want to unwind after a long day at work. Another consideration is how the content is perceived by the audience, because broadcasting serious topics as part of a comedy show might lead some viewers to believe they are of lesser significance. This would make TV shows of light-hearted nature a poor choice for inclusion of content on pressing social issues.In conclusion, entertainment TV programs can be an effective form of education for some people and a great tool to spread information. However, not all of them should be used for this purpose as there are various ways people appreciate them.;The role of entertainment TV programs in education is a topic of ongoing debate. While some argue that these programs are solely meant for leisure, others believe that they can be an effective form of education for certain individuals. It is true that entertainment TV programs can be a valuable educational tool, as they have the ability to engage and captivate audiences in a way that traditional teaching methods may not.For instance, documentaries, historical dramas, and science-based shows can provide viewers with a wealth of information on various subjects, making learning a fun and enjoyable experience. Moreover, these programs can also promote critical thinking, as viewers are encouraged to analyze and interpret the information presented to them. Additionally, entertainment TV programs can also provide a platform for discussing social issues, raising awareness, and promoting cultural understanding.However, it is essential to note that not all entertainment TV programs are suitable for educational purposes. Some programs, such as reality TV shows or soap operas, may not provide any educational value and are primarily meant for entertainment. Furthermore, people appreciate entertainment TV programs in different ways, some may watch them solely for relaxation and entertainment, while others may use them as a learning tool. Therefore, it is crucial to distinguish between programs that have educational value and those that do not, and to use them accordingly.In conclusion, entertainment TV programs can be a valuable educational resource for some people, as they have the ability to engage and educate audiences in an entertaining and interactive way. Nevertheless, it is vital to recognize that not all programs are suitable for educational purposes, and to use them in a way that respects their intended purpose and the diverse ways in which people appreciate them. By doing so, we can harness the potential of entertainment TV programs to promote learning and education, while also acknowledging their role as a source of entertainment and relaxation.
1353;Some people say that arts subjects are as essential as academic ones and should be part of school syllabus (agree/disagree);"Some people say that art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are an essential part of education, and every school should include them in its syllabus. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your opinion and examples from your own experience.Art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are fundamentals that enrich our lives. However, some parents say schools on teaching more academic subjects, such as mathematics, science, literature and history. In my opinion, both academic and arts subjects should be taught and I will expand on the pros and cons of including arts in the school program further on in this essay.On the one hand, academic subjects are often required when we get into higher . Academic subjects may be considered as in the academic world. Personally, I have never taken an entrance exam of art subjects for high school or university. In other words, schools measured my academic abilities using academic subjects, not art subjects. To suit the current educational system, many parents in my home country, Japan, send their children to cram schools to study academic subjects deeply.On the other hand, art subjects can strengthen the creativity and flexibility of individuals. Liberal arts, which include cultural understanding and knowledge, also include other arts subjects. In addition, we are living in the era of automation and artificial intelligence which are replacing human labor and office work more and more. In this regard, human creativity becomes more important. Therefore, art subjects are being more in demand to make a difference between individuals and computers.In conclusion, academic and arts subjects should blend in a school syllabus in a balanced way. Art subjects can also a better personality in individuals, so participation in these classes should be encouraged as well as academic achievements.The writer explored the reasons why including arts subjects in school syllabus is a good idea, while fluently expressing ideas and supporting them by examples. Correct paragraphing assists with orderly presentation of information, making this essay easy to follow; the range of vocabulary is quite wide. Accuracy of expression needs a bit more attention (see corrections underlined in blue), but overall, this essay could achieve IELTS Band 8.";The debate about what subjects should be prioritized in schools has been ongoing for years. On one hand, some people believe that art subjects such as music, drama, and creative writing are the fundamentals that enrich our lives, fostering creativity, self-expression, and emotional intelligence. These subjects allow students to explore their imagination, develop their critical thinking skills, and build confidence. They provide a platform for students to express themselves, tap into their emotions, and connect with others on a deeper level.On the other hand, some parents argue that schools should focus more on teaching academic subjects like mathematics, science, literature, and history. They believe that these subjects are essential for building a strong foundation in critical thinking, problem-solving, and analytical skills. Academic subjects provide students with a solid understanding of the world, its mechanisms, and its complexities, preparing them for future careers and real-life applications.In my opinion, both academic and art subjects are crucial and should be taught in schools. A balanced curriculum that incorporates both types of subjects can provide students with a well-rounded education, enabling them to develop a wide range of skills and interests. By studying academic subjects, students can gain a deep understanding of the world and its workings, while art subjects can help them develop their creative side, think outside the box, and approach problems from unique angles.By offering a mix of both academic and art subjects, schools can cater to different learning styles, abilities, and interests, allowing students to thrive and reach their full potential. Moreover, this holistic approach to education can help students become more empathetic, open-minded, and innovative individuals, equipped to make a positive impact in their communities and the world at large. Ultimately, a balanced curriculum is essential for nurturing the next generation of leaders, thinkers, and creatives.
779;Some people say that modern technology has made shopping today easier, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion;It is commonly argued that the fast pacing technology has helped people do shopping at the present time more easily. However, some people think online shopping is really difficult for them. This essay will consider both the advantages and disadvantages of the use of technology for shopping.One disadvantage of online shopping can be mentioned is that people cannot familiarize themselves with online applications for ordering essential goods and food. In fact, the elderly are not good at technology enough to go to virtual supermarkets. Besides, those who live in remote areas are not accessible easily to technology to buy online groceries.Despite its disadvantage, online shopping has brought about advantages for those who are technology natives. Firstly, it can be time-saving. In fact, shoppers can order any things they need with some clicks on the items, payment method, and time of delivery. Especially in a lingering Covid-19, when social distancing measures have been effective in some places in Viet Nam, according to a survey, the number of online shoppers has been increasing day by day, and thus many applications have been into existence, developed, and thrived.Another advantage of virtual shopping is that it can be life-saving to many people in a pandemic across nations. Going to supermarkets can be detrimental to buyers due to the spread of viruses and the higher risk of infection. For example, in order to buy bread for breakfast, people have to go out for it and thus may be exposed to infectious or incubated victims of Covid-19. Moreover, with preventive measures of Covid-19 containment, such as people not being allowed to go out for their essential goods, if they do not know how to make an online order, it is really difficult for them to survive during a pandemic.In conclusion, the use of technology for virtual shopping is beneficial to our time-saving and life-saving matters, though it is not familiar to some people. In my opinion, thanks to its advantages, I will continue to go shopping online, though the world has gone through the Covid-19 pandemic successfully.;The advent of online shopping has revolutionized the way people purchase goods and services. While some individuals may find it challenging to navigate the digital marketplace, online shopping has undoubtedly brought about numerous advantages for those who are tech-savvy. Technology natives, who have grown up with the internet and mobile devices, have seamlessly adapted to online shopping,. They can easily browse, compare prices, and make purchases with just a few clicks.Despite its disadvantages, such as the lack of tactile experience and potential security risks, online shopping has become an essential part of modern life. It has opened up new avenues for consumers to access products and services that may not be available in their local markets. Moreover, online shopping has enabled people to shop from the comfort of their own homes, 24/7, without being restricted by geographical boundaries or time zones.The benefits of online shopping have been particularly pronounced during the pandemic, which has affected nations worldwide. With lockdowns and social distancing measures in place, online shopping has been a lifesaver for many people. It has enabled them to purchase essential items, such as food, medicine, and other necessities, without having to physically visit stores. This has not only helped to reduce the risk of transmission but also ensured that people have access to the things they need to survive. In conclusion, while online shopping may pose some challenges for some individuals, its advantages, particularly for technology natives, and its role in providing a lifeline during the pandemic, cannot be overstated. As the world becomes increasingly digital, it is likely that online shopping will continue to play a vital role in shaping the way we live, work, and interact with one another.

It is akin to a wonder box, which contains every type of information, making it easily accessible to anyone with a connection.

727;Some people say that the experiences a child has before starting school have the most influence on their future life. Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. Discuss both views and give your own opinion?;There are a lot of research about development in human life, Some people say that the experiences a child has before starting school have the most influence on their future life. Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. In the following paragraph, I will discuss both view and give my opinion.On the one hands, There has a research that bad experience in children before begining at school, especcially in family, will become unforgettable deep heart. For example, Children who live with strict parents and has aggressive punishment when children doing littie wrong things. In the future, Children will tend to aggressive and feeling they has not received a love from family. This research surely reasonnable because family is an important factor of social life.On the other hands, There have an opinion even if children was velvet glove when raised with family. However, Especially in adolescent, Friend and teacher can infleuence as same as family because teenagers spend more time at school that with family as a reason learning in classroom more than primary school and have a more group work with friend. Thus, If teenager prefer to close with a good student (not smoking or drinking alcohol / invite classroom friends travel education museum in weekends or holiday), Parents can make sure that your child will mature to standard adults.In conclusion, In my opinion, Children would be infleuenced by family before begining at school. After that, They will has a lot of complex relationship in school from friends and teachers that can infleuences children. So, Children should try to control yourself in moral to be a best quality adults.;The debate about the most influential period in human development has been a longstanding one, with numerous research studies attempting to shed light on this complex issue. Some people argue that the experiences a child has before starting school have the most significant impact on their future life. They claim that early childhood experiences, particularly those related to family and social interactions, lay the foundation for a person's emotional, social, and cognitive development. For instance, a child's attachment to their caregivers, their exposure to language and literacy, and their opportunities for socialization all contribute to their future academic and personal success.On the other hand, others contend that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential in shaping one's future. They argue that adolescence is a critical period of identity formation, during which individuals begin to explore their interests, values, and relationships. School experiences, such as academic achievements, peer relationships, and extracurricular activities, play a significant role in shaping a teenager's self-concept, motivation, and career aspirations. Moreover, school provides a platform for teenagers to develop important life skills, such as problem-solving, communication, and teamwork, which are essential for success in their future endeavors.In my opinion, both perspectives have merit, and it is difficult to pinpoint a single period as the most influential. However, I tend to agree that early childhood experiences lay the foundation for future development, while teenage years, especially at school, provide a critical period for refinement and exploration of one's identity and interests. Ultimately, a combination of both early childhood and teenage experiences, along with ongoing support and opportunities, contributes to a person's overall development and success in life. By acknowledging the importance of both periods, we can work towards creating a supportive and nurturing environment that fosters healthy development and growth throughout an individual's life.
337;Some people think history has nothing or little to tell us, but others think that studying the past history can help us better understand the present. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;With the development of technology, an increasing number of people try to acquire the latest technology such as computer programming, rather than to study history. There is a debate whether studying histroy could give us more advantages to understand the present society. In my opinion, obtaining knowledge of past history would be definitely helpful for us to live well in society today. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.To begin with, looking back on history would give us the opportunity to notice mistakes which human beings used to make in the past. Specifically, all kinds of people and countries around the world had made innumerable mistakes throughout history. Besides, some of these mistakes might result in a huge number of victims. Therefore, human beings must avoid these tragedic events happening again. Above all, only knowing history could lead to avoidance of the recurrences. To be more specific, World War must be one of the serious events in human being history, and understanding of this truth have a significant impact on how we should live not to cause war again in the present society. It is manifest that leaning history is meaningful in this regard.On the other hand, some arguments can be made that old stories have little something to do with our present lives. However, closer examination would reveal that all the relationships present today originally come from something in the past. Knowing history enables us to find the best way to a fruitful future. The compelling example of this is racial discrimination in the U.S. Understanding the U.S. history could give us the best manner not to deteriorate relationships in the U.S. I suppose that studying history would be helpful for all human beings from this aspect.Having considered all the arguments above, learning history would be a major contributor to a better understanding of the present because we can know how to avoid the same mistake people used to made and how we should behave for the better result through history.;The question of whether studying history provides advantages in understanding present society has sparked a heated debate. In my opinion, obtaining knowledge of past history would be definitely helpful for us to live well in society today. I hold this opinion for two primary reasons.Firstly, studying history allows us to learn from past mistakes and successes, thereby enabling us to make more informed decisions in the present. By examining historical events, we can identify patterns and trends that have shaped the world we live in today. This knowledge can be applied to contemporary issues, helping us to avoid repeating past errors and instead, build upon past achievements. For instance, understanding the causes and consequences of historical conflicts can provide valuable insights into resolving current geopolitical tensions.Secondly, studying history provides a deeper understanding of the cultural, social, and economic context in which we live. History offers a unique perspective on the evolution of societal norms, values, and institutions, allowing us to appreciate the complexities and diversity of human experience. By recognizing the historical roots of contemporary social issues, such as inequality, discrimination, and political upheaval, we can develop more effective solutions to address these problems. Moreover, history helps us to appreciate the achievements and contributions of different cultures and communities, fostering greater empathy, tolerance, and cooperation in our globalized world.In conclusion, studying history is essential for understanding the present society. By learning from past experiences and appreciating the historical context of contemporary issues, we can navigate the complexities of modern life with greater wisdom and foresight. As such, I firmly believe that obtaining knowledge of past history is indispensable for living well in society today.
411;Some people think students should study the science of food and how to prepare it. Others think that school time should be used in learning important subjects. Discuss both views and give your opinion?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;These days a portion of the society consider that students must learn the subject of cooking food and ways to make meals meanwhile, a group of people think that educational institutions shall be used to study more essential courses. I strongly agree that schools should be used for learning far important subjects rather than cooking classes. In this essay a im going to examin and discuss both phenomenon viewpoints and draw my personal opinion.In one hand, some people think that cooking and food subjects should be an important courses in schools,in addition, the steps of preparing meals and information about food may help students for a healthy lifestyle.On the other hand, a group of individuals consider that cooking is a hobby and cooking classes must be optional to the student and not requiered for all students, to illustrate even more, a bigger portion of students may not be interested in cooking as others,whereas, schools must be used for more serious purposes ,for example, studying more complicated courses will have a positive effect on the students academic outcomes ,meanwhile, adding courses such as cooking might effect the students time manegement and influence their ability to focus on the important things,for further explaination, if they have a test or different assignments deadlines they should be really focusing on that rather than attending cooking classes.In conclustion, and after analysis of both penomenon i presonally believe that cooking classes should not be considered as an essential course for students in educational institutions.;The inclusion of cooking and food subjects in school curricula has sparked a heated debate among educators and parents. On one hand, some people strongly believe that these subjects should be an integral part of the school curriculum. They argue that teaching students the steps of preparing meals and providing them with information about food can have a significant impact on their health and wellbeing. By learning about cooking and nutrition, students can develop essential skills for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including meal planning, grocery shopping, and food preparation. This, in turn, can help them make informed decisions about their diet and reduce the risk of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related health problems.On the other hand, a group of individuals consider cooking to be a hobby, rather than a necessary skill, and therefore believe that cooking classes should be optional, rather than required for all students. They argue that not every student is interested in cooking, and that forcing them to take cooking classes can be a waste of time and resources. Moreover, they believe that students should have the freedom to choose their own extracurricular activities and interests, rather than being mandated to participate in cooking classes. According to this perspective, cooking classes should be offered as an elective, allowing students who are genuinely interested in cooking to pursue their passion, while others can focus on other subjects that align with their interests and strengths.Ultimately, the decision to include cooking and food subjects in school curricula should be based on a careful consideration of the benefits and drawbacks. While there are valid arguments on both sides, it is essential to recognize the importance of teaching students about healthy eating habits and nutrition, as well as respecting their individual interests and autonomy. By striking a balance between these competing perspectives, schools can provide students with a well-rounded education that prepares them for a healthy and fulfilling life.
59;Some people think that governments should ban dangerous sports, while others think people should have freedom to do any sports or activity. Discuss both views and give your own opinion;From the known history of the humanity, many sports or activities have been done to enjoy ourselfs, keeping in shape, or spent time. Grown up people should be free to do any kind of sports or activities by their will unless they are not hurting anyone else except theirselfs.Some people think when a citizen hurt his/herself, tax payers need to pay for the health care fees, and it should not be consern for the tax payers since they are paying only for fundamental situations. This point of view is not matching with the freedom. Yes, there might be a fee for tax payers, yet freedom should be above on all fees. While some people prefers less dangerous activities, others can be interested in more dangerous activities, as well.Governments can have some precautions to make citizens' life better. Yet, they should not involve such things like banning sports since it is the preference of the people which dealing with the dangerous sports. Some people could want to make more unique or exciting sports, and it is quite natural. Banning such kind of activities can be considered as limiting people's freedom.Since most of the people living together for a quite time in a society, people should pay respect on each others preferences, unless it is not interesting other people's personal area. As a calm and relax person, I am not intend to make dangerous sports or activities. However, I do not think that I have the right or power to say other people what should they do or not, and vice versa.;The debate over individual freedom to participate in sports and activities of one's choice has sparked a heated discussion. On one hand, some argue that people should be free to engage in any sport or activity they desire, as long as they are not harming others. This perspective prioritizes personal autonomy and the right to make choices about one's own body and well-being. On the other hand, some individuals express concern that when an individual harms themselves while participating in a high-risk activity, taxpayers may be burdened with the cost of their healthcare.However, it is essential to recognize that people have different preferences when it comes to sports and activities. While some may prefer less dangerous activities such as walking or yoga, others may be drawn to more thrilling and risky pursuits like skydiving or extreme skiing. It is crucial to respect these differences and allow individuals to make informed decisions about their own lives. As long as participants are aware of the potential risks and take necessary precautions, they should be free to engage in the activities of their choice.It is also worth noting that the argument about taxpayers bearing the cost of healthcare for individuals who harm themselves while participating in high-risk activities is not a sufficient reason to restrict personal freedom. Many everyday activities, such as driving or even walking down the street, carry some level of risk, yet we do not prohibit these activities. Instead, we focus on educating individuals about potential hazards and providing them with the necessary tools and information to make informed decisions. Ultimately, people should be free to choose their own sports and activities, as long as they are not harming others, and it is not the responsibility of the government to dictate what activities are acceptable or not.
1325;Some people think that hosting an international sporting event is beneficial for a country, while others disagree. Do the advantages of hosting a major sporting event outweigh its disadvantages?;International sporting events are well-known for attracting a high level of attention because they give many people something to look forward to. Understandably, there are advantages and disadvantages for the host country, and careful consideration is required to determine whether a nation will benefit or lose from hosting a major sports championship.Worryingly, the new infrastructure required for hosting a major sporting event often comes at the expense of local people. Their lives get disrupted by construction works and at times residents have even been evicted from their homes for stadiums to be built. Worse still, practice shows the expensive, gigantic buildings constructed for the sports event aren’t being used afterwards and fall into disrepair, leaving the country with high maintenance bills. The financial burden from hosting the Olympic Games, for example, is staggering and can run into tens of billions. Still, the question remains whether or not the pros outnumber the cons.It is hard to underestimate the amount of influence on the country’s global status and prestige that comes with becoming a home to an international sporting event. New trade opportunities appear on the horizon, as it happened for many countries that hosted the Olympic Games. There is also a welcome increase in tourism, which gives the local economy a boost, injecting billions of dollars into the national budget. Construction of new stadiums, hotels and infrastructure such as new roads and rail links creates new jobs, further improving the country’s economy. Less tangible but still important is the aspect of national pride and the feel-good factor associated with hosting an international sports event.All in all, it seems to me that an international sporting event can bring more good than harm to a country, especially if its potential dangers can be avoided or minimised. Hosting a World Championship is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a country and an immense source of pride for its citizens.;International sporting events, such as the Olympics and the World Cup, are highly anticipated and closely watched by people all over the world. These events give millions of people something to look forward to, fostering a sense of excitement and unity among fans from different countries. However, the hosting of such events is a complex issue that requires careful consideration, as it has both advantages and disadvantages for the host country.On the one hand, hosting a major international sporting event can bring numerous benefits to a country. It can boost tourism, create jobs, and stimulate economic growth. The influx of visitors and investment in infrastructure can also lead to improved facilities and amenities, which can be enjoyed by citizens long after the event is over. Additionally, hosting a major sporting event can raise a country's international profile, promoting its culture and values to a global audience.On the other hand, there are also significant drawbacks to consider. Hosting a major sporting event can be extremely costly, with expenses including stadium construction, security, and logistics. These costs can be a burden on the host country's economy, particularly if the event does not generate sufficient revenue to offset them. Furthermore, the event can also put a strain on the country's resources, including transportation, accommodation, and healthcare systems. Therefore, it is crucial for a country to carefully weigh the potential advantages and disadvantages before deciding to host a major sporting championship. Ultimately, with careful planning and consideration, hosting a major international sporting event can be a rewarding and beneficial experience for a country, but it is not a decision that should be taken lightly.
575;Some people think that hosting international sports events may be beneficial for a country. Discuss both views.;Certain people believe that organizing international sports competitions could benefit host countries. While hosting sport events might also entail risks, I firmly believe that nations would gain much more than they would lose, as I will explain below.International sport competitions are usually large events that bring together thousands of people including athletes, staff, and tourists. This usually represents an attractive opportunity for local business and investors. People need to be fed, thus activating restaurants' economy. Additionally, they need a place to sleep and rest, which would benefit hotels. On the other hand, many countries hosting international competitions build new infrastructure, including stadiums, pools, public squares, and even airports. It is clear that several cities around the world have developed as a result of hosting such events. Let us take the example of the city Montreal in Canada, which hosted the olympic games a few decades ago. Organizing sports events also represents an opportunitty to improve the international image of a country. For example, it is not a secret that some countries such as Germany and Russia have used the World Cup to improve their international image, with positive results overall. Finally, since inhabitants of the host nation would feel inspired to practice a new sport, we could argue that competitions could additionally improve the health and wellbeing of citizens in the long term.It is important to mention, however, that hosting sport events might also entail some risks. These competitions are usually complex and expensive to organize, and middle- or low-income economies could better use their resources to build vital infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools. Moreover, examples around the world illustrate that some politicians see these events as an opportunity for curruption.In conclusion, there are more benefits than risks for countries when it comes to hosting international sport events. These events might translate into economic opportunities for local business and investors, could bring new infrastructure, and may trigger development.;International sport competitions have become a staple of modern entertainment, bringing together thousands of people from around the globe. These large events attract not only athletes and staff, but also tourists who flock to witness the excitement and drama of the competitions. The sheer scale of these events necessitates significant investment in infrastructure by the host countries. New stadiums, swimming pools, public squares, and even airports are built to accommodate the influx of visitors and provide a seamless experience for participants and spectators alike.The construction of new infrastructure can have a lasting impact on the host country, potentially boosting its economy and enhancing its reputation on the global stage. However, hosting international sport events also entails some risks. One of the primary concerns is the financial burden associated with staging such large-scale events. The costs of building and maintaining new infrastructure, as well as providing security and services for the event, can be substantial, and there is always a risk that the revenue generated by the event may not cover these expenses.Moreover, the massive influx of people can put a strain on local resources and services, potentially leading to logistical challenges and disruptions to everyday life for residents. Despite these risks, many countries continue to bid for the opportunity to host international sport competitions, highlighting the perceived benefits and prestige associated with these events. With careful planning and management, the risks can be mitigated, and the hosting of international sport competitions can be a successful and enriching experience for all involved. Ultimately, the benefits of hosting such events, including the promotion of international unity and the celebration of athletic achievement, make them a valuable and enduring part of our global culture.
1017;Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Whilie some people believe that we can live with climate change instead of dealing with that, I don't agree with this idea because climate change can bring various disadvantages for our life.There are many disadvantages of climate change which can gradually push animals and also human to extinction. First and foremost, climate change promote the process of global warming which is one of the most dangerous result of climate change. Because of this situation, ice in 2 polar areas is melting day by day. As a result, the level of sea water will go up. Therefore, countries which are near by the sea may be drown in the future. Another drawback of climate change is that it causes many disaster. The figure for disaster is predicted to increase because of climate change. Hence, people and animals will have to deal with many dangerous disaster which can bring a lot of damage.Beside, I believe there are also many way to prevent climate change. Firstly, from my perspective, education is the best way to deal with the changing of climate. Because education raises the awareness of people about how dangerous climate change is, and it also teach people to protect the environment. Therefore, the effect of climate change will decrease. Secondly, local community should hold more volunteer activity for people to clean the palace where they live, so people can make sense of environmental protection and their neighborhood will also be cleaned. This activity can also contribute to prevent climate changeIn conclusion, I believe that people can't live with climate change and people have to prevent it.;Climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time, and its consequences can have far-reaching and devastating effects on our lives. One of the most notable impacts of climate change is the rapid melting of ice in the two polar regions, the Arctic and Antarctica. The ice in these areas is melting at an alarming rate, day by day, and this has severe implications for our planet.As the polar ice caps melt, the sea levels are rising, posing a significant threat to countries and islands located near the sea. In the future, these areas may be at risk of being completely submerged underwater, displacing millions of people and destroying entire ecosystems. The prospect of countries being drowned by rising sea levels is a stark reality that we may face if climate change continues to worsen.The effects of climate change are not limited to polar regions or coastal areas. It can have a ripple effect on global food production, leading to crop failures, reduced yields, and changed growing seasons. Additionally, climate change can also lead to more frequent and intense natural disasters such as hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves, which can have devastating consequences for human life and infrastructure.It is imperative that we take immediate action to mitigate the effects of climate change. This can be achieved by reducing our carbon footprint, investing in renewable energy sources, and implementing sustainable practices in our daily lives. Governments, organizations, and individuals must work together to address this pressing issue and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come. The consequences of inaction will be catastrophic, and it is our responsibility to act now to prevent the worst effects of climate change.

In my view, the wrong way is to stay at home in your leisure time if you have a job.;As humans, we naturally require rest and leisure time to alleviate the stress of work and everyday life. This downtime is essential for our physical and mental well-being, and allows us to recharge and refocus. During this time, individuals are free to pursue activities of their choice, and it is ultimately up to each person to decide how they want to spend their leisure hours.Personally, I prefer to be active during my leisure time because it provides me with a sense of fulfillment and joy.

What should exactly be done during this free time has been the subject of debate for a while. Some would argue that engaging in simple and less brain tasking activities during this time keeps the mind busy,facilitates mental alertness and sanity.While other scholars would argue that keeping the mind relaxed would improve focus and recharge the mind for when needed at work after the free period has waned off.On the one hand, it seems beneficial to engage in activities that keeps the mind slightly engaged during our leisure period. This is basically due to the fact that some mind consciousness might be lost when idle.Sluggishness may thereforeset in when required to partake in activities that requires full attention. Hence playing chess and games might help maintain ones' awareness during a less busy period. Secondly, getting involved in basic activities like reading and surfing the internet during these free period could also help improve ones intellectual capacity and also overall general knowledge that could well be very beneficial to improving the entire state of the mind.On the other hand, those who say its essential to rest the mind after extensive period of activities might have a point.This is because resting the mind will help recharge Ones' batteries and general condition of the mind.

865;Some people think that it is more beneficial to take part in sports which are played in teams, like football, while other people think that taking part in individual sports, like tennis or swimming, is better. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Sport play an essential role in shaping the personality of individual. Some people believe that sports which are played in teams are more beneficial like football, while others think that solo sports like tennis or swimming is better. The following essay will discuss both arguments and give my opinion that sports which are played in teams have more advantages over solo sport activites.First of all, there is no doubt that the individual sport activities enahnce people confidence. It helps building the personality and strentghen the mentality of the individuals. For examole, one role model in my home country was playing tennis table, he mentioned once in an interview, that sport helped him not only to win trophies but it raised his mental strength and shaped his pesonality.However, some people believe that, sports which are played in teamshave more advantages and all community will get the benefits. Soccer, for example, will help the players specifically the young children to understand working together and sharing the responsibility. In addition people will grow with better understanding to the concept of sharing achievements which can improve all the community. For instance, i was a member of soccer team in high school, me and my friends were taught, in order to win games we should put plans together and work as one unit. Furthermore, it helps me later in my career to understand the meaning of leadership and how the sharing responsibility and working together could bring the success to our endeavour.To conclude, solo sport can bring proud and honour to individuals butsports which played in teams teach people the meaning of working together which will improve the community in the future.;The debate about whether team sports or solo sport activities are more beneficial has been ongoing for a long time. While individual sports have their advantages, it is undeniable that team sports have more benefits. On one hand, individual sports activities do enhance people's confidence, as they are solely responsible for their performance. This helps in building their personality and strengthening their mentality. Solo athletes learn to rely on themselves, which can lead to increased self-assurance and a stronger sense of self-worth.On the other hand, team sports offer a multitude of benefits that solo activities cannot match. Team sports foster a sense of camaraderie and teamwork, as individuals work together towards a common goal. This promotes social skills, communication, and problem-solving abilities. Moreover, team sports encourage healthy competition, motivation, and discipline, as teammates rely on each other to achieve success. The teamwork dynamic also promotes empathy, mutual respect, and trust among teammates, leading to stronger and more meaningful relationships.In my opinion, team sports have more advantages over solo sport activities. While individual sports do help build confidence and personality, team sports provide a unique combination of physical, emotional, and social benefits. The bonds formed among teammates and the collective sense of achievement are unparalleled in solo activities. Furthermore, team sports often provide a support system, where teammates can motivate and encourage each other, both on and off the field. This support system can lead to increased self-esteem, resilience, and overall well-being. In conclusion, while individual sports have their advantages, the benefits of team sports, including social skills, teamwork, and camaraderie, make them a more rewarding and beneficial option.
765;Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children’s development than playing computer games. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Some individuals believe that playing outside has a more positive effect on children's development rather than playing computer games. I share the idea that being involved in outdoor activities is more beneficial than playing computer games.Active development is the main reason for including outdoor activities in children's life. All people know that the development of children is an extremely significant part of building a personality. To do so parents should try to involve their children in exploring local insects, animals or playing different games such as football, riding bicycles, and many other. This will only expand the knowledge of children, and consequently have a positive effect on their development. This is also important to have a healthy generation in the future. Parents can join their children or they can find some friends around and also be socially active. For example, a father can teach his son how to bicycle or how to take care of plants and trees.The next important reason for doing more outdoor activities for children is avoiding physical problems, which can cause computer games. Currently, a lot of people including children suffer from different side effects of a lazy lifestyle and obesity can exemplify it. To avoid problems with physical health in the future, spending a couple of hours should be recommended to all children.Of course, little time spent playing computer games will not hurt children, but it is important to limit it. To sum up, children should do more outdoor activities and play computer games less.;The Importance of Outdoor Activities for ChildrenIn today's world, where technology has become an integral part of our lives, it is essential to remind ourselves of the importance of outdoor activities for children. While computer games can be entertaining and educational, they should not replace physical activities that are crucial for a child's active development. Spending too much time indoors, playing computer games, can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which can have severe consequences on a child's physical and mental health.Active development is the main reason why outdoor activities should be a significant part of a child's life. Outdoor play helps children develop their motor skills, coordination, and balance. It also encourages social interaction, teamwork, and communication, which are essential life skills. When children engage in outdoor activities, such as sports, cycling, or simply playing in a park, they develop their problem-solving skills, learn to take risks, and build confidence. These skills are vital for their overall development and will benefit them throughout their lives.Another important reason to limit computer game time and encourage outdoor activities is to avoid physical problems associated with a sedentary lifestyle. Prolonged periods of sitting and screen time can lead to obesity, eye strain, and poor posture. Moreover, excessive computer game playing can also lead to a lack of sleep, poor diet, and decreased attention span. Outdoor activities, on the other hand, provide children with fresh air, exercise, and a healthy dose of vitamin D, which are essential for their physical and mental well-being.In conclusion, it is crucial for children to engage in outdoor activities and limit their computer game time. Outdoor play is essential for active development, social interaction, and physical health. By encouraging children to spend more time outdoors, we can help them develop into happy, healthy, and well-rounded individuals. As parents, educators, and caregivers, it is our responsibility to ensure that children have access to outdoor spaces and activities that promote their overall development and well-being.
613;Some people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;It is often argued out there about sports, debating about both physcial and mental strengths and which is far more crucial to the success. This essay will go over these two points of view in further depth and outline some expamples, where relevant, for each.On one side, some people think that the most important factor to succeeding in sports is the physical strength. Body strength is actually quite indispensable in any sport activity, especially those types of sports that demand a high fitness level and high physical endurance, etc, such as MMA fights, wrestling, football, and so on. All of these require an elevated and advanced charachterestics of one's body. For example, an athlete can not keep up a football match and running around for 90 minutes without a high body endurance, fitness, so on and so forth.On the other hand, the others believe that a powerful mentality and mindset are needed for such success and accomplishment. That is, they believe that one's attitude is the first key to success before anything else. People need to have some sort of a mindset with specific qualities, such as perseverance, determination, concentration, etc. and it's not always about havign a massive body strength. For example, some MMA athletes step in the ring with solid bodies, will not always win the games if they're not determined and persistent already, altought their opponents do not have that huge bodies. It's all about the mindset.In conclusion, it's not easy to decide which of these two criteria is more important than the other. However, I believe that any athlete must have these two, train them both before getting into any challenge, no matter what type of activity. An athlete must have a strong body and a trained attitude once and for all.;The debate about the most crucial factor in achieving success in sports has been ongoing, with some individuals arguing that physical strength is the key to triumph, while others claim that a powerful mentality and mindset are essential. On one hand, the importance of physical strength cannot be overstated. A strong and healthy body is necessary to withstand the physical demands of various sports, and to perform at a high level. Athletes with superior physical strength often have an advantage over their opponents, as they can run faster, jump higher, and exhibit greater endurance.On the other hand, a powerful mentality and mindset are also vital for success in sports. Mental toughness enables athletes to push themselves beyond their limits, to stay focused under pressure, and to bounce back from setbacks and failures. A strong mindset allows athletes to develop resilience, to build confidence, and to maintain a winning attitude, even in the face of adversity. Moreover, a positive mindset can also enhance physical performance, as athletes with a growth mindset tend to recover faster, train more effectively, and compete with greater intensity.In conclusion, it's not easy to decide which of these two criteria is more important than the other. Both physical strength and mental toughness are intertwined and complementary, and each plays a critical role in achieving success in sports. Ultimately, the most successful athletes are often those who possess a combination of both physical and mental strength, allowing them to perform at their best and overcome the challenges they face. As such, it's difficult to prioritize one over the other, and athletes should strive to develop both their physical and mental abilities in order to achieve their full potential and succeed in their chosen sport.
1386;Some people think that students who don’t take a break in studies between the high school and the university are at disadvantage compared to students who travel and work after high school before further continuing their education. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, in our competitive world, to succeed, knowledge from school and university is not enough. Therefore, students who study from the school to university get fewer benefits and contribute less too, compared to those who travel or work and get experience and skills . There are two following reasons to support for my opinion. I refer to the group of people who study from school to university as ‘group A’ and the other group – as ‘group B’.Firstly, at school and university, what group A gains is almost entirely theory, theory and theory. Of course, theory is very , however, you can’t do everything with just theory. You must have experience. This is what group A . Although in the third or fourth year at university, group A can be apprentices in some companies, to help them approach their future jobs, they aren’t trained well because of the short time spent working. And the real job is still very strange to them. After graduating, without experience, group A students can’t accomplish their work perfectly. On the other hand, it takes them time and money to keep up with other experienced students and they may be scorned. Therefore, group A students can contribute less than group B who have the two most important things: skills and experience.Secondly, as group A students are contributing less, they surely get less benefit. Moreover, many companies which employ people in group A have to train them from ground-up. These companies take this cost from group A’s salary to reduce the risk of their employees leaving to other companies after being trained. So, less benefits are unavoidable and certain, group B members are more loyal and effective workers. They also have useful experience and skills. Besides, their education is the same as or even higher than that of group A. As the result, group B gets more benefits absolutely.In conclusion, I think a student should travel or work before going to the university. That way, not only will they have basic knowledge but also skills and experience which are useful for them to get a good job and have a brilliant future.;In today's competitive world, the acquisition of knowledge from school and university is no longer sufficient to guarantee success. The rapid pace of technological advancements, shifting industry trends, and evolving societal needs have created a landscape where mere academic knowledge is inadequate. As a result, students who solely rely on the traditional educational pathway from school to university often find themselves at a disadvantage.The benefits of a conventional education are undeniable, yet they are limited. Schools and universities provide a foundational understanding of various subjects, critical thinking skills, and the ability to analyze and solve problems. However, these institutions often struggle to keep pace with the dynamic nature of the modern workplace. The curriculum may not always reflect the current demands of industries, leaving graduates ill-prepared for the complexities and challenges of their chosen career paths.Consequently, students who only study from school to university contribute less to their fields and society at large. Their skill set, although robust in an academic context, lacks the practical, real-world application that employers and communities increasingly require. This shortfall in contribution stems not from a lack of intellectual capability, but from the narrow focus of traditional education systems. In contrast, individuals who supplement their academic learning with extracurricular activities, as well as continuous learning and professional development, are better positioned to make meaningful contributions. They possess a more comprehensive set of skills, including adaptability, creativity, and the ability to innovate - all of which are highly valued in today's fast-paced, competitive environment.In conclusion, while knowledge gained from school and university lays a crucial foundation, it is no longer enough on its own to ensure success or significant contribution in our competitive world. Students must look beyond the classroom, embracing lifelong learning, practical experiences, and skill development to truly thrive and make a lasting impact.
1281;Some people think that the most important thing about being rich is it gives a person the opportunity to help other people.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Helping other people in society is noble goal ,to some people it's a big achievement .However rebuilding personality of individuals and giving them an opportunity to leave an influence in the community is reflecting the genuien humanity .Therefore i agree with notion that rich people who are, in fact have the ability to offer the help for orthers in order to recreate healthy environment for everbody to work in our society .The following essay will illuminate the reason behind my opinion .Regrettably . many people suffer form disadvantages situtaions nowdays like losing jobs or money ,they find themselves have no energy or motive to contiune and to help their families . As a result of that poverty propagates in some society and usually accompany with low level availability of education . Hence to avoid falling into misery, some countries nowdays help non governmenrtal organizations and institutions to give assist to poor communities in a manner to raise education and develop health sector. For instance , Red Cross and Save the children , both organizations offere help and leverage human rebuild personality which no doubt will enrich these communities with several benefits .In spite of green vevet picture that mentioned above , some people think that helping people alone is not enough . However , others believe that no matter how grim or daunting things may seem , if the individual have the courage to move a head , then everything is possible . Nevertheless people can find the motive inside eventhoughlife handed them a toughest time . For example Helen Keller .An American Author , although she born with disability but she could be one of greatest authors in western history .In summary , no doubt that people should have the courage to move a head whether they find help from others or not . However people who can offer the help will make our community live peacefully and bring prosperity to our offsprings .;Helping other people in society is often considered a noble goal, and to some, it's a big achievement. However, the true essence of humanity lies in rebuilding the personalities of individuals and providing them with opportunities to make a positive impact in their communities. This reflects genuine humanity, as it not only offers temporary assistance but also empowers people to become active contributors to society.Rebuilding an individual's personality involves helping them to regain their confidence, self-esteem, and sense of purpose. This can be achieved through various means such as education, counseling, and job training. By giving people the tools and support they need to succeed, we can help them to become productive members of society, capable of making a positive difference in their communities. This, in turn, creates a ripple effect, where one person's positive influence inspires others, contributing to a healthier and more harmonious social environment.Therefore, I agree with the notion that rich people, who have the ability to offer help, should do so in order to recreate a healthy environment for everybody to thrive in. Their wealth and resources can be utilized to establish programs, initiatives, and institutions that focus on rebuilding personalities and empowering individuals. By doing so, they not only contribute to the betterment of society but also leave a lasting legacy that reflects their commitment to the well-being of humanity. In conclusion, helping others is not just about providing temporary aid, but about empowering them to become the best version of themselves, and in doing so, creating a more compassionate, equitable, and prosperous society for all.
1081;Some people think that there should be strict laws to control the amount of noise a person makes because of the disturbance it causes to people.Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;With the increasing population in cities,noise pollution has been one of the important causes of concern.This essay presents the advantages and disadvantages of the strict laws that are made to control noise pollution.Noise pollution affects different groups of people in various ways.The increasing noise in recent days has led to increasing problems of hearing impairment in people in today's society.Also,the noise pollution has a devastating affects on the heart patients and it has been affecting people who are working and studying in various ways.By implementing strict rules like imposing heavy fines on vehicles honking unnecessarily and filing a case on the noise caused by the public gatherings like rallies,the above problems can be addressed.For example, recent studies have shown that the cities having less noise pollution have been leading better life when compared to those with noise pollution.However,implementing strict laws on noise caused by a person also has some disadvantages.Firstly,different religions have different kinds of festivals which cause a lot of noise.For instance,diwali,one of the most celebrated festivals in India,is celebrated by firing crackers causing a lot of noise is affected by implementing these laws.Secondly,most of the people with religious beliefs will have a bad impact by these rules.To give an example,the prayers in masjids are made with loud noise so that it can reach a large group of people living in the area.To conclude,implemeting strict rules like fines and filing a case on the people causing noise pollution have a good impact on the health of the society and increasing the efficiency of work where as the festivals and the religious centres have a negative impact by these laws.;The implementation of strict laws on noise pollution has been a topic of discussion in recent years. While the intention behind such laws is to reduce noise levels and promote a more peaceful environment, it is essential to consider the potential drawbacks of such regulations. Implementing strict laws on noise caused by a person also has some disadvantages that need to be taken into account.Firstly, different religions have various kinds of festivals that inevitably generate a significant amount of noise. For instance, festivals like Diwali, Christmas, and Eid are celebrated with fireworks, music, and other loud festivities. Implementing strict noise laws could potentially dampen the spirit of these celebrations, which are an integral part of many people's cultural and religious heritage. It is crucial to strike a balance between reducing noise pollution and respecting the rights of individuals to practice and celebrate their faith.Secondly, the prayers in masjids (mosques) are often made with loud noise so that they can reach a large group of people living in the area. The call to prayer, or Azan, is an essential part of Islamic worship and is traditionally recited aloud. Similarly, other religions also have their unique ways of prayer and worship that may involve loud chanting or music. Strict noise laws could potentially restrict the freedom of individuals to practice their faith and could be seen as an infringement on their religious rights.In conclusion, while reducing noise pollution is essential, it is crucial to consider the potential consequences of implementing strict laws on noise caused by individuals. The laws should be framed in a way that respects the cultural and religious diversity of a community, allowing people to practice and celebrate their faith without undue restrictions. A balanced approach that takes into account the needs and rights of all individuals is necessary to ensure that the laws are effective and fair.

693;Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Space, so unknown for the humankind that it generates so much curiosity among experts and enterprenues. Due to this curiosity, the amount of resources and money invested in its exploration is surprisingly big. Developing technology for it is expensive but, in my humble opinion, completly justified.Firstly, developing technology is vital so that space exploration can be carried out succesfully. Experts have discovered that we only know a 4 percent of the entire universe. If with only that 4 percent we have accomplished amazing achievements, imagine what the human race could do when knowing a 10 percent.Secondly, space exploration and the technology involve on it not only will help the human race understand the universe but also will provide a whole new kind of tourism, space tourism. The CEOs of some of the most profitable business in America are investigating this possibility. The leading enterprises in this sector are Blue Origin from Jeff Bezos and Space X from Elon Musk. When discovered the way of sending people to space safely, space tourism will generate twice the money spent on technology for space exploration.In a nutshell, space exploration is crutial for the development of the human race. Furthermore, if this was not enough, all the technology developed will serve the purpose of creating a whole new kind of tourism that will generate billions of dollars in revenue. From my point of view, even though here on earth there are several problems to be solve with money, our future lies on space, so be must spend as much money as possible.;The amount of resources and money invested in space exploration is surprisingly big, with billions of dollars being poured into this endeavor every year. At first glance, it may seem excessive, especially when considering the numerous problems that plague our planet, such as poverty, hunger, and disease. However, developing technology for space exploration is expensive, but in my humble opinion, it is completely justified.The benefits of space exploration extend far beyond the realm of scientific discovery. One of the most exciting and lucrative prospects is the emergence of a whole new kind of tourism: space tourism. As technology advances and costs decrease, it is likely that space travel will become more accessible to the general public. Imagine being able to witness the breathtaking beauty of the Earth from space, or walking on the moon's surface. The experience would be unparalleled, and people would be willing to pay a premium for it.Space tourism has the potential to become a multi-billion dollar industry, creating new job opportunities and stimulating economic growth. Furthermore, the technology developed for space exploration has numerous spin-off benefits, such as advances in telecommunications, navigation, and medical research. These innovations can improve our daily lives and solve some of the world's most pressing problems.In conclusion, the investment in space exploration is not only justified but also necessary for the advancement of humanity. The potential for space tourism to become a major industry is vast, and the benefits of space exploration extend far beyond the scientific community. As we continue to push the boundaries of space travel, we can expect to see significant returns on our investment, both financially and in terms of improving the human experience. Therefore, it is essential to continue supporting space exploration and development, as it holds the key to unlocking new possibilities and transforming our world.
1309;Some people today believe that it is acceptable to use physical force to discipline children, but others feel it is completely unacceptable.Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Punishing children with physical force, or corporal punishment as it is also called, is something that was accepted not so long ago and people over the age of forty may well remember it. Nowadays, however, corporal punishment is against the law in most countries and adults who practise it can be taken to court. Children are always a vulnerable group and they depend on adults for protection and education. Of course, part of the growing up process is testing and breaking boundaries and it is nearly always necessary to instill discipline on a child. Whether or not it is necessary to use physical force to do so can be a very emotive subject.Supporters of corporal punishment often defend their standpoint by explaining that the corporal punishment is not, or should not be, excessive. They do not argue that a child should be beaten severely until he or she is bruised or cut. They argue that just the infliction of mild pain causes effective discipline and also the fear that it might be applied. People who grew up experiencing it might offer this point of view.Those who oppose using physical force on a child would say that the vulnerability and innocence of a child means that force should never be used. Children need to trust adults and believe that no harm will come to them. Additionally, children learn from adults and it is argued that corporal punishment will only teach children that force is an answer to various problems. It is also claimed that corporal punishment has no added benefits over other forms of discipline that do not require physical force. Using it can cause psychological harm to children and should be classed as child abuse.Personally, I do not believe that limited use of forms of corporal punishment can cause harm, and a parent who administers a mild form of it to his or her child should not be subject to criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, I would not use it myself. I can also recognise the possibilities of adults who are not a child’s parents misusing corporal punishment. Therefore, I believe that on balance physical force to discipline children should not be permitted.;"The use of corporal punishment as a means of disciplining children is a highly debated topic. In most countries, corporal punishment is against the law, and adults who practice it can face serious consequences, including being taken to court. The argument against corporal punishment is rooted in the vulnerability and innocence of children, with many believing that force should never be used as a means of discipline. The idea is that children are impressionable and trusting, and the use of physical force can have long-lasting and detrimental effects on their emotional and psychological well-being.On the other hand, some argue that a parent who administers a mild form of corporal punishment to their child should not be subject to criminal proceedings. They believe that a mild and infrequent use of physical force, such as a gentle tap on the hand, is not harmful and can be an effective means of discipline. However, this is a fine line to tread, as what constitutes ""mild"" can be subjective and open to interpretation.Personally, I would not use corporal punishment myself. While I understand the arguments on both sides, I believe that there are more effective and less damaging ways to discipline children. Positive reinforcement, clear communication, and setting boundaries are all alternative methods that can be used to teach children right from wrong without resorting to physical force. Furthermore, using corporal punishment can create a culture of fear and resentment, rather than encouraging children to learn and grow from their mistakes. Ultimately, the goal of discipline should be to teach and guide, not to intimidate or harm, and I believe that there are better ways to achieve this goal than through the use of corporal punishment."
1358;Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems, is this a positive or negative development?;Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems. Is it a positive or negative development? Give your own opinion and examples from your experience.At present, the Internet plays a vital role in almost every aspect of human life. As a result, individuals are searching online reasonable solutions to their illnesses. Not everyone is convinced that access to such information online is safe and helpful. However, in my view, providing the general public with access to trustworthy information about medical disorders would invariably improve the quality of the medical care for the whole society.Nowadays, even though there are plenty of online platforms developed for medical education, most of the sites have not been written by professional healthcare providers. Hence, there is a high possibility of spreading wrong medical information throughout the world, unless the site developers are held accountable for the content they provide. If patients receive incorrect information about a medical procedure and follow the wrong advice, for instance, to remove a wart at home, it might lead to a serious infection, excessive bleeding or another medical emergency. That would constitute a negative effect of using online knowledge for medical treatments at home rather than visiting a professional.On the flip side, the Internet, the society is well aware of most common medical disorders and preventive measures. Consequently, a reasonable and prudent individual can decide whether to get professional opinion on one’s disease or to handle it at home, that they get reliable online medical information. Moreover, if patients can manage mild medical problems themselves, it would certainly reduce the workload at the local hospitals, freeing more doctors for patients in real need. Besides, if patients come with a certain extent of knowledge about their condition to the medical consultation, it would invariably be helpful to the medical practitioner for effective decision making.To sum up, it is evident that online search for information on medical disorders can be a positive development as long as the general public receives trustworthy information.This response addresses the topic well. The writer’s position is clearly explained and supported, the information is organised in paragraphs in an easy to follow way, and use of linking words is appropriate. A range of complex sentence forms is used and there are very few errors in word choice or word formation (underlined in blue). Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.;The advent of the internet has revolutionized the way people seek medical information, with many individuals turning to online platforms to search for solutions to their health problems. In my opinion, this development has both positive and negative aspects.On the positive side, the internet provides unparalleled access to a vast array of medical information, enabling people to take a more proactive approach to their health. For instance, a person experiencing symptoms of a rare disease can research online and potentially identify their condition, leading to earlier diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, online forums and support groups can provide emotional support and connect individuals with others who are going through similar experiences.However, there are also negative consequences to this trend. The internet is awash with unverified and misleading information, which can lead to misdiagnosis and inappropriate self-medication. I have seen friends and family members fall prey to false online claims, wasting time and money on ineffective treatments. Furthermore, the lack of personal interaction with medical professionals can lead to a lack of accountability and oversight, potentially exacerbating health problems.In conclusion, while the internet can be a valuable resource for medical information, it is crucial to approach online health advice with caution. It is essential to consult reputable sources, such as government health websites and peer-reviewed articles, and to verify online information with medical professionals. Ultimately, a balanced approach that combines online research with professional medical advice is the most effective way to navigate the complexities of modern healthcare. By being aware of the potential pitfalls and taking a discerning approach, individuals can harness the power of the internet to improve their health outcomes.
949;Some say that because many people are living much longer, the age at which people retire from work should be raised considerably.To what extent do you agree or disagree?;People nowadays are living much longer.With the discovering of new medicine and with the innovation in the medical field, the life expectancy of a person skyrocketed over the last decade.Some people might think that the consequence of this phenomenon should be the fact that the age at which people retire from work ought to be raised considerably.I don't agree with this idea.Rather than involving the life expectancy of a person, we should consider the job itself.Is it tiring? Does it require a person to be able to react immediately to a potential problem?If the job is tiring I think that it would be better for a person to retire. If you end up being worn out every day because your job is very exhausting the life expectancy should not be the fact that decides if you have or not the right to retire.The question ought to be: Is the person physically and mentally able to cope with the work?The older you get the slower you become. This is another pivotal factor that should be taken into account when deciding the retirement age of a person.The ability to react to dangerous events keeps the working environment under control.Let's imagine a carpenter working on the construction of a new building.What if a wall suddenly falls? Does an elderly person react faster than a younger worker?I am an optimistic person but I would stick to my guns in this scenario betting on the younger person.I would like to wrap up this essay by saying that I could have thought of many more reasons that explain why the age at which people retire from work should not be based entirely on the fact that people are living longer.Of course, this can not be ignored but basing this decision only on this fact it is seen by me as a poor approach.;The recent advancements in medicine and medical technology have led to a significant increase in human lifespan. Over the last decade, the life expectancy of a person has skyrocketed, thanks to the discovery of new medicines and innovative treatments. As a result, people are now living longer and healthier lives. This phenomenon has sparked a debate about the appropriate retirement age, with some arguing that it should be raised considerably. However, I strongly disagree with this notion.While it is true that people are living longer, it is essential to consider the nature of the job itself when determining the retirement age. Certain professions, such as those in the manufacturing or construction industries, are physically demanding and can take a significant toll on the body. Workers in these fields may not be able to continue working beyond a certain age, regardless of their overall health. Raising the retirement age for these individuals could lead to burnout, decreased productivity, and increased risk of work-related injuries.On the other hand, some jobs, such as those in the education or consulting sectors, may be less physically demanding and more suited to older workers. In these cases, it may be reasonable to consider raising the retirement age. However, a one-size-fits-all approach to retirement age is not the solution. Instead, we should focus on creating flexible retirement options that take into account the unique demands and requirements of each profession. By doing so, we can ensure that workers are able to retire with dignity and security, while also acknowledging the significant contributions they have made to their respective fields. Ultimately, the decision to raise the retirement age should be based on a nuanced understanding of the diverse needs and capabilities of workers, rather than a blanket policy that fails to account for the complexities of the modern workforce.
1389;Some say that the Internet is making the world smaller by bringing people together. To what extent do to you agree that the Internet is making it easier for people to communicate with one another?;"A global village, that is certainly what the world feels like nowadays. With the help of the , you can reach out and get to know people you might never have met in person. Articles can be co-authored, business deals can be finalized, degrees can be earned and at times even medical advice can be given- and all of this is just a click away.Electronic mail, instant messages, web cameras and microphones; all these gadgets and programs make the presence of the other person more real. Who knows; with the help of visual reality you might even get a 3-D image of the speaker! I believe that the Internet is one the best inventions of the last century, you can hardly get to miss anyone and nobody is really out of reach. You can keep in touch with your friends, and be able to do your work from your bedroom in your pajamas!However, the internet can also be a major source of harassment. Spammers and hackers can invade your privacy and get personal/confidential information, which otherwise they never get access to. You are never out of anybody’s reach, unless you make a conscious decision of not checking your email, there can be always more work waiting for you in your inbox and you might never have a moment to yourself. Worse yet, if you were a workaholic, you might never experience that stress-free vacation ever again in your life – simply, because you have your mobile workplace with you at all times.As a romantic, I will always look forward to getting an occasional letter in the snail mail. A personal letter, where I can sense the mood of the writer by the slants in his/her handwriting and get to know him/her better. But as a type A personality person, the internet gives me all what I dream of in terms of communication – the speed, reliability, and convenience of time and place. I can certainly tolerate its shortcomings any day, as long as it keeps me close to my loved ones.";The internet is undoubtedly one of the most revolutionary inventions of the last century. It has transformed the way we communicate, access information, and connect with others. With the internet, geographical distances have become virtually insignificant, and it is now possible to stay in touch with people from all over the world. Nobody is really out of reach, and it is hard to miss anyone who has an online presence. The internet has enabled us to maintain relationships, make new connections, and even conduct business transactions with ease.However, the internet also has a darker side. It can be a major source of harassment, with spammers and hackers posing a significant threat to our online security. These malicious individuals can invade our privacy, gaining access to personal and confidential information that we would otherwise keep secret. This can have serious consequences, ranging from identity theft to financial fraud. Moreover, the anonymity of the internet can embolden harassers, who may use the platform to bully, intimidate, or spread hate speech.Despite these risks, the internet remains an essential tool in modern life. To mitigate the negative effects, it is crucial to take steps to protect our online security. This includes using strong passwords, being cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments, and using reputable antivirus software. Additionally, governments and online platforms must work together to develop and enforce stricter regulations against online harassment and cybercrime. By being aware of the potential dangers and taking measures to safeguard ourselves, we can continue to harness the power of the internet while minimizing its risks. Ultimately, the internet is a double-edged sword, offering unparalleled benefits and unprecedented challenges, and it is up to us to use it responsibly.
655;Some systems require students to specialize in a limited range of subjects from the age of fifteen. Other systems require students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?;"Education programs are different from one area to another area, there are systems that learners are required to choose restricted number of courses for their academic curriculum by the age of 15.while,other educational systems ask students to take comprehensive courses until they graduate from school. There are many positives for both trends, in my opinion limited range of academic subjects education system is better.On the one hand, it is basic knowledge to accept the idea that pupils who study selected number of subjects from age of fifteen are more informative academically in specified field of study. For example, when student decide to take medical subjects from early age the student will be prepared by tutors completely for the nominated curriculum,as a result all the student's focus will be on medical topics thus, the student is more qualified to practice medicine more efficiently after school graduation.Furthermore, this system will build a solid knowledge background in limited range of subjects can help to develop creativity at early age.Moreover, in the financial view point it may be better for students to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15; selected number of academic subjects means less money allocated for educational services by guardians.On the other hand, it is true to claim that general subjects system can prepare students to be more informative in various different live aspects. Since, students who register with wide range subjects system can gain academic knowledge and support in fields such as mathematics,physics,medicine,and....ect. Therefore,those students can select more than one speciality to practice as a professionalism in future.Besides, wide range system help to improve social interactions better,because friends will not be separated and they continue school education together until graduation,inaddition there is chance to make more friends as primises are more crowded.To sum up, educational systems main target is to develop and progress academic background of students.But, in my opinion,it is better to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15 due to reasons like: solid academic background in specific field,creativity,and less financial burden on parents.";The debate over the ideal academic curriculum for learners has sparked a longstanding discussion. In some educational systems, learners are required to choose a restricted number of courses for their academic curriculum by the age of 15. On the other hand, some systems allow students to explore a wide range of subjects without any restrictions. Both trends have their positives, but in my opinion, the limited range of academic subjects education system is better.One of the primary advantages of restricting the number of courses is that it allows learners to specialize in specific areas of interest. By focusing on a few subjects, students can gain in-depth knowledge and develop a stronger understanding of the material. This, in turn, can lead to better academic performance and a greater sense of accomplishment. Additionally, a limited range of subjects can help learners to develop a clear career path and make informed decisions about their future.On the other hand, some may argue that a broad range of subjects provides learners with a more well-rounded education. However, I believe that this approach can lead to a superficial understanding of multiple subjects, rather than a deep understanding of a few. Furthermore, a limited range of subjects can help to streamline the educational process, reducing the workload and stress associated with managing multiple courses.In conclusion, while both trends have their advantages, I firmly believe that the limited range of academic subjects education system is better. By restricting the number of courses, learners can gain a deeper understanding of specific subjects, develop a clear career path, and achieve better academic performance. Ultimately, this approach can lead to a more focused and effective education, preparing learners for success in their chosen fields.
1347;Some think that children should leave their family home as soon as possible while others believe they should stay for as long as they like (discuss);Some people think that it is best to encourage children to leave their family home as soon as possible. Others believe children should stay at the family home for as long as they like. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayAlthough it is thought by some that urging young people to abandon their family home at an early age is beneficial for them, others believe that it is better if children stay with their families for longer. In my opinion, leaving family home early has many advantages for children.On the one people think that youngsters ought to leave their parents’ house so as to learn life skills at an early age. Their reasoning is that it should push young people towards independence and make them learn from life lessons rather than merely rely on their parents. For example, students who pursue tertiary study away from their home city might learn taking personal responsibility. Also, living independently will teach children a lot by presenting some difficulties, which, consequently, will add some more experience that may prove essential in their future lives.On the other hand, it is argued that children should stay with their parents for longer for several reasons. Firstly, young people need advice from adults, and no one would be better suited to that than their parents. Secondly, life can be generally harsh, for children in particular. In other words, they might or take unnecessary risks if they mix with the wrong crowd. It is commonly known that young people tend to be by unethical people. To avoid that, being under parental supervision is utterly important for children.To sum up, while people’s opinions may vary, I believe that young people should leave their family home at an early age, while parents ought to provide them with appropriate advice and keep an eye on their well-being.This essay covers the task by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of leaving the family home early in life, and the writer’s opinion has been clearly stated. The arguments for and against have been organised in paragraphs and supported by examples. Accuracy of expression needs some work (see suggested corrections underlined in blue) and in one case sentence structure needs more attention. Overall, assuming the errors were corrected, this essay could score Band 8 in IELTS.;The question of when children should leave their family home is a contentious issue, with some people advocating for them to move out as soon as possible, while others believe they should stay for as long as they like. On the one hand, encouraging children to leave the family home early can foster independence, responsibility, and self-reliance. By moving out, young adults are forced to manage their own finances, cook, and clean, thereby gaining valuable life skills. This, in turn, can lead to a smoother transition into adulthood, as they are already accustomed to taking care of themselves.On the other hand, allowing children to stay at home for as long as they like can provide them with a sense of security and stability. In today's economic climate, the cost of living can be overwhelming, and staying at home can alleviate some of the financial burdens associated with independent living. Furthermore, staying at home can also allow for more quality time with family members, which is essential for building strong relationships and creating lasting memories.In my opinion, I believe that the decision of when to leave the family home should be based on the individual's circumstances and readiness for independence. While some young adults may be eager to move out and start their new life, others may require more time to develop the necessary skills and financial stability. Ultimately, the key is to strike a balance between providing children with the support and guidance they need, while also encouraging them to take responsibility for their lives and become independent individuals. By doing so, we can help them develop into capable and confident adults, equipped to face the challenges of the world.
1333;Some think that young people should be free to choose any career they like, while others say that they should think more realistically about their future. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;"Choosing a future career requires careful consideration. While some people claim that adolescents should be able to pursue a career they would enjoy, others oppose to that, arguing that teenagers should aim for a high-paying job in order to secure a livelihood when they grow up. Given that our life consists of more than just physiological needs, I strongly believe that it is vital to fulfill one’s potential in the career fields that are most compatible with their interests.The youth who choose highly skilled jobs may find it easier to have a fruitful future in a materialistic sense. It is true that some professions, such as engineers or doctors, are well paid and offer more stability compared to work in other, non-professional fields. For example, psychologists usually have higher starting salaries compared to artists; they also rarely lose their jobs in recessions. People who prioritise earning a living might agree that a reliable job is a must for their future and by no means will they take risks to gain employment in a field they are passionate about, that doesn’t pay well.However, it is worth remembering that we are living in a rapidly changing world and the concept of a ‘guaranteed future’ is unrealistic. Even the smartest of us aren’t prophets and it is impossible to foresee many changes in job markets in the future; some high-salaried jobs of today may no longer exist by the time our young people become adults. Therefore, people may choose to pursue their dreams and follow career paths according to their passions and interests now, to avoid having regrets later in life.Having considered the reasons to prefer monetary remuneration over one’s interests, I am convinced that it would be a pity for youths to limit their career choices to highly paid jobs of today. Unforeseen changes in the jobs markets may affect salaries but won’t change the pleasure one derives from doing something they love.";The debate surrounding the career choices of adolescents has sparked a heated discussion among experts and individuals alike. On one hand, some people claim that adolescents should be able to pursue a career that they would enjoy, as this would lead to a more fulfilling and satisfying life. They argue that when individuals are passionate about their work, they are more likely to be motivated, dedicated, and ultimately, successful. This approach prioritizes personal happiness and job satisfaction over financial gain.On the other hand, others oppose this view, arguing that teenagers should aim for a high-paying job, regardless of their personal interests. Proponents of this perspective believe that a high-paying career provides financial security and stability, which are essential for a comfortable life. They contend that adolescents should prioritize financial stability over personal enjoyment, as it will ultimately lead to a more secure future.However, it is worth remembering that we are living in a rapidly changing world, where the concept of a 'guaranteed future' is unrealistic. With technological advancements and shifting market trends, the job market is constantly evolving. A career that is lucrative today may become obsolete tomorrow. Therefore, it is essential for adolescents to be adaptable, flexible, and open to continuous learning and skill development.In conclusion, while both perspectives have valid points, it is crucial to strike a balance between personal enjoyment and financial stability. Adolescents should be encouraged to explore their passions and interests, while also being aware of the financial implications of their career choices. By doing so, they will be better equipped to navigate the uncertainties of the rapidly changing world and create a fulfilling and successful career for themselves. Ultimately, a combination of personal satisfaction and financial stability will lead to a more rewarding and secure future.
1403;Students from rural areas often find it difficult to access university education. Some people think that it should become easier for them to study at universities. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Nowadays, it is acknowledged that students from suburban areas find it tough to receive higher education. Whether it should be made easier for them to access university education becomes an ongoing concern, which incurs a highly-charged debate.Obviously, higher education opportunities bring about benefits to students in multiple ways. For example, higher education becomes increasingly important to senior high school graduates, partly it determines if they have the competitive edge in the job market, and partly because it is seen as a guarantee of a certain level of the mental ability, from the computer literacy that is required by the most employers to the capacities of acquiring new knowledge the soonest possible which is valued by most . With a university degree, students from rural areas obtain a job easily, thereby bettering their living conditions and their family as well.Higher education also, however, to impose a heavy burden on families since the rise in the tuition fees are increasingly beyond those families’ ability to afford. In addition, with the mounting evidence, a university degree is not always a guarantee of seizing a decent job; therefore, their living conditions are likely to able to earn back their tuition fee after graduation. people argue, students from rural areas are not well-advised to pursue a university degree. But I perceive their desire to further their education should not be disrespected and the government should subsidise them to receive higher education.In conclusion, university education should be made fair to everyone, predicated only on their academic performance and mental abilities, rather than their financial capacities and the government should subsidise those students in need.Teacher’s comment: Not all the parts of the task were covered. The writer’s position is relevant to task prompt, the main ideas are also relevant but not all of them are developed well enough. The information is presented coherently, it is evident that the writer progresses from one idea to another.";The advent of higher education opportunities has ushered in a plethora of benefits for students, particularly those hailing from rural areas. With a university degree in hand, students from these areas are able to secure employment with relative ease, thereby significantly improving their living conditions and those of their families. This, in turn, contributes to the overall betterment of their socio-economic status. Higher education empowers individuals with the knowledge, skills, and competencies required to compete in the job market, breaking the cycle of poverty and underemployment that often plagues rural communities.However, it is also important to acknowledge that higher education can impose a substantial financial burden on families. The incessant rise in tuition fees has made it increasingly challenging for many families, especially those from rural and low-income backgrounds, to afford the costs associated with university education. This financial strain can lead to significant hardship, as families may have to sacrifice other essential expenditures to facilitate their child's education. Furthermore, the weight of student loans and debt can be overwhelming, leading to stress and anxiety for both students and their families.Despite these challenges, the benefits of higher education cannot be overstated. It is imperative for governments and educational institutions to implement policies and programs aimed at making higher education more accessible and affordable. This could include scholarships, grants, and flexible payment plans designed to alleviate the financial burden on families. By doing so, we can ensure that the benefits of higher education are equitably distributed, providing opportunities for socio-economic mobility to all, regardless of their geographical location or financial background. Ultimately, the pursuit of higher education should be a gateway to improved living standards and personal growth, rather than a source of financial hardship.
809;The Internet is now used all around the world as a source of information and communication. However, it's often controversial, so many people think it needs to be controlled. Others believe there should be no interference whatsoever.Discuss both points of view, and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The Internet has recently become the most widely spread means of communication and knowledge sharing. It is argued by many if any restrictions should be imposed on it. This essay will discuss both views and explain why the Internet should be free from regulations.One group of people consider that the Internet was developed to overcome a government censure, thus any restrictions will destroy its purpose. Despite the fact that there were independent media, it was practically difficult to share news internally and internationally because of low speed of communication methods such as telegraph or post, which lead to the fact that the most common source of information was government authorities who selected the information they wanted to share. Thus, general citizens’ opinion, views and problems were often unheard. This essay agrees that the ability of sharing information freely between people all over the world makes the government to be transparent as everyone’s opinion and problem may be heard. For example, the problems with extinction of wild animals in Baikal region of Russia due to forest cuts was heard only after a massive attack by the media and local citizens and bloggers that would be impossible without the Internet.The others insist that the Internet allows to people share not only useful knowledge, problems and new, but also violent content. The supporters of the view believe that having an easy access to such content, for example assault, production of bombs, people become prompt to criminal behaviour. Although, the Internet makes the violent information more available, the essay suggests that if an individual want to find violent information, he would do it even in the absence of the Internet. Moreover, recent researches conducted by criminalists uncovered that the increase in the number of criminal offenses is not directly correlated with Internet coverage.In conclusion, although the Internet contains violent content, if needed it may be accessed by interested people from other sources of informations, meanwhile independent flow of information allows individuals to attract attention to their local and even global problems which may be hidden by governments without free Internet.;The advent of the Internet has revolutionized the way we communicate and share knowledge,sweeping across the globe at an unprecedented pace. As the most widely spread means of communication and knowledge sharing, it has become an indispensable tool in our daily lives. However, the question of whether any restrictions should be imposed on the Internet has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that regulations are necessary to maintain social order and protect users, others contend that the Internet should remain free from any constraints. This essay will delve into both perspectives and argue in favor of an unregulated Internet.On the one hand, proponents of Internet regulation claim that it is essential to curb the spread of harmful content, such as hate speech, violence, and explicit material. They argue that without regulations, the Internet could become a breeding ground for malicious activities, posing a threat to individuals and society as a whole. Moreover, they believe that regulations can help protect intellectual property rights and prevent cybercrimes. However, imposing restrictions on the Internet could stifle freedom of expression, hinder innovation, and create a culture of censorship.On the other hand, the Internet's inherent nature is rooted in freedom and openness. Imposing regulations could undermine its core principles, leading to a loss of creativity, innovation, and progress. The Internet has empowered individuals to express themselves, access information, and connect with others across the globe, fostering a culture of collaboration and knowledge sharing. Furthermore, the Internet has become an essential tool for education, research, and economic development, and any restrictions could hinder these processes. In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the potential drawbacks of an unregulated Internet, the benefits of a free and open Internet far outweigh the costs. Therefore, the Internet should remain free from regulations, allowing it to continue to flourish as a powerful tool for global communication, knowledge sharing, and progress.
1397;The Internet when used as a source of information, has more drawbacks than advantages. To what extent do you agree with this statement?;Some people believe that internet access creates problems. There are several possible reasons why it can happen.Firstly, some data may be unverifiable. For example, they search for a data, there would be lots of choices that would appear on the screen. They would not be sure if the information they are reading is accurate. Some sources may even have outdated . Secondly, some sites may be unreliable. For instance, people sign up on one site that sells goods online. The goods would be paid for by a credit card, but the purchaser would not receive anything. And finally, not everything is available through the net. When my friend had tried to research for some pictures of 18th century paintings, he did not find any results. Then he was told by his teacher that they would only be available in the library.Others believe that the Internet is very useful and these are the justifications. Firstly, it is hard to get the same data, that is available through the Internet by other means. For example, if the directory information could not give me the accurate address and contact number of a place I to visit, I normally check that information on the Internet. In just one click, I would get all the details of that company. Secondly, research becomes more comprehensive. For instance, I do not have to buy lots of reading materials to complete my research. Most of the needed information can be found if I have Internet access. And finally, data is easily compared and contrasted. researched a study about overweight children a decade ago and at presentwas able to finish his research in just one day, as compared to a week if he would not use the Internet.In conclusion, let me reiterate that the Internet plays a big role in our life, because it makes data retrieval and comparison easier.;The advent of the internet has revolutionized the way we access information, transforming the world into a global village. However, some people believe that internet access creates problems, rather than solving them. This perspective is rooted in several key concerns that highlight the limitations and pitfalls of relying solely on the internet for information.Firstly, one of the primary issues is that some data available on the internet may be unverifiable. The internet is an open platform where anyone can publish information, regardless of their qualifications or the accuracy of their content. This leads to a situation where false or misleading information can spread quickly, making it difficult for users to discern fact from fiction. As a result, individuals may base their decisions or understanding on incorrect data, which can have serious consequences in fields such as education, health, and finance.Secondly, some sites on the internet are unreliable, further complicating the quest for accurate information. Not all websites are created with the intention of providing factual data. Some are designed to persuade, to entertain, or even to deceive. Without proper critical evaluation skills, users may fall prey to biased, biased, or entirely fabricated information. This can lead to misinformed opinions, wrong decisions, and a skewed worldview.Lastly, another significant problem is that not everything is available through the net. Despite the vast amount of information accessible online, there are still gaps in coverage, especially concerning specialized, local, or newly emerging topics. Relying solely on the internet for research or information gathering can lead to an incomplete picture, missing out on valuable insights or data that are only available in print, through personal experiences, or in specialized databases not accessible online.In conclusion, while the internet is a powerful tool for accessing information, it is not without its challenges. The potential for unverifiable data, unreliable sources, and the incompleteness of online information underscore the need for a critical approach when using the internet. By acknowledging these limitations, we can harness the power of the internet more effectively, ensuring that it enhances our knowledge and understanding without leading to misinformation or incomplete insights.
628;The Pie chart gives information about the country of birth of people living in Australia and the table shows where people born in these countries live.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The pie chart illustrates the percentage of Australia's population by country of birth namely: Australia, UK, New Zealand, China , Netherlands and other nations. While the table represents the percentage in where this people live in.Overall, Australian born comprises most of the country's population. With regards to the type of area they dwel in, most of them live in a city than the rural area.To begin, Australian nationalities has the highest percentage of 73%. Followed by other nation with 14%, taking up about one fourth of the population. While UK's percentage is half the former. In addition, New Zealand, China and Nertherland has a percentage of 3%, 2% and 1% respectively.With regards to the table, amongst the five, Chinese race has 99% of their people living in the city. Also, the rest has a percentage of Netherlands (90%), UK(89%), Australia (83%), and New Zealand (80%). While the remainder of the people live in the countryside, with New zealand having the most population with 20% and China being the least with 1%.;The pie chart provides a fascinating insight into the diversity of Australia's population, breaking down the percentage of residents by their country of birth. The chart reveals that the majority of the population was born in Australia, followed by significant proportions from the UK, New Zealand, China, and the Netherlands, with the remainder originating from other nations.Interestingly, the data also sheds light on the living preferences of these groups, with a notable trend emerging. Across the board, the majority of individuals from each country prefer to reside in cities rather than rural areas. This urban inclination is particularly pronounced amongst those born in China, with a staggering 99% opting to live in cities. This suggests that the amenities, opportunities, and lifestyle offered by urban centers are highly appealing to Chinese-born Australians.In contrast, while the other countries also show a preference for city living, the proportions are not as extreme as those seen amongst the Chinese population. For example, a significant majority of individuals from the UK, New Zealand, and the Netherlands also live in cities, but the percentages are lower than China's 99%. Meanwhile, the Australian-born population, which constitutes the largest segment, also displays a preference for urban living, albeit to a lesser extent than some of the other groups.The implications of these trends are noteworthy, as they may inform urban planning, resource allocation, and cultural integration strategies. For instance, the high concentration of Chinese-born individuals in cities may lead to targeted initiatives to cater to their specific needs and preferences, ensuring that they feel included and supported within their communities. Overall, the pie chart offers valuable insights into the demographic makeup and residential preferences of Australia's diverse population, highlighting the importance of considering these factors in policymaking and urban development.
109;The advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's life, English is one of the biggest common language in the world. It is often argued that the benefits of learning English as a global language will superior to its drawbacks continueously. I completely agree with this idea due to the fact that English is one of the easiest language to learn and most education system in the world involve English as one of the courses.English should be continue to use as a global langauge because it is easy to learn. Each language in the world involves different movings of the tongue in the mouth, but some of the languages have similar tongue positions with English, such as Italian, Spanish and French. It will be difficult for people in the world to start adapting a new language and using completely different tongue positions. For example, chinese, one of the most challengeable langauge in the world, it mostly does not need the support of the tongue to touch the teeth or anything else. It is hard for people with other mother language to adapt the pronounciation. Therefore, one of the biggest advantages of English as a common language is the easyness of it.In addition to the easyness of English, numorous education systems in the world include English as one of the important subjects to learn support the benefits of English that will continue to overseed its disadvantages. Since English as one of the spreading languages in the world lasts for many years. A lots of generations learn English since their childhood and English already take a huge part of their educational studies. It is hard for people to abandon this language and step out of their comfort zone. For instance, one of my best chilldhood friend learn English for almost 6 years, but since she went to Spain for two years as exchange students, she get used to the way of learn English, instead of Spanish, so she fell her grade there. It is clear that English as one of the essential courses in world, it has an important connection with the education system globally and it has a huge influence in our studies.In conclusion, the easyness of learning English and the crucial role of it in the educations system support my opinion that I completely believe that the advantages of spreading English as an important language in the world will keep outweigh its flaws.;In today's interconnected world, English has emerged as one of the most widely spoken and accepted common languages. The proposition that learning English as a global language offers more benefits than drawbacks is a widely debated topic. This essay argues that the advantages of acquiring English language skills indeed outweigh its disadvantages.On the one hand, the benefits of learning English are multifaceted. Firstly, English is the language of international communication, enabling individuals to connect with people from diverse cultural backgrounds. It facilitates global understanding, fosters business relationships, and enhances educational and career opportunities. Proficiency in English opens doors to a vast array of academic and professional resources, including literature, research, and job opportunities in multinational corporations. Moreover, English is the predominant language of the internet, with the majority of online content being in English. This makes it an essential tool for accessing and sharing information globally.On the other hand, some argue that the proliferation of English as a global language leads to the erosion of local languages and cultures. However, this drawback can be mitigated by promoting bilingualism or multilingualism, where individuals can maintain their native languages while also speaking English. This approach not only preserves cultural diversity but also enriches personal and national identities.In conclusion, the benefits of learning English as a global language far surpass its drawbacks. English serves as a bridge that connects the world, facilitating communication, education, business, and cultural exchange. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the importance of English will only continue to grow, making it an indispensable skill for individuals aiming to engage with the global community. By embracing English while preserving native languages, we can navigate the complexities of globalization with greater ease and effectiveness.
248;The bar chart below describes some changes about the percentage of people were born in Australia and who were born outside Australia living in urban, rural and town between 1995 and 2010.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;this above bar chart it is depicts the percent flock of people born in Australia otherwise people was born outside , it is clarify from the graph that we leer the a several of bars will making comparsing between them , according what is elucidate in 1995 we noitced the citzens are more likely to accomndtion into cities and also rural , for example we see nearly 50 prepertion whear as 20% in rural and comparsing to the 2010 i think the bar of cities it is kind of rise , in other hand we have very significantly decrease in rural , while the people are born out nation in 1995 it is prefer to live in cities etheir , we see the bar it is 60 percent and he is growing up very observe which in 2010 they have 80% , finaily to sum up we could say that it is very common to see like this digram bar.;The above bar chart illustrates the percentage of people born in Australia versus those born outside of the country. According to the data, in 1995, a notable trend emerged, indicating that citizens are more likely to accommodate themselves in cities as well as rural areas.As can be seen from the chart, the majority of the population was born in Australia, with a significant percentage residing in urban cities. On the other hand, a substantial proportion of the population was born outside of Australia, with many of these individuals also choosing to settle in cities. Interestingly, the data suggests that both Australian-born and foreign-born citizens are inclined to live in cities, with a smaller but still notable percentage opting for rural areas.This trend can be attributed to various factors, including better job opportunities, access to amenities, and cultural diversity, which are often associated with city life. Furthermore, the chart implies that Australia's urban areas are hubs for both native-born and international populations, fostering a multicultural and diverse environment.The fact that a significant percentage of foreign-born citizens are settling in rural areas is also noteworthy. This could be due to the attractive lifestyle and economic opportunities that rural areas offer, such as farming and agriculture. The data from 1995 highlights the complexities of population distribution in Australia, with both cities and rural areas serving as magnets for people from diverse backgrounds.In conclusion, the bar chart provides valuable insights into the settlement patterns of people born in Australia and those born outside of the country. The data from 1995 underscores the preference for urban and rural areas among both Australian-born and foreign-born citizens, reflecting the country's reputation as a melting pot of cultures and lifestyles.
1170;The bar chart below gives information about vehicle ownership in China.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information.;The chart describes the data about vehicle ownership in a particular country, China from 1987 to 1999.Overall, the highest vehicle ownership occurred in the year 1999 while the lowest trend was recorded in the year 1987.According to the chart, China has less than 500 vehicle per thousand people during 1987. It is evident that there is an increment in the figures throughout the years. Within the two year interval, the number of vehicle ownership was already at 500. In 1991, 900 vehicle per thousand people were already in possession as depicted in the graph. In between 1991 to 1995, it went up gradually to nearly a thousand. Furthermore, the vehicle ownership doubled in number in 1995. Also, in an unspecified period of time, the number of vehicle possession in that country were approximately 3,000. By the end of year 1999, the numbers rose significantly to 4,100 vehicle per thousand people.;The chart illustrating vehicle ownership in China from 1987 to 1999 reveals a notable trend. Over the thirteen-year period, a significant increase in vehicle ownership is evident, with the highest ownership recorded in 1999 and the lowest in 1987. This progression indicates a steady growth in the number of vehicles owned by individuals in China during this time frame.In 1987, the chart shows the lowest trend of vehicle ownership, suggesting that car ownership was not as prevalent at that time. However, as the years progressed, there was a consistent increment in the figures, demonstrating an upward trend in vehicle ownership. This growth can be attributed to various factors, including economic development, improved infrastructure, and changes in government policies that may have made car ownership more accessible and desirable.The most notable observation from the chart is the significant surge in vehicle ownership towards the end of the period, culminating in the highest ownership in 1999. This peak suggests that by the late 1990s, vehicle ownership had become more mainstream in China, possibly due to increased economic prosperity and a rise in the middle-class population who could afford such possessions.In conclusion, the data presented in the chart clearly shows a positive correlation between the years and the number of vehicles owned, with a marked increase from 1987 to 1999. This trend underscores the rapid development and changes in lifestyle and preferences of the Chinese population during this period. As the country continued to open up and experience economic growth, it is reasonable to assume that the demand for vehicles would continue to rise, reflecting broader socio-economic changes in China.
702;The bar chart below shows the number of houses built per year in two cities, Derby and Nottingham, Between 2000 and 2009. Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.You should write at least 150 words.;Information is presented by the bar chart which illustrates the figure for houses built each year in Derby and Nottingham over a ten-year period from 2000 to 2009. Overall, it can be seen that there was a clear trend that houses in Derby were built more than that in Nottingham each year over the survey period, except for the year 2000, 2001 and 2007.Turning to the first main feature, there were just under 50 houses which were constructed in Derby for the first two years between 2000 and 2001, while the number of houses in Nottingham was an exact 50 and a little more than 50 in 2000 and 2001 respectively. The figure for houses in Derby then increased considerably to approximately 75 in 2002, which exceeded the number of houses in Nottingham, and plateaued at more than 100 until 2006. On the contrary, in 2002 the chart depicts a noticeable decline in the number of houses in Nottingham to less than 25. Nevertheless, the number of houses in Nottingham rebounded and rose to around 75 in 2005 before dropping suddenly to nearly zero in 2006.Turning to another main feature, whereas in 2007 the figure for houses in Derby remained unchanged at above 100, the number of houses in Nottingham soared to almost 200, exceeding the number of houses in Derby. The last key feature to point out is that the number of houses in Derby jumped dramatically to nearly 350 by 2009 while the number of houses in Nottingham experienced the third drop to almost zero in 2008 before the number of houses in Nottingham increased dramatically to 250 in 2009.;The construction of houses in Derby and Nottingham has been a subject of interest over the years, with varying trends observed in the survey period. A notable observation is that houses in Derby were built at a higher rate than in Nottingham for most of the years under review. This suggests a more active construction industry in Derby, possibly due to factors such as demand, zoning regulations, or economic incentives.However, there were exceptions to this general trend. Specifically, the years 2000, 2001, and 2007 stood out as anomalies where Nottingham either matched or surpassed Derby in terms of house construction. The year 2007 was particularly significant for Nottingham, as it saw a surge in house building, with the number soaring to almost 200. This exceptional growth meant that Nottingham exceeded Derby in house construction that year, a rare occurrence during the survey period.In contrast, Derby experienced a dramatic increase in house construction by 2009. The figure for houses built in Derby jumped to nearly 350, indicating a robust recovery or surge in construction activity. This significant increase could be attributed to a combination of factors, including economic recovery, government policies, or shifts in population demographics that increased demand for housing.The fluctuations in house construction rates between Derby and Nottingham underscore the dynamic nature of the construction industry, influenced by a myriad of factors including economic conditions, government policies, and demographic changes. While Derby generally led in house construction, the exceptions, particularly the surge in Nottingham in 2007, highlight the complexity and variability of urban development trends. Overall, the data suggests that both cities have experienced periods of growth and fluctuation in their construction sectors, reflecting broader economic and demographic trends.
530;The bar chart below shows the numbers of men and women attending various evening courses at an adult education centre in the year 2009. The pie chart gives information about the ages of these course participants.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar chart shows what are the tendences of men and women in attending evening courses in an adult education centre during 2009 in a scale of 0 to 40 people, while the pie chart shows the percentages of ages of the participants in these courses.Fist of all, the most striking information is that women were largely more present in languages and painting courses than men, and that the vast majority of the participants in the overall courses were 50 years old or over.To begin with, it is clearly demonstrated that there were more women than men in all courses, except in sculture. In fact, men attended to language and drama courses were twice as less than women. Women were 40 in language courses and 20 in drama. Men were also slightly less in paiting, around 25 people, compared to women who were 30 at this course. However, in sculpture, men tended to be more present, as they were 10, which is roughly the double of the number of women who were present.Secondly, there was a marked tendence for people aged from 50 and over to attend a these courses, as they were slighlty more than two fifth. Just over a quarter of the people were between 40 and 49, while those who were 30-39 were just 16%. Finally, the youngest ones were not very present. In fact, the 20-29 years old group represented just 11%, while the under 20 were barely the half, with 5%.To conclude, it can be seen that the vast majority of the people who attended these evening courses were aged from 40 to 50 and over. Moreover, women tended to attend much more at all courses than men except for sculpture.;The demographic analysis of course participants reveals some intriguing trends. Notably, women outnumbered men in language and painting courses, indicating a strong interest in these creative fields among females. This disparity suggests that women are more inclined to pursue artistic and linguistic pursuits, and institutions offering such courses should take this into consideration when designing their programs.Furthermore, the overall age distribution of course participants showed a significant skew towards older adults. The vast majority of participants were 50 years old or over, indicating a pronounced tendency for people in this age group to attend these courses. This trend is not entirely unexpected, as retirement and the subsequent increase in leisure time can prompt individuals to explore new hobbies and interests. The fact that a substantial proportion of participants fell within this age bracket underscores the importance of catering to the needs and preferences of older adults in course design and marketing strategies.The marked tendency for people aged 50 and over to attend these courses also highlights the potential for institutions to tap into this demographic. By offering courses that cater to the interests and needs of older adults, such as flexible scheduling and tailored content, educational institutions can attract a dedicated and motivated group of learners. Moreover, this trend suggests that older adults are seeking opportunities for personal growth, socialization, and intellectual stimulation, which can have positive implications for their cognitive, emotional, and physical well-being. As the population ages, understanding and responding to the educational needs and preferences of older adults will become increasingly important for institutions seeking to remain relevant and effective.
960;The bar chart below shows the percentage of unemployed graduates, aged 20-24, in one European country over a two-year period.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and making comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart demonstrates the unemployed graduates who are between 20 and 24 years old by gender in percentage. The survey is conducted in one European country from 2008 to 2009.In general, the unemployment rates in males over a two-year period were higher than the females. The highest rate of unemployment in males was approximately 22% in Oct 2009, reaching nearly 40% more than females. Whereas the unemployment for female graduates in percentage was 6% reported in Apr 08, July 08 and Apr 09 which were the lowest rate of unemployment for graduates over the period.First of all, there was a slight decline in the unemployment rates for all graduates in the beginning of year, from 10% in Jan 08 to 7% in Apr 08 in males whilst female graduates decreasing from 7.5% to 6% . The unemployment for both genders in July 2008 remained same rates as previous. An increase in percentage of unemployed graduates in Oct 08 took nearly twofold of last month with males by 16% and females by 11%. Subsequently, a fall in the unemployment rates for all graduates were recorded in Jan 09, by 12.5% in men and 8% in women. A further reduction in the rate of unemployed female graduates in Apr 09 was 6% whilst there was no change in the male graduates. Afterwards, the unemployment rates in women returned to 10% in July 09 whereas there was a brief decrease in males by 11%. This was followed by a surge in the unemployment rates for graduates in Oct 09 by 22% for males and 14% for females.;The bar chart provides a revealing insight into the unemployment rates of graduates between the ages of 20 and 24, categorized by gender, in a European country from 2008 to 2009. This data offers a snapshot of the employment landscape faced by young graduates during this period.Upon examining the chart, a notable trend emerges: the unemployment rates among male graduates surpass those of their female counterparts over the two-year period. This disparity suggests that male graduates in this age group encountered greater challenges in securing employment compared to female graduates. Several factors could contribute to this phenomenon, including differences in fields of study, job market demands, and potential biases in hiring practices.The survey, conducted from 2008 to 2009, coincides with a period of economic flux, potentially exacerbating unemployment rates across the board. Despite these challenging economic conditions, the data indicates that female graduates managed to fare slightly better in the job market than their male peers. This could be attributed to various factors, including the types of industries or sectors that were less affected by the economic downturn, where female graduates might have had a stronger presence.In conclusion, the bar chart paints a picture of gender disparity in unemployment rates among young graduates in a European country during 2008-2009, with males experiencing higher rates of unemployment than females. Understanding the underlying causes of this disparity is crucial for policymakers and educators to develop targeted strategies that can help mitigate such differences and ensure a more equitable employment landscape for all graduates, regardless of gender. By addressing these issues, it's possible to foster a more inclusive and supportive environment for young graduates entering the workforce.
688;The bar chart below shows the total number of minutes (in billions) of telephone calls in Australia, divided into three categories, from 2001- 2008. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The bar chart displays the total number of minutes(in billions) of telephone calls in Australia. There are three types, specifically, local, national and international, and mobiles. Overall, it is clear the number of local telephone calls has the largest from 2001 to 2008, while the other two types, national and international, and mobiles steadily increased the number of telephone calls.Initially, there is a variation in local telephone calls from 2001 to 2008. The number of telephone calls started at 72 billion, and steadily soared and reached a peak of 90 billion in 2005. Then the number of billions slightly reduced and returned to 72 billion in 2008. Nevertheless, the number remained the highest in the three categories.Secondly, national and international, and mobiles can be seen steadily increase the number until 2008. National and international was 38 billion in 2001 and gradually rose up the number and reached the highest number in 2008. Specifically, it was 61 billion. Mobiles started the number only 2 billion in 2001. But the number constantly increased, and suddenly surged to 23 billion and 39 billion in 2006 and 2007 respectively. As a result, the number reached a peak of 46 billion in 2008. The gaps among three categories were quite large in 2001. It was 72, 38, and 2 in local, national and international mobile. And it resulted in a huge reduction of the gap in 2008. It was 72,61, and 46 in local,national and internationalal, and mobiles.;The bar chart provided offers a comprehensive overview of the total number of minutes (in billions) of telephone calls in Australia, categorizing them into local, national, international, and mobile calls. From 2001 to 2008, the data reveals interesting trends and patterns in the usage of different types of telephone calls.Notably, the number of local telephone calls consistently had the largest share from 2001 to 2008. This indicates a strong preference among Australians for making local calls, possibly due to the convenience, affordability, and the necessity of communicating with individuals within the same region. The dominance of local calls in the total call volume suggests that a significant portion of daily communication needs are met through these calls, highlighting the importance of local connectivity in the country.In contrast, national and international calls, as well as mobile calls, show varying levels of usage but do not surpass the volume of local calls during this period. National calls, which connect different parts of the country, and international calls, which link Australia with the rest of the world, are essential for business, education, and personal communications that transcend local boundaries. Mobile calls, representing a newer and more flexible form of communication, also play a crucial role, especially in situations where traditional landline connections are not available or convenient.The data from 2001 to 2008 paints a picture of a society where local communication is paramount, yet there is a growing need for connectivity that goes beyond local borders. Understanding these patterns can be invaluable for telecommunications companies and policymakers seeking to meet the evolving communication needs of the Australian public. By analyzing the preferences and habits of telephone users, service providers can tailor their offerings to better suit the demands of their customers, ultimately enhancing the communication infrastructure of the country.
362;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of how parents in a country spent time taking care of their children in the evening in 2022. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The bar chart demonstrates the proportions in which how parents spent time looking after their kids in the evening in the country, during the year 2022. The figures are given in percentage of time. Overall, there are four activities, including dressing, homework, playing games, and preparing for bed. which can be roughly classified into two groups. On one hand, mothers mainly oversee their children for dressing and homework with some helps from fathers, on the other hand, playing games and preparing for bed are done by both parents. Obviously, fathers spent time significantly less than mothers in all activities.To begin, The proportion of mothers taking care of theri children by dressing was approximately 75 percent which is the majority in the task. Likewise, around a half of homeworks were done by mothers while it was the acitivity which fathers take the most at about 10%.In contrast, both parents mainly took care of their children together to play games and to prepare for bed. Specifically, they both played games with their kids and prepared fot bed around 70 and 50 percent of time respectively. Furthermore, mothers spent 40 percent of time to prepare for bed.;The traditional roles of parents in childcare have undergone significant changes over the years, but some responsibilities still remain divided along traditional lines. When it comes to overseeing children's daily activities, mothers typically take the lead in ensuring their kids are properly dressed and complete their homework. While fathers do lend a hand in these tasks, the primary responsibility often falls on the mothers. This division of labor is reflective of societal norms where mothers are often expected to be the primary caregivers.On the other hand, activities such as playing games with the children and preparing them for bed tend to be more shared responsibilities between both parents. These tasks allow for quality time and bonding between the children and both their mother and father, promoting a sense of unity and togetherness in the family. Despite this sharing of responsibilities, it's notable that fathers generally spend significantly less time on these activities compared to mothers.The disparity in time spent on childcare activities between mothers and fathers can be attributed to various factors, including work schedules and societal expectations. Mothers often have more flexible schedules or work part-time, allowing them to dedicate more hours to childcare. Additionally, the societal norm of mothers being the primary caregivers can influence the distribution of childcare responsibilities, with mothers shouldering more of the burden.However, it's essential to recognize the importance of both parents being involved in their children's lives. Shared parenting responsibilities not only distribute the workload more evenly but also provide children with diverse perspectives, skills, and emotional support. As we move forward, it's crucial to challenge traditional norms and strive for a more balanced approach to childcare, where both mothers and fathers can actively participate and contribute equally to their children's upbringing. By doing so, we can foster healthier, more balanced families and society as a whole.
626;The bar chart shows the percentage of the total world population in 4 countries in 1950 and 2002, and projections for 2050.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart depicts the proportion of the total world population in 4 countries in 1950 and 2002, and predictions for 2050. Overall, it can be seen India and China occupy much higher percentage in all periods while the USA, and Japan tend to be much smaller and drop down in 2002.It is clear that India steadily increases the percentage of its population since 1950. Specifically, the percentage in each period is 15 percent, around 17 percent, and will be approximately 18 percent, in 1950, 2002, and 2050 respectively. In contrast, China used to be the highest percentage of population in 1950 and 2002. The each percentage indicates more than 23 percent in 1950 and dropped to 20 percent in 2002. Furthermore, the prediction about population will plummet to 15 percent.Interestingly, firstly Japan was the smallest percentage in 4 countries in 1950 and slightly goes down in 2002. The percentage seems to be about 4 percent in 1950 and its percentage will plummet to approximately 1 percent in 2050. The USA also goes down population 5 percent in 2002, but the percentage will stay the same in 2050.;The bar chart provided offers a striking visual representation of the proportion of the total world population residing in four major countries: India, China, the USA, and Japan. The data spans three significant years: 1950, 2002, and includes a predictive outlook for 2050. A cursory glance at the chart reveals a dominant trend - India and China consistently occupy a much higher percentage of the global population across all periods, while the USA and Japan constitute a significantly smaller proportion, with a noticeable decline in their percentages by 2002.In 1950, India and China already accounted for a substantial portion of the world's population, reflecting their historical positions as the most populous countries. This trend continues into 2002, with both nations experiencing an increase in their population proportions. Notably, China's proportion surpasses that of India, underscoring the vast scale of its population. Conversely, the USA and Japan exhibit markedly smaller percentages, indicative of their relatively smaller population sizes compared to the Asian giants.The predictive data for 2050 suggests that this trend will persist. India is anticipated to surpass China in terms of population proportion, a development that aligns with demographic forecasts suggesting India's population will exceed China's in the coming decades. Meanwhile, the proportions attributed to the USA and Japan are expected to decline further, underscoring the aging populations and lower birth rates characteristic of these developed nations.The implications of these demographic shifts are profound, with potential impacts on global economic patterns, resource allocation, and geopolitical dynamics. As the world's population continues to grow, albeit at a slowing rate, the concentration of population in countries like India and China will increasingly influence global agendas, from climate change mitigation to economic development strategies. In conclusion, the bar chart paints a clear picture of a world where India and China are increasingly dominant in terms of population, while the USA and Japan, though significant in other aspects, play a lesser role in sheer numerical terms.
1136;The bar chart shows the scores of teams A, B and C over four different seasons.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The graphic gives information about the scores obtained by three teams (A, B and C) in four seasons. Team B compared to the other two is that obtained more points over the years. On the other hand, teams A and B mantain their scores low. 2004 is the year in which there is less discrepancy in the scores of the three teams. Instead, in 2002 there is more disparity.Over the years the three teams always modify their score. The score of each of the teams rises and then goes down. For instance, the scores of team A is that subjected to more modifications. It start very low. In 2003 were registered an increase and then the points rapidly go up in 2003. The scores changed from 11 points to 35. After that, the points start to diminish again. Team B obtained always the highest scores over the years. However also this team's score is subject to various change. The score was very high in 2002 and is just 43 in 2004. In 2005 the score raises again. Team C totalise the lowest score over the years, and the scores are subjected just to small variations.2004 is the year in which there is less disparity between the score of team B and the other two. Team A in 2004 had totalised 35 point and team B only 8 point more. Even if the points of team C are 12, the overall score's dicrepancy is less than in other year. Indeed, in 2002 there is a huge dicrepancy concerning the scores of the teams. Team B obtained 82 points while the other two teams obtained respectively 5 points (team A) and 10 points (team B).;The graphic provided offers a comprehensive overview of the scores obtained by three teams, A, B, and C, over four seasons. Upon analyzing the data, it becomes evident that the performance of these teams varies significantly from one season to another. A key observation from the graphic is the disparity in scores among the teams across different years.One of the most notable aspects of the data is the consistency and closeness of scores among the teams in the year 2004. This year stands out as the one with the least discrepancy in the scores of the three teams. The scores of teams A, B, and C in 2004 are remarkably close, indicating a highly competitive season where each team performed at a similar level. This suggests that the year 2004 was exceptionally competitive, with minimal difference in the performance of the teams, possibly due to balanced team strengths, strategic plays, or other factors that led to such a tight competition.In stark contrast, the year 2002 presents a completely different scenario. The graphic clearly shows that 2002 was the year with the most disparity in the scores among the teams. The significant gap in scores between the top-performing team and the others indicates a lack of competitive balance that year. Several factors could contribute to such disparity, including differences in team preparation, player skills, or strategic advantages held by one team over the others.The variation in performance and the resultant disparities in scores over the years highlight the dynamic nature of team competition. Factors such as team dynamics, training regimens, and strategic planning play crucial roles in determining the outcomes of each season. The graphic serves as a testament to the unpredictability and excitement inherent in competitive team sports, where each season brings new challenges and opportunities for teams to excel. By examining the scores over the four seasons, one can gain insights into the factors that contribute to a team's success and the elements that make for a truly competitive season.
272;The bar charts below show the number of hours each teacher spent teaching in different schools in four different countries in 2001.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar graph illustrates the amount of teaching hours of teacher in primary, lower secondary and upper secondary schools in Japan, Spain, Iceland and the USA. It's clearly can seen the teacher who teach higher students spend time to teach more than lower.In european countries, their teacher have to teach nearly hours in upper secondary schools at 900 hours. Thus, Iceland and Spain still has big gap in primary and lower secondary schools. The teacher in primary schools in Iceland spend almost 600 hours which shorter time than Spain (more than 600 hours). Same way in lower secondary schools, Iceland and Spain teacher spend 600 and 750 hours, respectively.In other countries, teachers in Japan spend the smallest time of four countries in average at 600, 625 and 650 hours. In the USA, teachers spend the largest time of teaching at 625, 950 and almost 1200 hours in primary lower secondary and upper secondary schools.;The bar graph provided offers a comparative analysis of the teaching hours of teachers across different educational levels in Japan, Spain, Iceland, and the USA. At a glance, it is evident that there is a significant disparity in the amount of time teachers spend teaching, with those instructing higher-level students logging more hours than their counterparts teaching lower-level students.In all four countries, a clear trend emerges where teachers at the upper secondary level spend the most time teaching, followed by those at the lower secondary level, and then primary school teachers. This progression suggests that as students advance in their educational journey, the demand for more specialized and in-depth instruction increases, necessitating longer teaching hours.For instance, in Japan, the teaching hours progressively increase from primary to upper secondary levels, indicating a structured approach to education where the complexity and depth of curriculum content require more instructional time as students mature. Similarly, in Spain and Iceland, the pattern holds, with upper secondary teachers dedicating significantly more hours to teaching compared to their primary and lower secondary counterparts.The USA also follows this trend, though the differential between the teaching hours at different educational levels may vary slightly compared to the other countries. This consistency across different educational systems underscores the global recognition of the need for more extensive and specialized teaching as students reach higher levels of education.This pattern has implications for educational policy and resource allocation. It highlights the need for a balanced approach to teacher workload, ensuring that teachers across all levels have the support and resources needed to provide quality education, regardless of the student's educational stage. Ultimately, the graph presents a compelling visual argument for the strategic allocation of teaching resources, mirroring the increasing complexity and demands of higher-level education.
314;The bar charts below shows the number of visits to a community website in the first and second year of use.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and mae comparisons with relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the quantity of visits by the thousands paid to a community website within the first two years of use.Overall, there is a greater upward trend from the second year of use compared to the first year of use. In addition to that, in both years the website undergoes a drastic fluctuation in numbers. It can be observed that initially in the month of September, number of visits in the first year of use are lower than second year of use, but numbers of the former subsequently surpasses the latter in the final month of August.In regards to the first year of use, quantity of visits increases from about 2000 visits in September to 10000 visits within 2 months and remains constant for another month. Following that, numbers plummet from December to February, reaching a low-point of less than approximately 500 visits. The numbers rise gradually from February onwards until it reaches it's highest at 15000 by August.On the other hand, during the second year of use, the number of visits rises sharply from about 2500 visits to around 17500 visits. Soon, the visits dip to 10000 only by February, persisting to March. The trend then increases steadily until it touches roughly 22500 visits in July, but drops once again to less than 13000.;The bar chart provides a visual representation of the quantity of visits paid to a community website over its first two years of operation. A notable observation from the chart is the drastic fluctuation in the number of visits that occurred in both years. This volatility suggests that the website's popularity and usage were subject to significant variations over the period.An interesting trend emerges when comparing the first and second years of the website's operation. Initially, in September, the number of visits recorded in the first year was lower than that in the second year. This could indicate a growth in the website's user base or an increase in its popularity over time. However, this trend does not hold consistent throughout the two years.A striking reversal occurs as the months progress, culminating in August of the second year. By this final month, the number of visits to the website in the first year surpasses those in the second year. This unexpected shift could be attributed to various factors, such as changes in user preferences, updates to the website, or external events that influenced user engagement.The drastic fluctuations and the eventual surpassing of visits in the first year over the second year by August underscore the dynamic nature of the website's usage patterns. They highlight the importance of continuous monitoring and adaptation to user needs and preferences to maintain a consistent and growing user base. Overall, the bar chart presents a complex picture of the community website's usage over its first two years, with both promising growth and unexpected declines that warrant further analysis and strategic planning.
1408;The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise age limit for the younger drivers and to lower age limit for the aged ones. Do you agree?;With the rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the with hush and rush lifestyles of drivers today, traffic accidents seem to be escalating in our society. partly to number of traffic accidents but surely not as the main factor.Those who agree with would view young drivers assuming under 18 years old and older drivers to be reckless and therefore would be more prone to traffic accidents on the road. Lack of experience, forgetfulness, carelessness and poor fitness condition may be reasons for limiting age of drivers.On the other hand, I would think that age is only a small determinant and we need to look at more effective measure such as reducing number of vehicles on the road through car pool, implementing more stringent regulations on alcohol drink driving and possibly to revise on the standard of driving test for young and old drivers on the road. Many drivers who are stuck in traffic jams also have busy lifestyles and therefore tend to become very stressed or distracted on the road. Thus I would think the government may have to look ways to improve road infrastructure and traffic jams to deter or reduce accidents on the road.To sum up, age is only one of the many contributors for accidents but I do not agree that age for the elderly and raising age limit for the younger drivers is the best method. As mentioned in my third paragraph, we need to look at other more effective measures which deal with the underlying problems in the society which lead to traffic accidents.;The debate on whether age is a significant contributor to accidents on the road has sparked intense discussion. While it is true that age can play a role in accidents, with the elderly and young drivers being more prone to mistakes, it is not the sole determining factor. Many other elements, such as driving experience, health, and road conditions, also contribute to the likelihood of accidents.Some argue that raising the age limit for elderly drivers and increasing the minimum age requirement for young drivers would reduce the number of accidents on the road. However, I strongly disagree with this approach. Implementing age-based restrictions would not only be unfair but also ineffective in reducing accidents. For instance, many elderly drivers are still capable of driving safely and responsibly, while some younger drivers may be more reckless and prone to accidents despite being below the proposed age limit.Moreover, such restrictions would not address the root causes of accidents, which often involve a combination of factors such as driver error, vehicle malfunction, and environmental conditions. Instead of focusing on age, it would be more beneficial to implement measures that promote safe driving practices, such as regular driver training and education programs, stricter vehicle maintenance standards, and improved road infrastructure.Furthermore, raising the age limit for young drivers may also have unintended consequences, such as limiting their mobility and independence. Many young people rely on driving to get to work, school, or other essential activities, and restricting their ability to drive could have a significant impact on their daily lives. Therefore, rather than relying solely on age-based restrictions, a more comprehensive approach that takes into account multiple factors and promotes safe driving practices is needed to reduce accidents on the road.
1414;The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise the age limit for younger drivers and to lower the age limit for aged drivers. Do you agree ?;Traffic accidents are on the rise these days. Most of the accidents injuries or death. Research have found that most of the accidents are caused by inexperienced drivers, for example young drivers.Young drivers tend to be more daring and are unable to avoid a crush when they face one. They tend to be more daring after drinking alcohol at night and this causes them to lose control of the car. Drunk driving will not only risk a person’s own life but may also cause an life to be lost.The government should encourage the driving to conduct driving lessons for drivers for a longer period. This will give them a clear picture about how accidents happen and teach them about the safety of others on the road. Drivers that have been in an accident after drunk driving should be from driving for at least two years and be given driving lessons again.However, for the aged drivers, the government should not only the age limit but also check the capability of the aged drivers for instance eyesight, hearing and other related health conditions to ensure safe driving. It does not mean that an aged person not fit to drive and has a problem with the heart but a young or a middle aged person could also have heart failure these days.To conclude, I feel that to raise the of young drivers not the best solution but to about the problems they may encounter on the road and to ban them from driving if they have caused an accident due to carelessness. As for the drivers, as long as they are capable on the road before a certain age and there are no health issues there shouldn’t be a problem.;The alarming rise in traffic accidents has become a pressing concern in recent years. A significant proportion of these accidents can be attributed to inexperienced drivers, particularly young drivers who lack the necessary skills and judgment to navigate the roads safely. To mitigate this trend, the government should take proactive measures to enhance the driving abilities of novice drivers.One effective way to achieve this is by extending the period of mandatory driving lessons. Currently, many young drivers are allowed to obtain their licenses after a relatively short period of training, which often proves insufficient to equip them with the necessary skills to handle complex driving situations. By increasing the duration of driving lessons, novice drivers will have more time to practice and hone their skills, reducing the likelihood of accidents caused by inexperience.Furthermore, the government should also implement stricter penalties for drivers who engage in reckless behavior, such as drunk driving. Drivers who are involved in accidents while under the influence of alcohol should face severe consequences, including a minimum two-year ban from driving. This would serve as a deterrent to would-be offenders and also protect other road users from the risk of being involved in an accident with a reckless driver.In conclusion, the rising incidence of traffic accidents necessitates urgent action from the government to address the root causes of these accidents. By extending the period of driving lessons and imposing stricter penalties for reckless driving, the government can significantly reduce the number of accidents on our roads. This, in turn, will save lives, reduce injuries, and make our roads safer for all users. It is imperative that the government takes a proactive approach to address this issue and ensure that our roads are safe for everyone.
31;The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;These days it is firmly believed that the most efficient method to teach children in schools how to work together is through team sports. This essay disagrees with the statement since some young students might not enjoy playing sports and because team sports can raise competitiveness amongst children, hence having a negative impact on their friendly relationships.First of all, although it is vital for a children to play sports and keep fit, not everyone is keen on football, rugby and volleyball. Instead, some young students prefer spending their leisure time on other activities such as joining a chorus group or teathre lessons. These activities can encourage cooperation and make children get along with each other, as well. On the other hand, forcing children to play something they doesn't feel comfortable in can make them withdraw from the team game, which would make them feel excluded.In addition, teams sports do not always promote cooperation among players. In some cases, inequities or particularly ambitious behaviours can lead to violent competitiveness, instead. It is generally thought that sport is an extremely selective environment, in fact you need to exercise daily in order to keep fit. If obese children took part in those team sports as well, they could feel isolated because they do not own the perfect body to perform well.In conclusion, although team sports are a great method to teach children how to get along with each other, there are various activities which can encourage cooperation among children, as well. Therefore, it is considerably significant for a school to embrace diversity and make children play with what they really like, instead of forcing them to do something they feel they don't belong.;The notion that all young students should be encouraged to participate in team sports has been a topic of debate among educators and parents. However, this essay disagrees with the statement that all young students should participate in team sports. One of the primary reasons for this disagreement is that some young students might not enjoy playing sports. Every child is unique and has different interests, and forcing them to participate in an activity they do not enjoy can lead to a negative experience.Moreover, team sports can raise competitiveness amongst children, which can be detrimental to their emotional well-being. The emphasis on winning can lead to an unhealthy obsession with success, causing children to become overly aggressive and stressed. This can be particularly damaging for young children who are still developing their self-esteem and confidence. Forcing children to participate in team sports can also make them feel pressured to perform, which can lead to anxiety and a fear of failure.Additionally, forcing children to play something they don't feel comfortable with can make them withdraw from the team game altogether. This can lead to social isolation and a lack of physical activity, which can have long-term negative consequences for their physical and mental health. Instead of forcing children to participate in team sports, educators and parents should encourage them to explore different activities and find what they truly enjoy. This approach will help children develop a positive relationship with physical activity and team sports, which can lead to a lifelong commitment to health and wellness. In conclusion, while team sports can have numerous benefits, it is essential to consider the individual interests and needs of each child, rather than forcing them to participate in an activity they may not enjoy.
982;The chart and table below give information about population figures in Japan.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar graph and table provide information about population numbers of past, present and future in Japan from in the year of 1950 to 2055. It can be observed that numbers of total population and elderly people changes between these years.Overall, Japan's population rose until 2005 and drops from that point as future prediction indicates. Likewise, the population of aged 65 or over rose until certain point.Taking a closer look at the graph, it can be seen that population is increased regularly from 1950 to 2005. While it was 84.1 millions in the year 1950, it is peaked in 2005 with reaching 127.8 millions. However, it will decrease from 2005 to 2055 with reaching 89.9 millions.On the other hand, if we look at the table, we can see that elderly people's population rose from 4.1 millions in 1950 to 25.7 million in 2005. The increase is expected until 2035 with predicting to reach 37.2 millions, however, it would drop to 36.5 millions in 2055.;The bar graph and table provided offer a comprehensive overview of the population trends in Japan, spanning from 1950 to 2055. Upon examining the data, it becomes evident that significant changes have occurred and are projected to continue in the numbers of the total population and the elderly population over the years.Historically, from 1950 onwards, Japan experienced a notable increase in its total population, reaching its peak in the late 20th century. However, the data indicates that this trend began to reverse, with the total population starting to decline. This shift is attributed to a combination of factors, including a low birth rate and an aging population. The bar graph clearly illustrates this decline, showing a downward trend in the total population from its peak onwards.Conversely, the population of elderly individuals in Japan has shown a starkly different trend. The table reveals a steady and significant increase in the number of elderly people as a proportion of the total population. This phenomenon is largely due to advancements in healthcare and living standards, leading to increased life expectancy, coupled with the decreased birth rate which alters the demographic balance. By 2055, the projections suggest that the elderly population will constitute a substantial portion of Japan's total population, underscoring the challenges associated with an aging society, including strain on pension systems, healthcare, and social support structures.The implications of these demographic changes are far-reaching. Japan will need to adapt its social, economic, and healthcare policies to accommodate the needs of an aging population, while also addressing the issue of a declining workforce. Strategies to encourage higher birth rates or to attract foreign workers may become necessary to mitigate the effects of these population trends. In conclusion, the data presented in the bar graph and table highlight the critical demographic shifts Japan is facing, emphasizing the need for proactive measures to manage the challenges and opportunities presented by an aging and declining population.
664;The chart below gives information about global population percentages and distribution of wealth by region.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The chart indicates information about global population percentages and distribution of wealth by eight regions. Clearly, three regions contribute to global wealth remarkably higher than others, while the five regions' distribution of wealth is all less than five percent.To begin with, these three regions, North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacefic can be seen much high percentage. Specifically, it is close to 35 percent, 30 percent, and nearly 25 percent, in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacefic respectively. Noticeable point is that North America's population is the sixth highest. In contrast, the distribution of wealth percentage reached a peak of nearly 35 percent.Secondly, China has the highest population. Specifically, it is close to a quarter, while the second and third countries have approximately 15 percent. In contrast, the distribution of wealth is not so larger than other countries. Although Europe's population is 15 percent and the distribution of wealth is 30 percent, the percentage of distribution of wealth in China is approximately three percent. This is only one-tenths, compared with Europe. Another noteworthy point is Latin America and Caribean. This is the only region the percentage of the population and global wealth is not significantly wide. It is more than six percentage of the population and around four percentage of global wealth.;The global wealth distribution is a phenomenon that has been a subject of interest for many economists and researchers. It is evident that certain regions contribute significantly more to global wealth than others. Notably, North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region stand out as the highest contributors to global wealth, accounting for a substantial percentage of the world's total wealth.Among these regions, the Asia-Pacific region is particularly noteworthy, with China being a major driver of wealth creation. As the most populous country in the world, China's massive population of over 1.4 billion people is a significant factor in its wealth generation. However, despite its large population, the distribution of wealth within China is not as skewed as one might expect. In fact, the wealth distribution in China is relatively more evenly spread compared to other countries.In contrast to China, many other countries exhibit a more pronounced wealth disparity. For instance, countries in South America and Africa often have a smaller percentage of the global wealth, with a larger proportion of their population living below the poverty line. This stark difference in wealth distribution highlights the need for more equitable economic policies and strategies to reduce poverty and promote sustainable development.The disparity in global wealth distribution is a complex issue, influenced by a multitude of factors including economic systems, government policies, and access to education and resources. Understanding the factors that contribute to the wealth of regions like North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific is crucial in addressing the pressing issue of global wealth inequality. By recognizing the successes and challenges of these regions, we can work towards creating a more balanced and equitable global economy. Ultimately, a more balanced distribution of wealth is essential for promoting global economic stability, peace, and prosperity.
504;The chart below shows global sales of the top five mobile phone brands between 2009 and 2013.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar chart below indicates mobile phone market share for the best five different brands Samsung, Apple, Nokia, LG and ZTE between 2009 and 2013. The best two brands were Samsung and Nokia, more than 400 annually. The others were below less than 150 in the same period of time.In 2009, Nokia has reached almost 450 when the second best brand Samsung was lower than 250. The sales of Samsung soared to the top in 2013 when Nokia slipped down to 250 in the same year. The biggest drop of Nokia presented between 2011 and 2013 from over 400 to 250.The apple's market share was in the fifth position with no more than 50 in 2009. It has a similar trend like Samsung however in 2013 it has 150 sales. LG and ZTE were the relative small portion compared to Samsung and Nokia. The ZTE was improving slowly when LG was losing its market share every year.;The mobile phone market has experienced significant fluctuations in market share among various brands over the years. According to the bar chart provided, the period between 2009 and 2013 saw a notable trend in the market share of the top five brands: Samsung, Apple, Nokia, LG, and ZTE.During this time frame, Samsung and Nokia emerged as the dominant players in the market, with each selling more than 400 units annually. These two brands consistently outperformed their competitors, showcasing their strong market presence and consumer preference. Samsung, in particular, demonstrated impressive sales figures, solidifying its position as a leader in the mobile phone industry. Nokia, on the other hand, maintained its loyal customer base, ensuring a substantial market share.In contrast, the other three brands - Apple, LG, and ZTE - struggled to gain significant traction in the market. Each of these brands sold less than 150 units annually, indicating a relatively weak presence in the market. Apple, despite being a well-known brand, failed to make a significant impact during this period. LG and ZTE, similarly, were unable to gain substantial market share, trailing far behind Samsung and Nokia.The significant disparity in sales figures between the top two brands and the rest of the competition highlights the intense competition in the mobile phone market. The dominance of Samsung and Nokia can be attributed to their innovative products, effective marketing strategies, and strong distribution networks.

1128;The chart below shows numbers of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles travelled (PMT) by transportation type in 2002.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The chart illustrates numbers of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles travelled in 2002. It is divided into five transportation type: by commuter rail, by heavy rail, by light rail, by bus and by demand response.Overall, we notice the highest number of incident and injuries is due to transportation by demand response, while the use of commuter rail has the lowest number of these accidents. The number of injuries is lower than incident in all cases.In the case of commuter rail, the number of incidents which represents less than 30 incidents per 100 million PMT is almost equal to the number of injuries. The graph shows some similarities when we use light rail or bus, especially in regards of incidents. The numbers of incidents in both cases are about 75 incidents per 100 million PMT. However, the number of injuries increases from approximately 40 to 60 injuries per 100 million PMT. The transportation by demand response is responsible of more than 250 incidents and 150 injuries per 100 million PMT.;The chart provided offers valuable insights into the safety records of various transportation modes in 2002, with a specific focus on incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles traveled. Upon examining the data, it becomes clear that transportation by demand response has the highest number of incidents and injuries among all the options presented.Demand response transportation, which includes services like taxis and car-sharing services that operate on a non-fixed route basis, tops the list with the highest rates of both incidents and injuries. This suggests that the nature of demand response transportation, which often involves unpredictable routes and schedules, may contribute to a higher risk of accidents. The exact reasons for these higher rates could be multifaceted, including factors such as driver behavior, the condition of vehicles, and the lack of a fixed, monitored route.One consistent trend across all transportation modes illustrated in the chart is that the number of injuries is significantly lower than the number of incidents. This disparity indicates that while incidents may occur frequently, many of them are fortunate enough to not result in physical harm to the passengers. This could be due to various safety measures in place, such as the use of safety belts, robust vehicle design, and perhaps the swift response of emergency services in the event of an incident.Understanding these statistics is crucial for both policymakers and the general public. It can inform decisions on how to allocate resources to improve safety, where to focus safety campaigns, and how to design safer transportation systems. Furthermore, awareness of these risks can guide individuals in choosing their mode of transportation, potentially opting for safer alternatives when possible.In conclusion, the data presented in the chart underscores the importance of safety in transportation, highlighting the vulnerabilities of certain modes of travel. It serves as a call to action for improving safety standards, particularly in demand response transportation, to reduce the gap between incidents and injuries, aiming for a future where all modes of transportation can be considered safe for everyone.
1072;The chart below shows the amount of leisure time enjoyed by men and women of different employment status.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar chart illustrates the information about how long male people and female people spent their time on leisure activities according to the sorts of job.Overall, it is clear that, the majority of those who retire their occupation or are not in employment, spent most of the time on leisure activities. Plus, male people were inclined to enjoy more time on chilling activities than females.Looking at the males in more detail, the figures for retired or unemployed male guys showed the highest range with over 80 hours in a week, meanwhile, other guys who obtained full-time job spent approximately 42 hours per week.With regard to women, most of them who finished their working life or were not yet to be employed had just under 80 hours for leisure time in every week, but there were just roughly 40 hours which was spent by women who were in charge hosewives, full-time job and part-time employment.;The bar chart provides a clear insight into the amount of time male and female individuals spend on leisure activities, depending on their occupation. A notable trend emerges, where males tend to devote more hours to leisure pursuits compared to their female counterparts. Upon examining the data, it becomes apparent that males are more inclined to enjoy leisure activities, with a significant disparity in the time allocated to these pursuits. This disparity is consistent across various job categories, suggesting an inherent difference in how males and females prioritize their free time.Looking specifically at the male demographic, it is striking to note that retired or unemployed males exhibit the highest range of leisure time, with an impressive total exceeding 80 hours per week. This substantial allocation of time to leisure activities can be attributed to the absence of professional commitments, allowing these individuals to focus on personal interests and hobbies. In contrast, female individuals in similar situations do not demonstrate the same level of engagement in leisure activities, hinting at different priorities or responsibilities that may occupy their time.The findings of the bar chart underscore a significant difference in leisure time utilization between males and females, as well as among different occupational groups. The data suggests that factors such as employment status and gender play a pivotal role in determining how individuals allocate their time to leisure activities. Further exploration into the underlying reasons for these disparities could provide valuable insights into societal norms, personal preferences, and the evolving nature of work-life balance.

96;The chart below shows the expenditure on three categories among different age groups of residents in the UK in 2004.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of total allocation of expenses in three major categories among the citizens of the United Kingdom from five different age groups in the year 2004.Overall, the spending on food and drink continuously increased as the residents reached the older ages. Moreover, spending on entertainment activities also incresased but declined when reaching the later age, while going to a restaurant and hotel was its peak during early age and its lowest was upon reaching the retirement age.Food and drink are part of our daily necessisties, and as a family member grows in number, the more food and drink a family consumed. Over other categories, food and drink are more essential and priority of every residents as the total spending of it increased every fifteen years. This explains why the total expenditure of residents in the UK is mostly on food and drink. From age under 30 with almost 7% only, it sharply increased up to 23% in age 76 and above.In addition, expenses on entertainment reached its peak level of 23%, the same percentage with food and drink but in different age goup, in 61 to 75. In this stage, people already reached the retirement age wherein entertainment activities became a hobby while still having energy. But upon reaching 76 years and above, it declined to just 13%. However, expenditure in eating on a restaurant and staycation on a hotel were high with 14% under 30 years of age, while it dramatically decreased to below 3% upon reaching 61 to 75 years of age.;The bar chart provides a clear insight into the allocation of expenses among citizens of the United Kingdom, categorized by age group in the year 2004. A notable trend emerges, highlighting the significance of food and drink as essential expenses across all age groups. This category surpasses other expenditure categories, demonstrating its priority in the budgets of UK residents.A closer examination of the data reveals a consistent increase in the allocation for food and drink every fifteen years, indicating a long-term trend where this category continues to gain importance in household budgets. This pattern suggests that, regardless of age, the expenditure on food and drink remains a constant and growing priority.The persistence of this trend across different age groups underscores the fundamental nature of food and drink expenses. As basic necessities, they are less susceptible to fluctuations based on age or potentially other demographic factors. In contrast, other categories of expenses may vary significantly across age groups due to differing priorities and lifestyle choices.The data from 2004 reinforces the idea that food and drink are foundational elements of personal budgets, with their allocation either stable or increasing over time. This stability in expenditure patterns, particularly for something as essential as food and drink, points to a broader economic and societal constant in the UK, where the priority on basic sustenance remains unwavering.In conclusion, the bar chart's illustration of expense allocations in the UK in 2004 clearly shows that food and drink are prioritized expenses across various age groups. The observed increase in spending on these essentials every fifteen years highlights their enduring importance in the financial planning of UK citizens, positioning them as a core, unchanging aspect of personal and national economic behaviors.

1100;The chart shows the number of mobile phones and landlines per 100 people in selected countries.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information given.;The bar chart illustrates the information on the number of people who are using mobile phones and landlines per 100 people in 7 different countries.Overall, the total number of mobile phones per 100 people are higher than land line. Among the countries, Italy is one of the country that uses the highest number of mobile phones per 100 people.More specifically, 90 phones are used per 100 people in Italy, followed by Sweden and the UK at close to 90 and 85 phones respectively. From the figure, mobile phones were least popular in Canada, approximately 40 per cent of the people carry mobile phones which the percentage of mobile phone users are lower than one-half users in Italy.On the other hand, land lines are mostly loved in Denmark at 85 and 90 per cent. However, most other countries remain between 55 to 70 per cent. Interestingly, Italy has the least proportion of users having just over 40 phones per 100 people.;The advent of mobile phones has revolutionized the way people communicate, and their popularity has been on the rise globally. However, there are some countries where mobile phones are less popular. Interestingly, Canada is one such country where mobile phones have been slow to gain traction. According to recent data, approximately 40 per cent of the population in Canada carries mobile phones, which is relatively low compared to other developed nations.Despite this, the overall number of mobile phones per 100 people in Canada is higher than the number of landlines. This suggests that while mobile phones may not be as widely used as in other countries, they are still a preferred mode of communication for many Canadians. The lower adoption rate of mobile phones in Canada can be attributed to various factors, including the country's vast geography and limited network coverage in some areas.In contrast, some countries have an even lower proportion of mobile phone users. Italy, for instance, is one of the countries with the least proportion of users. This may seem surprising, given Italy's strong economy and high standard of living. However, it highlights the varying rates of mobile phone adoption across different countries and regions.The lower popularity of mobile phones in certain countries can be attributed to various factors, including cultural preferences, infrastructure, and economic conditions. Nevertheless, the global trend suggests that mobile phones are becoming an increasingly essential tool for communication, and their popularity is likely to continue growing in the future. As technology advances and network coverage improves, it is expected that more people in countries like Canada and Italy will adopt mobile phones, bridging the gap with other nations where mobile phones are already an integral part of daily life.
414;The chart shows the unemployment situation in Australia in the year 2012.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The line chart compared the percentage of people unemployed in Australian rural and urban areas in 2012. Overall, the two kinds of areas presented the opposite trends through the four quarters, with the number in urban areas rising and that of rural areas declining.Urban areas witnessed a considerable fluctuation throughout the whole timeframe. At the start of the first quater, unemployment rate in urban areas started low at slightly over 2%. The percentage climbed steadily and reached its first peak at the end of the second season at about 4%. However, it dropped to the start point again during the third, and continued to rise after that, closing the year at another new record at nearly 5%.On the other hand, rural areas demonstrated a more consistent change. Beginning significantly higher than urban areas at around 6.5%, its unemployment rate dropped to only 4.5% after the first two seasons. Although there were some fluctuations, the gap between rural and urban areas gradually narrowed down. The final unemployment rate for rural areas was 5%, decreasing by 1.5% compared to the start.;The line chart provided a comparative analysis of the percentage of people unemployed in Australian rural and urban areas throughout 2012. Upon examining the data, it becomes evident that the two types of areas exhibited opposite trends across the four quarters of the year. Urban areas, in particular, demonstrated a considerable fluctuation in unemployment rates throughout the entire timeframe. This volatility suggests that the urban job market was highly sensitive to various economic factors, potentially including seasonal changes, policy adjustments, or shifts in industry demands. The fluctuations observed in urban areas could be attributed to the diverse range of industries and sectors present in these regions, which are more prone to economic fluctuations compared to their rural counterparts.In contrast, rural areas presented a relatively stable trend, although the specifics of this trend are not detailed, it is clear that it moved in the opposite direction of the urban trend. This stability could be due to the nature of industries commonly found in rural areas, such as agriculture, which may experience more predictable seasonal variations. The difference in trends between urban and rural areas underscores the diverse economic and employment conditions existing across different regions within Australia.The comparison highlights the importance of considering geographical location when analyzing employment trends and formulating policies aimed at reducing unemployment. Policymakers must take into account the unique challenges and opportunities present in both urban and rural settings to develop effective strategies. By understanding these trends, targeted interventions can be designed to address the specific needs of each area, ultimately contributing to a more balanced and equitable employment landscape across Australia. Overall, the data from 2012 suggests a complex employment situation, with urban and rural areas requiring distinct approaches to manage and reduce unemployment rates.
556;The charts below compare the age structure of the populations of France and India in 1984.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;These bar charts illustrate different ages categories from 0-5 years old to over 70 of people living in France and India during the year of 1984.Overall, France population ages present various percentages not over 4% between males and females, whereas in India with the increase of age the percentages decreased gradually.Firstly, a bulk of population in France from 10-15 to 30-35 age category of males and females had the highest averages with almost 3,5%, whereas from 40-45 to 60-65 reached approximately 2,7%. By contrast it is noticeable that from 70-75 to 80-85 females were around only the half of the total percentage and males no more than 1%.Secondly, In india the highest proportion of population is the young of 0-5 to 15-20 with nearly 7% and 6% respectively. Moreover, the medium categories both males and females that represent the half of the total percentages is 30-35 to 50-55. By contrast, it is clearly seen that the over 60 population reached just no more than 3%.;The bar charts provided offer a fascinating glimpse into the demographic makeup of France and India in 1984, specifically highlighting the distribution of population across different age categories. For France, the charts reveal a relatively balanced distribution of males and females across all age groups, from 0-5 years old to over 70. Notably, the percentage difference between males and females in each age category does not exceed  than 4%. This consistency suggests a stable and balanced population structure in France, with minimal skew towards either gender across the various age ranges.In contrast, the demographic landscape in India presents a different picture. The charts indicate that as age increases, the percentage of the population decreases gradually. This trend is observed in both males and females, although the rate of decrease may vary slightly between the genders. The gradual decline with age suggests that the younger population segments constitute a larger proportion of the total population in India compared to the older segments. This could imply a relatively high birth rate and a population pyramid that is wide at the base, reflecting a large youth population.The comparison between France and India in 1984 highlights significant differences in population demographics. France's balanced age structure, with minimal variation between male and female percentages across all age groups, contrasts with India's structure, which shows a more pronounced decrease in population percentage with increasing age. These differences could be attributed to various factors, including differences in fertility rates, mortality rates, and potentially, lifestyle and healthcare factors. Understanding these demographic trends is crucial for policymakers, as they inform decisions on resource allocation, healthcare provision, and social security planning, among other areas. The insights from these bar charts, therefore, offer valuable perspectives on the demographic profiles of France and India in 1984, underscoring the importance of continued demographic analysis for informed policy-making.
936;The charts below give information about the way in which water was used in different countries in 2000.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;One of the given chart depicts the use of water in the world, in 2000, for Industry, domestic use and Agriculture.The second chart describes the water consumption by countries ( Canada, New Zealand, India and China) for the same three sectors. Units are measured in percentage.Overall, the larger quantity of water use if for Agriculture ( 70% ) followed by the industry ( 22%) and finally the domestic use representing only 8%.Among the four countries, India is the biggest consumer of water for agriculture with 92%, China also has a significant use of water in that sector with 69%. on the other hand water use in Agriculture counts for less than 50% for both New Zealand and Canada ( with 44% and 8 percent respectively).When it comes to industry, Canada is the larger water consumer hiting a high of 80% while the three other countries have small to very small percentage of water use in that field. ( China 22%, New Zealand 10% and India 3%).Finally use of water for domestic purpose represent less than 50% for all 4 countries. New Zealand 46%, Canada 12%, China 9% and India 5% . However it is important to mention taht for New Zealand, consumption of water in represents the larger part of water use.;The distribution of water usage across various sectors is a critical aspect of resource management. Globally, the allocation of water is skewed towards certain industries, with agriculture being the largest consumer. Approximately 70% of the world's freshwater is utilized for agricultural purposes, highlighting the significant role this sector plays in water consumption. This is followed by industrial use, which accounts for around 22% of global water usage. In contrast, domestic use, which includes household and municipal consumption, represents a relatively modest 8%.Among the major countries, India stands out as the biggest consumer of water for agricultural purposes. A staggering 92% of India's water resources are dedicated to farming and irrigation, underscoring the country's heavy reliance on agriculture. This figure not only reflects the importance of agriculture to India's economy but also points to the challenges the country faces in managing its water resources sustainably.The disparity in water usage between agriculture, industry, and domestic sectors has significant implications for water management policies. It suggests that efforts to conserve water and improve efficiency should primarily target agricultural practices, given the sector's overwhelming share of water consumption. Moreover, the high percentage of water used for agriculture in countries like India indicates a need for innovative and water-saving technologies in farming, as well as policies that promote sustainable water use without compromising agricultural output.In conclusion, the predominant use of water for agriculture, followed by industry and then domestic use, outlines the main challenges in water resource management. Countries with high agricultural water usage, such as India, must prioritize sustainable water management practices to ensure the long-term viability of their agricultural sectors and the well-being of their populations. By addressing water consumption patterns and adopting efficient technologies, it is possible to achieve a more balanced and sustainable use of this vital resource.
350;The charts below show the percentage of Australian men and women in three age groups who were employed in 1984, 2001 and 2014.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The charts demonstrate the percentages of men and women aged 15-19, 35-44 and 60-64 working in Australia in 1984, 2001 and 2014.In 1984, the percentage of employed men aged 35-44 was alomst 100%. Similarly, that was the percentage of men aged 35-44 being employed in 2001 and 2014. As for employed men aged 15-19 we can see a slight decrease over the years, in 1984 more than 50% of men aged 15-19 were employed. However, in 2014, the percentage of employed men was exactly 50%. The percentage of men aged 60-64 being employed in 1984 was below 50% and remained similar to 2001. In 2014 we can see an increase in the percentage of workng males aged 60-64.The most obvious trend in the chart of employed women is the increase in employment over the years, especially women aged 35-44.Overall, we can see that the percentage of employed men in Australia hasn't increased as much as the percentage of employed women.;The chart provided offers a fascinating insight into the employment trends of men and women in Australia across different age groups and years. Specifically, it highlights the percentages of men and women aged 15-19, 35-44, and 60-64 who were working in Australia in 1984, 2001, and 2014. One of the most striking patterns that emerge from this data is the significant increase in the employment rates of women over the years.Looking at the chart, it is evident that the most obvious trend among employed women is the consistent rise in their employment percentages across all specified age groups from 1984 to 2014. This trend suggests a positive shift towards greater female participation in the Australian workforce. The increase in employment rates among women can be attributed to various factors, including changes in social attitudes towards women's roles, improvements in education and job opportunities, and policy changes that support women's employment.For instance, among women aged 35-44, there is a noticeable increase in employment rates from 1984 to 2014. This age group is particularly significant as it often includes women who may have taken time off to raise families and are re-entering the workforce. The increase in their employment rates indicates a more supportive environment for women to balance work and family responsibilities.Furthermore, the chart also shows an increase in the employment rates of older women, aged 60-64, indicating that women are not only entering the workforce in greater numbers at younger ages but are also choosing to or being able to remain in employment longer. This reflects broader societal and economic changes, including the raising of retirement ages and the recognition of the value of experienced workers.In conclusion, the chart underscores the progressive increase in women's employment in Australia over the decades, reflecting changing societal norms, economic needs, and policy support. This trend is a positive indicator of gender equality in the workplace and highlights the growing importance of women's contributions to the Australian economy.

The same questionnaire was given to 100 guests in the years 2005 and 2010.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;"The charts illustrate the outcome of a survery conducted among 100 Parkway Hotel's clients about the customer service's quality (from excellent to very poor) in 2005 and 2010.Overall, in this period of 5 years a growth of good and excellent judgements was seen, linked to a fall of the bad ones.In 2005, almost the half of the visitors (45%) judged the service satisfactory.In addition, 14 out of 100 believed that the service provided by the Hotel was good, while only 5/100 thought it was excellent.However, for the 36% it was below the standard level, and in particular for 15 of them it was very poor.In the first decade of 2000 the service was judged above the average by most of the visitors; in fact, 39% said it was good, whereas 28% stated that it was excellent.Furthermore, since 12% outlined a poor quality of the customer service and only 4% a very poor one, a noticeable decrease of bad reviews was seen.";The hotel industry is a competitive market where customer satisfaction is key to success. In 2005, a survey was conducted to assess the quality of service provided by a particular hotel. The results showed that almost half of the visitors, 45%, judged the service as satisfactory. This indicates that the hotel was meeting the expectations of a significant portion of its customers.However, a closer look at the data reveals that only 14 out of 100 visitors believed that the service provided by the hotel was good, while a mere 5 out of 100 thought it was excellent. This suggests that while the hotel was satisfying the basic needs of its customers, it was not exceeding their expectations. The lack of excellence in service is a concern, as it is the exceptional experiences that often lead to customer loyalty and positive word-of-mouth.On the other hand, 36% of the visitors felt that the service was below the standard level, which is a significant minority. Furthermore, 15 out of 100 visitors thought that the service was very poor, indicating a substantial gap in the hotel's service quality. This is a red flag, as poor service can lead to negative reviews, lost business, and a damaged reputation.In conclusion, while the hotel was meeting the basic expectations of its customers, there is room for improvement. The hotel needs to focus on exceeding customer expectations and addressing the concerns of the significant minority who felt that the service was subpar. By doing so, the hotel can increase customer satisfaction, loyalty, and ultimately, its competitiveness in the market. It is essential for the hotel to take these findings seriously and make necessary adjustments to provide exceptional service to its customers.
796;The charts show information concerning speed-camera use, together with statistics on road accidents, for the city of Melbourne.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;These charts depicts the proprtion of using speed- camera and road accidents percentages in Melbourne. It is clear from the graphs that the number of speed- cameras had increaded significantly over the period of 2022 and 2005.According to what is shown, the percentage of accidents was flactuated between 2002 and 2004 until it sharply rised in 2005. on the other hand, the death rate was steady between 2002 and 2003 then it sharply increaded in the period between 2004 and 2005. After that it dropped in 2005. In addition acciedent rate was much higher than the death rate. In 2004, the accident and death perentages increased abviously.To sum up, we could say that, the number of speed- camers in melborn had rised from about 45% to 148% from 2002 and 2005. Also, the accidents rate increaded over the same period of time. while the death rate decreased by 2005.;The implementation of speed cameras in Melbourne has been a topic of debate in recent years. Between 2002 and 2005, the number of speed cameras in the city increased significantly, rising by 148% from the initial figure, which represents a 45% growth rate. This substantial expansion of speed cameras was intended to reduce the number of accidents and fatalities on Melbourne's roads. However, the actual outcomes have been mixed.On the one hand, the accident rate in Melbourne surprisingly increased over the same period of time, despite the increased presence of speed cameras. This suggests that the speed cameras may not be having the desired deterrent effect on drivers, or that other factors are contributing to the rise in accidents. This increase in accidents is a concerning trend, as it indicates that the roads in Melbourne may be becoming more hazardous, rather than safer.On the other hand, the number of fatalities on Melbourne's roads decreased by 2005, which is a positive development. This decline in deaths suggests that the speed cameras, or other road safety initiatives, are having some impact in reducing the severity of accidents, even if they are not preventing them from occurring in the first place. It is possible that the speed cameras are helping to reduce the speed of vehicles, which in turn is reducing the number of fatalities, even if the overall number of accidents is increasing.In conclusion, the data on speed cameras in Melbourne between 2002 and 2005 presents a complex picture. While the increase in speed cameras has not led to a reduction in accidents, it has coincided with a decrease in fatalities. Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of speed cameras on road safety in Melbourne, and to determine the most effective strategies for reducing accidents and saving lives.

The orange bars show the percentages in 1990, and the green bars show the percentages in 2010. The right graph illustrates the percentages of degrees of its cleanliness in those countries. The yellow bars show the percentages in 1990, and the purple bars shows the percentages in 2010.In Australia, 80% of people got supplied with water in 1999, and it increased to nearly 100% in 2020. In South East Asia, less than 40% of people got water supply, and then the percentage in 2010 became doubled.Whereas degrees of its cleanliness, in Australia it was 70 % in 1990, and slightly increased to above 80% in 2010. In contrast, in South East Asia, the number of percentage was 40% in 1990, but it got small drop to below 40%.;The access to clean and safe drinking water is a fundamental human right, and its availability varies greatly across different regions of the world. In Australia, for instance, the water supply coverage has shown a remarkable improvement over the years. As of 1999, approximately 80% of the population had access to a reliable water supply. However, by 2020, this figure had increased dramatically to nearly 100%, indicating a significant achievement in ensuring universal access to water for its citizens.In contrast, the situation in South East Asia presents a starkly different picture. As of the initial assessment, less than 40% of the population in this region had access to a water supply, highlighting a substantial gap in the provision of this essential service. Nevertheless, there has been a notable improvement in the subsequent years. By 2010, the percentage of the population with access to water supply had doubled, signifying a concerted effort and progress in addressing the water supply deficits in the region.These comparative trends underscore the varying degrees of success in expanding water access across different parts of the world.

Continued investment and effort are necessary to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their geographical location, have access to this fundamental necessity for a healthy and dignified life.
426;The charts shows air pollution levels by different causes among four countries in 2021.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the level of air pollution caused by three different sectors namely electricity generation, transport and industry among four countries which are China, America, Japan and Australia in 2021.Overall, it can be seen that China produced the highest amount of the pollution in every sector. Another noticeable point is that all causes in Australia created the pollution at almost the same amount.Looking at the detail, the industry, the transportation and the electricity generation in China generated the pollution level of 80, 70 and a little less than 60 ppm respectively. This pattern also occurred in Japan where the industry ranked first in releasing the pollution (above 40 ppm) and the power generation ranked last (produced around 15 ppm).Furthermore, approximately 60 ppm of the pollution in Australia is arisen from the electricity generation and the industry. This generated pollution of each aforementioned factors accounted for about 30 ppm which is nearly two times less than that of the transport. Focusing further on Australia, all three businesses created the pollution of just below 20 ppm.;The bar chart provides a stark illustration of the levels of air pollution generated by three distinct sectors - electricity generation, transport, and industry - across four countries. A cursory glance at the chart reveals a striking pattern: China stands out as the country with the highest amount of pollution in every sector. This is a concerning trend, given the well-documented negative impacts of air pollution on both human health and the environment.Furthermore, the data suggests that China's pollution levels far surpass those of the other countries included in the study. This disparity is likely due to a combination of factors, including China's large population, rapid industrialization, and reliance on fossil fuels for energy production. The significant contribution of all three sectors to China's overall pollution levels underscores the need for a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach to addressing this issue.In contrast, Australia presents an intriguing case. The chart indicates that the levels of pollution generated by electricity generation, transport, and industry in Australia are remarkably similar. This equivalence suggests that no single sector dominates Australia's pollution profile, making it easier to implement policies that reduce pollution across the board. This could be an opportunity for Australia to adopt a unified approach to mitigating air pollution, potentially serving as a model for other countries to follow.In conclusion, the bar chart offers valuable insights into the air pollution levels attributed to different sectors in four countries. China's prominence as the largest polluter in every sector is a pressing concern that necessitates immediate attention and strategic planning. Meanwhile, Australia's balanced pollution levels across sectors present a unique opportunity for holistic policy-making. As the world grapples with the challenges of environmental sustainability, understanding and addressing air pollution remains a critical step towards a cleaner, healthier future.

433;The dangers of smoking are well known, yet many people continue with this habit.What are the causes of this? How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is very easy to find someone who smokes in today's society. Even though we were taught that smoke is harmful, we see people exhaling this thick fog everyday partly because some people think that it is cool and it can be purchased almost at every store. This essay will discuss deeply about what causes people to smoke and how this issue can be alleviated.Firstly, part of the society believes that it is trendy to smoke. In many pop culture, such as songs, movies, and novels portray smoking possitively. A comedy show that I have seen illustrates one of the character that smokes to be more cool, giving this character an untouchable aura, whilst other characters that did not smoke seem tangible and therefore mundane. Furthermore, cigarettes are easily accessable in any store. A recent study proved that over 80% of those eager to smoke for the first time actually started this behavior because they can buy it from their local shops. The trend from pop culture and the convenience in accessing smoke adds up to the reasons why some people continues with this habit.I believe that there are solutions that can tackle and reduce smoking, beginning with medias should portray smoking to have consequences that are relatable. A movie I have seen showed the protagonist's constant need for cigarette throughout the show. However, in the end when he finally unites with his crush, he develops a severe disease, mainly from his smoking habits, in which he regretted in the end. This method of portraying people who smoke totally made my younger niece scared of smoking. In addition, government should control the accessibility of cigarettes. Policies that result and fewer stores being able to sell cigarettes and increasing tax pricing of smoke of any kind will definitely make smoking less convenient for many people.In conclusion, although many people knew how harmful smoking is, many people think it is cool to smoke and it is convenient and easy to buy. By making smoking less trendy in society and harder to access, I believe that smoking will be less attractive, hence reducing the number of smokers in society.;The perception of smoking as a trendy and desirable habit is a pervasive issue in our society. Many individuals, particularly young people, view smoking as a fashionable and sophisticated activity, largely due to its portrayal in popular culture. Songs, movies, and novels often depict smoking in a positive light, with characters using cigarettes as a symbol of rebellion, independence, or glamour. This glorification of smoking has contributed to its normalization, leading some to believe that it is a desirable and acceptable behavior.Furthermore, the ease of access to cigarettes has also played a significant role in perpetuating this problem. Cigarettes are widely available in stores, making it simple for individuals to purchase and start smoking. The convenience and ubiquity of cigarettes have normalized their use, making it seem like a harmless and everyday activity. However, the reality is that smoking is a serious health hazard, responsible for a significant number of deaths and health problems worldwide.In order to combat this issue, it is essential that the government takes a more proactive role in controlling the accessibility of cigarettes. This can be achieved through measures such as restricting the sale of cigarettes in certain areas, increasing taxes on tobacco products, and implementing stricter regulations on advertising and marketing. By making cigarettes less accessible and less appealing, the government can help to reduce the number of people taking up smoking and encourage those who already smoke to quit. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the government to protect the health and well-being of its citizens, and controlling the accessibility of cigarettes is a crucial step in this process. By doing so, we can work towards creating a healthier and more informed society, where the dangers of smoking are understood and its portrayal in popular culture is no longer glorified.
496;The diagram below show the development of the horse over a period of 40 million years. The evolution of the horse, with particular emphasis on the changing foot structure.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram illustrates the evolution of the horse in terms of their foot structure over a 40 million year period. Overall, the horse's were divided into four stages of development, starting from a period of 40 million years ago until now, with a 10 to 15 million year gap approximation in between.To begin with, 40 million years ago, the Eohippus, which was the first developmental stage of a horse's foot structure was similar to the bone structure of a human's hand. However, they branch out into five toes while travelling on foot. Then, during stage 2 of the horse's foot development, which was 10 million years later, the horse evolved into a Mesohippus. With regards to the structure of its toe, it was reduced from the original five into three. In addition, the middle toe had a larger foot structure compared to other other two.Next, 15 million years later, came the evolution of a Merychippus from a Mesohippus. Similarly, the foot structure was identical to the Mesohippus' horse but did not have the middle toe's length significantly longer than the other two. Although the middle toe was thicker than before, it became more even in terms of its length comparison to its other two toes. Finally, the emergence of the final evolution of the horse in modern days. With regards to the foot structure, it no longer branched out into several toes as it used to be, but is shaped like a tree branch with a rounded bases on the bottom of the foot.;The evolution of the horse is a fascinating phenomenon that has been studied extensively over the years. A diagram illustrating the development of the horse's foot structure over a period of 40 million years provides valuable insights into the transformation of this magnificent creature. According to the diagram, the horse's foot structure 40 million years ago was remarkably similar to the bone structure of a human hand, with five toes. This primitive foot structure was the foundation for the subsequent evolution of the horse.As time progressed, significant changes occurred in the horse's foot structure. Ten million years after its initial formation, the horse evolved into a Mesohippus, a precursor to the modern horse. Notably, the Mesohippus exhibited a reduction in the number of toes from the original five to three. This adaptation was likely a response to environmental pressures, enabling the Mesohippus to navigate its surroundings more efficiently. The reduction in toes also signified a shift towards a more specialized foot structure, paving the way for the development of the modern horse's distinctive hoof.The transformation of the horse's foot structure over millions of years is a testament to the dynamic nature of evolution. As the horse adapted to its environment, its foot structure underwent significant changes, ultimately giving rise to the modern horse's distinctive single hoof. This evolution was likely driven by the need for increased mobility, stability, and efficiency, allowing the horse to thrive in its ecosystem. The study of the horse's evolution, as illustrated by the diagram, offers a compelling example of the complex and ongoing process of species development, highlighting the remarkable diversity and adaptability of life on Earth.
700;The diagram below shows how Olive Oil is manufactured.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information below.;The Olive Oil is manufactured through several ways. First of all, the olives are picked from the trees by the farmers. Then the fresh olives are rinished using the cold water. The machines used are specific and it helps belt to smash the olives. After smashed, the olives become either olive paster or the olive stones. The next step is to put those into a bag with holes. Moving onto the next step, it will be pressed by a certain pressurer. It gives a great amount of weight on the olives so that it can be well pressed. Moreover it will be separated into either oil or water. Then, it will be stored and sold to the consumers. Thus, it is quite apparent that olive oil is manufactured by specific steps. And so more, olive oil is widely used as it is a good source for the chefs when cooking.;The Use of Olive Oil in Cooking: A Valuable Resource for ChefsOlive oil has become an essential ingredient in many cuisines around the world, and its widespread use can be attributed to its numerous benefits and versatility in cooking.

The dried beans are later roasted in a machine then in the blast freezer machine, it's cooled down rapidly. Furthermore, after cooling out they go through a grinding process where they turned into powder, then mixed with high-temperature water after a while, it goes from straining process.We are now arriving at the later process where coffee is now frozen in the refrigerator. In the third last stage, again it goes from the grinding process but this time it is frozen and after this, they put them in a vacuum machine where it evaporates the water from coffee to make them dry.Lastly, the coffee is ready to pack in the jar and ready to sell on the market.;The production and preparation of coffee for sale in supermarkets and shops is a complex process that involves several stages. As illustrated in the diagram, coffee undergoes a total of 11 distinct stages from the initial picking of the beans to the final packing in jars.The journey of coffee begins with the picking of coffee beans, which is the first stage of the process. This is followed by pulping, where the outer skin of the beans is removed. The beans then undergo fermentation, which breaks down the mucilage, a sticky substance that covers the beans. After fermentation, the beans are washed to remove any remaining pulp and mucilage.The next stage is drying, where the beans are dried to a moisture level of around 11%. This is followed by hulling, where the dried skin of the beans is removed. The beans are then sorted and graded according to size and quality. The seventh stage is roasting, where the beans are roasted to bring out the unique flavors and aromas of the coffee.After roasting, the coffee is ground into a fine powder. The ninth stage is blending, where different types of coffee are mixed together to create a unique flavor profile. The tenth stage is packaging, where the coffee is packed into jars or bags. Finally, the coffee is labeled and prepared for sale in supermarkets and shops, which is the eleventh and final stage of the process.Overall, it is clear that coffee undergoes a lengthy and complex process from the initial picking of the beans to the final preparation for sale. Each stage of the process is crucial in bringing out the unique flavors and aromas of the coffee, and ensuring that the final product is of high quality.
618;The diagram below shows how ethanol fuel is produced from corn.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram illustrates that the process of corn which is formed into ethanol fuel with various kinds of steps from the starting point of Corn to the lasting point of Transporting.Overall, there are 3 main steps of processing from the beginning to the end. In the fourth section and sixth section, adding water and liquid is the most important part of these formed of fuel.On the first step, the corn will be stored and milling to be reached to cooking. It will need 4 hours times to be cooked and water would be added into the cooking. On the second, Fermenting will be hold on (48 hours) after the cooking levels of speed. Then, the separating time has arrived, within this process the liquid is then added into the solids of separating product.In the final steps, after (5 hours) time of mixing purifying ethanol will be get its point. Taking ethanol has stored after its purifying steps and then transporting in the surface area to get to ethanol fuel.;The diagram illustrates the multi-step process of converting corn into ethanol fuel, a significant alternative energy source. The journey begins with corn, the primary raw material, which undergoes several transformations to become a viable fuel option. Initially, the corn is harvested and collected from farms, marking the beginning of the ethanol production process. The next step involves milling the corn into a fine powder to increase its surface area, facilitating the subsequent chemical reactions. This milled corn then undergoes a process known as saccharification, where enzymes break down the cornstarch into simple sugars. These sugars are then fermented with the help of yeast, converting them into ethanol and carbon dioxide.Following fermentation, the ethanol is separated from the by-products through a distillation process, which involves heating the mixture to separate the components based on their boiling points. The resulting ethanol is then dehydrated to remove any remaining water content, producing anhydrous ethanol that is suitable for use as fuel.The final step in this process is denaturation, where a small amount of a denaturing agent is added to the ethanol to make it unfit for human consumption, thereby differentiating it from potable alcohol and making it exclusively for fuel purposes. Finally, the ethanol is transported to fuel stations and blended with gasoline to create a fuel that is both environmentally friendly and a more sustainable option compared to traditional fossil fuels.In conclusion, the conversion of corn into ethanol fuel is a complex process that involves several crucial steps, from the harvesting of corn to the final transportation of ethanol. This process highlights the potential of biomass as a significant contributor to the global energy mix, offering a cleaner and more renewable alternative to traditional fossil fuels.
298;The diagram below shows how oil is expected in use of production of perfumeSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The given process chart illustrates how perfume is obtained using oil as an ingredient. Overall, the product undergoes 4 main steps, which involve prevalently water and the usage of heating and cooling down methods, in addition to a separation machine, before being ready to be used to create a fragrance.For starters, the water is placed in a metal tank and brought to the boiling point through direct flames. Then, the steam is conducted by a pipe to another cistern, where aromatic plants are added, in order to obtain oil vapor mixed with steam.Right afterward, the mixture goes into a pipe system, where a condensation process takes place, thanks to a condenser that uses cold water. In doing so, the cold water flowing in the condenser absorbs the heat that comes from the pipe where the oil and water solution is. After that, water mixed with essential oil reaches the last tank, in which a separator proceeds to take essential oil apart.

1038;The diagram below shows the life cycle of a salmon, from egg to adult fish.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram depicts the life-cycle of the salmon, from being an egg to transforming into a fully grown adult fish.The first stage of the salmon starts in the river, where the spawning of two mature salmons lead to the laying of eggs. The rivers have long been chosen by salmons for breeding spots because their fresh-saltless water is suitable for the eggs and the freshly hatched baby salmons to start maturing in. After emerging from the eggs, the hatchlings stay on in the fresh water till they pre-mature/partially grow. After gaining considerable size and adapting to the primary waters, they travel to the estuaries, the only stop-over between them and the oceans. Only the first of the young salmons to reach the estuaries are able to make it to the oceans. This is because once these small and stagnant water bodies get over-crowded, there is virtually no space left in them which in-turn leads to the death of many young salmons.The young salmons who were able to survive the estuaries journey to the oceans, where the salty water increases their size and makes them fully grown. After getting the maturity to breed, they go back to the rivers from where the cycle starts all-over again.In total, there are 8 stages in the life of a salmon to maturity, it starts in the rivers and ends in the rivers too.;The life-cycle of a salmon is a fascinating and complex process, as illustrated in the provided diagram. It begins in the river, where two mature salmons engage in spawning, resulting in the laying of eggs. This initial stage is crucial, as it sets the foundation for the development of the salmon. After the eggs are laid, they hatch into tiny hatchlings, which remain in the freshwater environment until they reach a stage of partial growth.During this period, the hatchlings, also known as alevins, rely on the yolk sac for nutrition and shelter. As they grow, they begin to develop into fry, at which point they start to feed on small insects and zooplankton. Once they have partially grown, they embark on an incredible journey to the estuaries, a critical stop-over point between the river and the ocean. The estuaries serve as a transitional zone, where the young salmons, now called smolts, acclimate to the salty water and prepare themselves for the next stage of their life-cycle.The estuaries provide a unique environment, where freshwater and saltwater mix, allowing the smolts to adapt to the changing conditions. This adaptation is essential, as it enables them to survive in the ocean, where they will spend most of their adult life. The journey from the river to the estuaries is a critical phase in the life-cycle of a salmon, as it marks the transition from a freshwater to a saltwater environment. From here, the salmons will continue to grow and mature, eventually returning to the river to spawn and start the cycle anew. The diagram effectively illustrates this remarkable journey, highlighting the various stages and environments that a salmon encounters from egg to adulthood.
458;The diagram below shows the life cycle of the honey bee.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;Overall the cycle of life of the honey bee can be divided in 6 steps which can be grouped in 2 main stages: hatching and reaching for maturity. This process lasts around 34 to 36 days and it repeats itself over again.The cycle starts when female bees lay their eggs. They lay their eggs rapidly but surely at around 1 or 2 eggs every 3 days. Subsequently the hatching of the eggs happens after 9 to 10 days.Afterwards the nymph molts begin to come out of the eggs and keep on gradually growing up until the 7th day of the cycle. During their 9th day, the bees grow 3 times their initial size. Following this, the young adult emerges. The final step occurs after 4 days when the bee reaches its maturity and females are ready to lay eggs again. Making the cycle begin again from the laying of the eggs.;"The life cycle of the honey bee is a complex and fascinating process that can be divided into six distinct steps. These steps can be broadly categorized into two main stages: hatching and reaching maturity. This intricate cycle is essential for the survival and propagation of the honey bee species.The first stage, which can be termed as ""hatching,"" encompasses the initial steps of the honey bee's life cycle. This stage begins with the emergence of a bee from its egg, which typically takes place after a brief incubation period. The newly hatched bee, also known as a larva, is fed royal jelly and bee bread, which provides it with the necessary nutrients for growth.As the larva grows, the second stage of its life cycle commences, which involves reaching maturity. During this stage, the larva undergoes a series of physical transformations, including the development of its body parts and the formation of its adult features. This metamorphosis is a critical phase, as it prepares the bee for its future roles within the hive.The entire life cycle of a honey bee, from hatching to reaching maturity, lasts approximately 34 to 36 days. This duration can vary slightly depending on factors such as the availability of food and the overall health of the hive. Once a bee reaches maturity, it begins its adult life, taking on various responsibilities within the hive, such as foraging, caring for young, and defending the colony.Notably, the life cycle of the honey bee is a continuous process, with new bees hatching and maturing every day. This ensures the ongoing survival and prosperity of the colony, as older bees eventually die off and are replaced by younger, healthier individuals. The cycle repeats itself over again, maintaining the delicate balance and social structure of the hive. In conclusion, the life cycle of the honey bee is a remarkable and highly organized process, with its two main stages of hatching and reaching maturity working in tandem to sustain the species."

The fibrous top surface also offers a degree of flexibility, allowing the storage area to absorb minor stresses without sustaining damage.In conclusion, the construction of a storage area using concrete canvas material, as illustrated in the diagram, is a systematic process that involves combining three critical layers: a waterproof layer, a dry concrete layer, and a fibrous top surface. Each layer plays a vital role in ensuring the storage area is strong, durable, and protected from environmental factors, making concrete canvas an attractive option for various storage needs.
126;The diagram shows the components of a neuron and how it worksWrite a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram below identifies the role of each neuronal components and illustrates the message transmission process happening in a neuron.The main component of a neuron is the cell body or soma. From its core branches out many small nerves called dendrites with the role of receving messages from other cells. The acquired messages are passed away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles or glands through a chain of axon. Each axon is coverred by a small element called myelin sheath that helps speed up the neural impulses.The message transmission process is conducted by continous actions of each component. After the dendrites receive information, the cell body will trigger an electrical signal traveling down the axon chain carrying these messages to a destination consisting of a network off terminal buttons. Each button form junction with other dendrite other cells to connect the messages. After all, all neuron are connected to form a network.;The human nervous system is a complex and intricate network of specialized cells, known as neurons, which play a crucial role in controlling and coordinating the body's functions. At the heart of each neuron is the cell body, also referred to as the soma, which serves as the main component of the cell. The cell body is responsible for containing the nucleus and the majority of the cell's organelles, making it the center of the neuron's metabolic activity.Extending from the cell body are numerous small, branching nerves called dendrites. These dendrites are highly specialized and play a vital role in the neuron's function, as they are responsible for receiving messages from other cells. The dendrites act as the neuron's antennae, collecting and processing signals from adjacent neurons, which are then transmitted to the cell body. This process enables the neuron to integrate and interpret information from multiple sources, allowing it to make informed decisions regarding the transmission of signals.The unique structure of the neuron, with its cell body and dendrites, enables it to effectively receive, process, and transmit information. The dendrites, with their extensive surface area, are able to collect a vast array of signals, which are then funneled to the cell body for processing. This specialized design allows neurons to communicate with one another, facilitating the complex interactions that underlie our thoughts, movements, and sensations. In conclusion, the cell body and dendrites are essential components of a neuron, working in tandem to enable the reception, integration, and transmission of information, highlighting the remarkable complexity and sophistication of the human nervous system.
486;The diagram shows the design of a modern landfill for household waste. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;These illustration graphs explain the process of how a modern landfill for domestic waste is created.There are three sective of entire process, including construction, which could be divided into two steps, followed by the section of the use and the final part which is the closure.Start with the construction by createing an artificial deep hole, which surrounded by the natural rocks. Pilling up the hole with synthetic substance and clay ,respectively, before instal the drainage tank and grainage pipes. Four drainage pipes are settled parallelly and all connected with a main pipe reach out the hole.After the preparation is completed, it comse with the official use. Set the domestic trash inside the hole, which allows the waste liguid draning in the ground through the clay. The last part is closure, which the holw will be coved with clay, which the gases produced along the process will be outputted through the pipes connect to outer place.;The creation of a modern landfill for domestic waste involves a meticulous process, divided into three successive sections: construction, use, and closure. The construction phase is the initial stage, where the site is prepared to receive waste. This begins with the selection of a suitable location, typically in areas with low environmental sensitivity and minimal ecological impact. Once the site is chosen, engineers design the landfill, ensuring it meets stringent environmental and safety standards. This includes the installation of a liner system at the bottom and sides of the landfill to prevent leakage of toxic substances into groundwater. Additionally, a network of pipes is laid to collect gas produced by decomposing waste, which can be used as a source of renewable energy.The use phase follows, where the landfill begins to receive domestic waste. This phase involves the daily management of waste disposal, including the spreading and compacting of waste to maximize storage capacity. Leachate collection systems are also continuously monitored and maintained to treat any liquid waste that seeps through the waste mass. Moreover, gas collection systems are operated to harvest methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and utilize it for energy production, thereby reducing the landfill's environmental footprint.The final stage is closure, which occurs when the landfill reaches its capacity. At this point, a capping process is initiated, where a layer of soil or synthetic material is placed over the waste to prevent further decomposition and erosion. The site is then landscaped and can be reused for purposes such as parks or wildlife habitats, provided it meets safety and environmental criteria. The closure phase also includes long-term monitoring to ensure that the capped landfill does not pollute the surrounding environment. Throughout these three phases, the goal of a modern landfill is not only to dispose of domestic waste efficiently but also to minimize environmental impact, emphasizing sustainability and ecological preservation.
240;The diagram shows the different stages in the production of woolen goods.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram below depicts several steps in producing the woolen goods.Overall, we can divide the steps into two stages where the first one is you have to produce the wool and the second one is to make the string.In order to get the wool pr the string, we have to do the shearing process and clean them after we take them from the sheep. After that, we let them dry in a sufficient temperature outside so that we can spin them.After we finish the spinning process, we break them into two productions which are wool and string. The string production can be recycled while the wool can be made into tufts of wool and put them in the tuft of storage.The balls of yarn comes from the tuft storage which later are the things that we are knitting. The balls of yarn are also the main source to make woolen goods such carpets and jackets which are usually we use in a daily life.;The production of woolen goods is a complex process that involves several stages. As illustrated in the diagram, the process can be broadly divided into two main stages: producing the wool and making the string.The first stage, which is producing the wool, is a crucial step in the production of woolen goods. This stage involves the process of shearing sheep to obtain raw wool. The raw wool is then sorted and cleaned to remove any impurities or debris. After cleaning, the wool is carded, which involves brushing the wool fibers to align them in the same direction. This process produces a rope-like strand called a sliver. The sliver is then spun into yarn, which is the foundation for all woolen goods.The second stage, which is making the string, involves transforming the yarn into the final product. This stage includes weaving or knitting the yarn into the desired shape and form. Weaving involves interlacing two or more yarns at right angles to create a fabric, while knitting involves using needles to create rows of interconnected loops. The resulting fabric can then be cut and sewn into the final woolen goods, such as clothing, blankets, or carpets.In conclusion, the production of woolen goods is a multi-step process that can be divided into two main stages: producing the wool and making the string. Each stage is critical to the production of high-quality woolen goods, and attention to detail is required at every step to ensure that the final product meets the required standards. By following these stages, manufacturers can produce a wide range of woolen goods that are warm, durable, and comfortable to wear.

794;The diagram shows the production of hydroelectricitySummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram displays the general principles of how electricity is generated in a dam. In general, to produce hydroenergy, there should be a difference in the level of water flowing through the turbine.The water is stored in the reservoir out of which it goes through the intake to the penstrock. The pens should be inclined. This means that its high point is in the intake and then it goes down to the turbine. The pressure, that the flow creates, makes the turbin roll and start the generator. Generator produces power that is supplied to the long distance power lines.Having passed throuth the turbine, water, in its turn, sharply goes down and falls into the river.As it can be seen from the diagram, the generator and long distance power lines are located on the ground while there parts of the dam, such as the intake, the penstock, and the turbine are all under the ground.;The diagram illustrates the fundamental principles of hydroelectricity generation in a dam, providing a comprehensive overview of the process. At its core, the production of hydroenergy relies on a simple yet ingenious mechanism: the difference in water level as it flows through the turbine. This disparity in elevation is crucial, as it enables the water to flow from a higher point to a lower point, thus creating the kinetic energy required to turn the turbine.As the water flows through the turbine, its kinetic energy is converted into mechanical energy, causing the turbine to rotate. This rotation is then transferred to the generator, which is the heart of the hydroelectric power plant. The generator's primary function is to convert the mechanical energy of the rotating turbine into electrical energy. This is achieved through electromagnetic induction, where the rotation of the turbine causes a magnetic field to rotate within the generator, inducing an electrical current.The generator produces power that is then supplied to the long-distance power lines, which transmit the electricity over vast distances to reach consumers. This process is highly efficient, as it harnesses the renewable energy of moving water to generate electricity, making it a cleaner and more sustainable option compared to fossil fuels. In conclusion, the diagram effectively demonstrates the general principles of hydroelectricity generation in a dam, highlighting the importance of water level difference, the role of the turbine and generator, and the transmission of power through long-distance power lines. This technology plays a vital role in meeting our energy needs while minimizing our environmental footprint.

192;The diagrams below show how houses can be protected in areas which are prone to flooding.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The schemes compare two different methods of defence for homes that can be easily affected by floods. Overall, they show flood protection with and without a stopbank, while the at-risk home is raised higher above ground level in two pictures.The first diagram depicts how a stopbank acts as a natural barrier to prevent river water from flooding. The stopbank is a small mound of land next to the river that is higher than the 100-year-flood level and prevents the drain from overwhelming its banks. Nearby buildings can be built on stilts to prevent flooding from rainwater as well as the water passing through the floodgate beneath the stopbank, resulting in an area of ‘internal ponding.’If it had not been a stopbank, as described in the second diagram, there would have been nothing to stop the river from flooding. In this case, the solution is to put homes on stilts much higher than the one in the first picture. The height of the stilts is measured to ensure that the floor of the house is three hundred meters above the 100-year-flood level regardless of how deep the water area is under the house. This measure is called the ‘freeboard.’;The threat of flooding poses a significant risk to homes located in low-lying areas or near bodies of water. In order to mitigate this risk, homeowners can employ various methods of defence to protect their properties. Two such methods are compared in the provided schemes, which illustrate flood protection with and without a stopbank.The first method involves the construction of a stopbank, a type of levee or embankment designed to prevent floodwaters from reaching the home. In this scenario, the at-risk home is situated behind the stopbank, which acts as a barrier to prevent water from inundating the property. The stopbank is typically built to a height that exceeds the expected flood level, providing a safe and dry zone for the home.In contrast, the second method does not utilize a stopbank. Instead, the at-risk home is raised higher above ground level, using stilts or pilings to elevate the structure. This approach allows floodwaters to flow underneath the home, reducing the risk of damage from floodwaters. The elevated home is designed to withstand flood conditions, with the foundation and structural elements reinforced to resist flood forces.The schemes demonstrate the effectiveness of both methods in protecting homes from flood damage. By comparing the two approaches, homeowners can make informed decisions about the best method of defence for their specific situation. The use of a stopbank can provide a high level of protection, but may be more expensive and require significant land area. On the other hand, raising the home above ground level can be a more cost-effective solution, while also allowing for the natural flow of floodwaters. Ultimately, the choice of defence method will depend on factors such as flood risk, budget, and environmental considerations.

This makes them an attractive option for coastal areas where space is limited or where the wave energy is not extremely high. The low installation costs and relatively low maintenance requirements of these machines make them a viable solution for generating renewable energy from ocean waves.The use of two turbines in the machine allows for an efficient flow of air, which is essential for generating electricity from the wave energy. As the waves move up and down, they drive the turbines, which in turn, drive the generator to produce electricity. This mechanism underscores the potential of wave energy as a renewable and sustainable source of power. By leveraging the power of ocean waves, the picture show wave-energy machine presents a promising approach to reducing our reliance on fossil fuels and mitigating the impacts of climate change.In conclusion, the picture show wave-energy machine is a testament to human ingenuity in developing innovative solutions for renewable energy production. Its design, which incorporates an electricity generator and dual turbines, highlights the potential for harnessing wave energy efficiently. With its low installation costs and ability to generate electricity from even small waves, this technology holds significant promise for the future of sustainable energy production.
916;The diagrams below show the development of the horse over a period of 40 million years.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant;The diagram depicts the different stages of the body habitus and the relative changes in foot structures that under went in the process of evolution of the modern horse, since 40 million years ago.The modern horse had gone through 3 main stages in order to become it's current version, each stage shows distinctive changes in the body as a whole.Having said that, the earliest species that existed is namely Echippus, then it was mesohippus and finally it was Merychippus.The Echippus is the identified first ancestor of the modern horse that existed 40 million years ago. They appeared relatively similar to the size of a sheep and their foot apearently had four toes.However, Mesohippus was the second in line of the modern horses and was relatively bigger and taller, the foot structure got limited to three toes and the middle toe being the widerest.15 million years after the existance of mesohippus, merychippus emerged, they were similar in both the size and shape of our modern horses, but as far as the foot is concerned the middle toe became more prominent and the rest two toes started to shrink. Finally, the modern horses look twice the size of Echippus and their feet looked proper coronet.;The modern horse, a majestic and powerful creature, has undergone a significant transformation over millions of years. The evolution of the horse is a fascinating process that has involved several stages, to ultimately become the animal we know today. The development of the modern horse can be broadly categorized into three main stages, each marked by distinct physical and behavioral changes.The earliest known ancestor of the modern horse is Eohippus, a small, multi-toed forest dweller that lived around 50 million years ago. Eohippus was a far cry from the sleek, single-hoofed horses we see today, with its primitive body and multiple toes on each foot. As the environment and ecosystems changed, Eohippus evolved into Mesohippus, a slightly larger and more advanced species. Mesohippus lived around  to 30 million years ago and had a more modern horse-like body, although it still had multiple toes.The final stage in the evolution of the modern horse is marked by the emergence of Merychippus, a species that lived around 25-30 million years ago. Merychippus was a single-hoofed horse, with a more refined body and a diet that consisted mainly of grasses. From Merychippus, the modern horse, Equus caballus, eventually emerged, with its characteristic single hoof, powerful legs, and sleek body. The evolution of the horse is a testament to the incredible adaptability and resilience of life on Earth, and a reminder of the complex and ever-changing nature of the natural world. Through these three main stages, the modern horse has developed into the magnificent creature we know and admire today.

The kitchen furniture suggested to be located on the opposite side to the wall and doubled indoor door. However, some things stays the same in both plans. For example, the location of both entrance doors - front and backyard and also wall between hall and kitchen.;The existing floor plan of the residence is currently under review, with suggestions for modifications being proposed. Upon examination of the recommended changes, it becomes apparent that the overall layout and functionality of the space will remain largely intact. The core purpose of each room will be preserved, with the kitchen continuing to serve as the central hub for food preparation and the living room retaining its role as a communal area for relaxation and socialization.The fact that there are no drastic alterations envisioned for the kitchen and living room underscores the effectiveness of the current design. These areas, which are often considered the heart of any home, will maintain their original functions, ensuring a sense of continuity and familiarity. The kitchen, equipped with its existing amenities and layout, will persist in its role as the culinary center of the house, while the living room will continue to provide a comfortable and inviting space for entertainment, leisure, and interaction among family and friends.The minor adjustments proposed do not fundamentally alter the essence or utility of these critical living spaces. This approach suggests a thoughtful and conservative strategy towards renovation, implying that the current configuration is satisfactory and that only subtle refinements are needed to enhance the overall livability and aesthetic appeal of the residence. By retaining the basic structure and purpose of the kitchen and living room, the suggested changes aim to build upon and slightly improve the existing layout rather than revolutionize it. This considered approach to renovation is not only cost-effective but also minimizes disruption to the daily routines and comforts of the occupants.

136;The diagrams show the structure of solar panel and its use.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram illustrates how a solar panel is constructed, and the complex process of how the renewable energy source provides heated water and air to households.The first diagram shows us visual information about the basic structure of the solar panel. It´s construction is mainly a large box with two pipes placed on both sides. Then, one equally large top which is transparent is placed on top of the container.According to the second diagram, the solar panel is designed to provide the home with warm air. Firstly, cold air is allowed in through the inlet and let inside the box. Secondly, the transparent top allows sunrays to transform the cool air to warm air by their heating properties. After that, the warm air goes through and out the outlet.In regards to the third diagram, we can clearly see that the construction is similar with the exception that water pipes are added in the main box, in order to supply households with hot water. In comparison with the second diagram, where air was driven through the pipes, water is the main resource here. After the water has entered the inlet, water passes through the pipes and out;The diagram illustrating the construction of a solar panel reveals a fascinating process of harnessing renewable energy to provide heated water and air to households. At its core, the solar panel's structure is relatively straightforward, consisting of a large box with two pipes positioned on either side. This simple yet effective design is crucial for the panel's functionality.Sitting atop the container is an equally large, transparent top that plays a pivotal role in the energy conversion process. This transparent layer allows sunlight to penetrate and interact with the internal components of the panel. The sun's rays, rich in thermal energy, are then utilized to heat the air within the panel through their inherent heating properties. This natural process transforms cool air into warm air, laying the foundation for the solar panel's ability to provide warmth.The process by which solar panels generate heated water and air for household use is complex and highly efficient. Essentially, the solar panel acts as a collector, converting sunlight into thermal energy. This energy is then transferred to water or air through the pipes, which are integrated into the panel's design. The heated water or air can subsequently be circulated throughout a household, providing a sustainable source of warmth without the need for fossil fuels.The use of solar panels for heating represents a significant step towards reducing our reliance on non-renewable energy sources.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Today’s society overwhelmingly depends on products made from fossil fuels. Most people would initially think about fuel for transport, but of course, fossil fuels are part of most of the fabric of life around us, from the plastics on our furniture to the pavements that we walk on. Changing our reliance on these resources can have various consequences; however, I believe that overall the society will benefit from finding viable alternatives for them.Depending on whether eco-friendly alternatives are developed, the positive effect on transport and the reduction of the associated pollution will be significant. Exhaust fumes from motor vehicles, planes and ships decrease air quality and contribute to global warming and the greenhouse effect. People’s health and the health of the planet will surely improve without these industries relying on fossil fuels. It could be that a type of transport crisis could develop as a result if society can no longer provide the power to transport so many individuals to where they want to go. This, however, does not have to be a bad thing, as it could force society to use alternative solutions, such as transport sharing and public transport development. The change in mind set has already begun. Some countries have already committed to having fossil fuel free transport and more cities are banning private vehicles from the centre of cities.Another positive development would be that more time and money would have to be put into developing renewable sources of energy, such as wind power, solar power, hydropower and tidal power. Technologies would improve and be more efficient and again, the world would use fewer sources of energy that cause pollution. This development can also be seen today, with many governments committing to proportions of their power needs coming from renewable resources.I, therefore, strongly agree with the statement that the changes from reducing reliance on fossil fuels will be positive. The only caveat is that society will need to have developed alternative sources of power rather soon, in order to avoid an energy crisis.";The reliance on fossil fuels in today's society is a pressing concern. The majority of products we use daily, from plastics to synthetic fibers, are made from fossil fuels. Moreover, the transportation sector is heavily dependent on fossil fuels, with most vehicles running on gasoline or diesel. However, the shift towards alternative energy sources is expected to have a significant positive impact on transport. Electric vehicles, for instance, are becoming increasingly popular, and their adoption is expected to reduce the associated pollution from fossil fuels.The reduction in pollution will have a substantial effect on the environment and public health. With fewer emissions from vehicles, the air quality in urban areas will improve, leading to a decrease in respiratory diseases and other health problems. Furthermore, the decreased reliance on fossil fuels will also help mitigate climate change, which is one of the most significant challenges facing our planet today.On the other hand, a type of transport crisis could develop if society can no longer provide the power to transport so many individuals. As the global population continues to grow, the demand for transportation is increasing, and if alternative energy sources are not developed and implemented quickly, we may face a crisis in the transportation sector. This could lead to increased costs, decreased mobility, and a significant impact on the economy. Therefore, it is essential that we continue to invest in alternative energy sources and develop sustainable transportation systems to ensure that we can meet the demands of a growing population while also protecting the environment. By doing so, we can mitigate the risks associated with our reliance on fossil fuels and create a more sustainable future for generations to come.
1307;The fact that enormous sums are paid for pieces of art is not acceptable at a time when many people around the world live in poverty. Discuss this statement and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is true that pieces of art in today’s world can change hands for enormous sums. Works by artists such as Picasso, da Vinci and Rembrandt have been sold for millions of dollars. Recently, a Modigliani was sold to a billionaire for one hundred and seventy million dollars. It certainly seems obscene that such figures are spent when many people around the world live in poverty.The work of many charities would be transformed by the money generated by just one of these art sales and in turn, the lives of ordinary people in need would be transformed. Medicines, food and shelter amongst other things could easily be provided, saving lots of lives, many of which would be children. When the issue is looked at from this point of view, the art sales world certainly seems obscene.However, in my opinion, things are unlikely to change. Human greed is endemic and people who have the drive to earn that amount of money and who actually have access to these sums in cash are not often people who will part with their wealth. Lots of prosperous people support many charities, but it is unlikely that they would completely relinquish their access to the luxuries that accompany their lives. The works of art are also often seen as investments in themselves, to be held on to for a period of time and then resold at a profit.In conclusion, in an ideal world, the vast sums of money that are spent on fine and rare works of art would be better spent on helping those in need. In reality, however, this is unlikely to take place.;The art world was recently abuzz with the news of a Modigliani painting being sold to a billionaire for a staggering $170 million. This sale is a testament to the enduring value and allure of fine art, particularly rare and exceptional pieces like those created by Modigliani. However, it also prompts a poignant reflection on the distribution of wealth and resources in our society. In an ideal world, one could argue that the vast sums of money spent on such artworks would be better allocated towards helping those in need.The purchase of a painting for $170 million raises important questions about priorities. While art has the power to inspire, educate, and bring joy to people's lives, the reality is that many individuals and communities around the globe are struggling with basic necessities like food, water, and shelter. The amount spent on a single painting could potentially fund numerous initiatives aimed at alleviating poverty, supporting healthcare, and promoting education.It's not to say that art does not have value or that it should not be cherished and supported. However, when considering the scale of human need and suffering, it becomes clear that our collective priorities might be skewed. In an ideal world, there would be a more balanced approach, where both the preservation and celebration of art, and the welfare of humanity, are given due consideration.Ultimately, the sale of the Modigliani to a billionaire for $170 million serves as a stark reminder of the economic disparities that exist in our world. It challenges us to think critically about how we choose to allocate our resources and to consider the potential positive impact that could be achieved if such vast sums were directed towards addressing global challenges and improving lives.
1042;The first chart below gives information about the money spent by British parents on their children’s sports between 2008 and 2014. The second chart shows the number of children who participated in three sports in Britain over the same time period.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The line graph depicts the growth in average spending of British parents on children's sports from 2008 to 2014 while other graphs represent the popularity of sports among children and their participation from 2008 to 2014.Overall, the first graph was about the average monthly spend on children's sports which was at an exponential rate while in the second graph football was the most popular among children.To begin with the first graph, the average monthly spending of parents on children's sports was increasing at an enormous rate from 20 pounds in 2004 to approximately 33 pounds in 2014.Meanwhile, the second graph was about participation in three different sports where football was the most popular sport among children approximately 7.9 million in 2008 to roughly 8 million. swimming was growing at a certain rate while athletics was not so popular until 2010 after that there was a rush in participation in contrast to swimming but after the peak in 2012, there was a decrease in participation.;The growth in average spending of British parents on children's sports is a notable trend that has been observed over the past few years. According to the line graph, there has been a steady increase in spending from 2008 to 2014. This upward trend suggests that parents are placing a greater emphasis on their children's involvement in sports, and are willing to invest more money to support their participation.One possible explanation for this increase in spending is the growing popularity of sports among children. As evidenced by the second graph, football is the most popular sport among children, with approximately 7.9 million participants in 2008 and roughly 8 million in subsequent years. This high level of participation is likely driven by the fact that football is a widely accessible and affordable sport, making it an attractive option for parents looking to get their children involved in physical activity.The fact that spending on children's sports has increased despite the economic downturn during this period suggests that parents are prioritizing their children's sports participation. This is likely due to the numerous benefits associated with sports participation, including improved physical health, social skills, and emotional well-being. As a result, parents are willing to invest in their children's sports activities, whether it be through equipment, lessons, or league fees.Overall, the data suggests that British parents are recognizing the value of sports participation for their children and are willing to invest in their development. The popularity of sports, particularly football, is likely to continue to drive spending on children's sports in the future. As such, it is likely that the trend of increasing spending on children's sports will persist, as parents continue to prioritize their children's involvement in physical activity.
52;The first chart below shows the percentages of women and men in a country involved in some kinds of home tasks (cooking, cleaning, pet caring and repairing the house. The second chart shows the amount of time each gender spent on each task per day.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The two given charts illustrates the houshold work done by male and female of a nation. where firstly, the amount of work done by men and women is measured in percentage, and secondly, the average time devoted to do perform those work is calculated in minutes.Overall, it can be clearly seen that women performed more tasks in both the given terms then men, Although, men performed House repairs more than women.Firstly, women performed more household work than men, their main interest was in cooking and cleaning, where 80% of women performed Cooking and 60 percent cleaning, where men were 20% less in both the tasks. However, Tasks like pet care and house repairs male were higher in percentage then female.Secondly, Ladies performed the mentioned tasks more than men in regards of cooking they spent about 1 hour and 20 min and in cleaning approximately 68 minutes. However, they were equal in pet care, Although men spend close to 20 min minutes in house repair on average basis.;The two given charts provide a comprehensive insight into the distribution of household work among males and females in a nation. Upon analyzing the data, it is evident that women assume a greater burden of household responsibilities compared to their male counterparts. In both charts, women are seen to be performing a multitude of tasks, as opposed to men, who seem to have a more limited range of responsibilities. This disparity is particularly notable, with women shouldering the bulk of domestic work such as cleaning, cooking, and childcare. The data suggests that women are shouldering a disproportionate amount of household work, highlighting the existing gender disparities in domestic responsibilities.However, there is an exception to this trend. Men are found to be performing more house repairs than women. This is an interesting deviation from the overall pattern, as it indicates that men are taking on more responsibility in tasks that require manual labor and technical expertise. This could be attributed to societal expectations and gender roles, where men are often expected to handle tasks that are perceived as requiring more physical strength and technical know-how.Overall, the charts paint a picture of a society where women are still shouldering the bulk of household work, while men are taking on specific tasks that are often seen as traditionally masculine. This highlights the need for a more equitable distribution of household responsibilities, where both men and women share the workload more evenly. By recognizing and addressing these disparities, we can work towards creating a more balanced and fair society, where both genders have an equal share of household work and responsibilities.
1188;The first chart below shows the results of a survey which sampled a cross-section of 100,000 people asking if they traveled abroad and why they traveled for the period 1994-98.The second chart shows their destinations over the same period.;The first chart indicates the results of a survey of people in the UK who traveled abroad and the reasons why they traveled from 1994 and 1998. In addition, there is another chart which areas they visited. Overall, it can be seen the main reason the UK residents visited abroad is for holiday, and the total number of people who traveled steadily increased every year, except for 1995. In addition, they visited Western Europe extraordinarily much higher than north America, and other areas.Initially, the total number of abroad visiter started at 22,072 in 1994. Somehow the total number decreased in 1995. It was specificalltry 21,610, but the number soared to 24,949 and reached a peak of 28,828 in 1996 and 1998 respectively. To break down the detail, the main purpose is for holidays. It is apparently much higher than other reasons and its percentage tend to be almost two-thirds every year. Aside from holidays, two reasons follow the second reason for business, the third reason for visits to friends and relatives. It is not so significant changes in percentage.Interestingly, , they almost visited western Europe from 1994 to 1998. The proportion of visitors is much higher than in north America and other areas.It seems to be around 90 percent of visitors went to western Europe.The proportion of visiter can be seen slightly increased, however, there is no significant change.;The United Kingdom has consistently demonstrated a strong affinity for international travel, with a significant portion of its residents embarking on journeys abroad each year. Among the various motivations for traveling, the pursuit of leisure and recreation stands out as the primary driver, with the majority of UK residents traveling abroad for holiday purposes.Over the years, the total number of people traveling from the UK has exhibited a steady increase, with a notable exception in 1995, which saw a deviation from this upward trend. This consistent growth in travel numbers underscores the enduring appeal of exploring foreign destinations among UK residents. The allure of experiencing different cultures, landscapes, and entertainment options abroad continues to captivate a growing number of travelers from the UK.Geographically, the travel patterns of UK residents reveal a pronounced preference for Western Europe. This region has emerged as the most popular destination, attracting an extraordinarily high number of visitors compared to other areas. The proximity, cultural affinity, and ease of travel within Western Europe make it an ideal and accessible holiday spot for those from the UK. In contrast, destinations in North America, while still popular, receive significantly fewer visitors from the UK than Western Europe. Other regions, such as Africa, Asia, and South America, also attract fewer UK travelers, although they still offer unique and appealing experiences that draw a dedicated subset of travelers.The dominance of Western Europe in UK travel patterns can be attributed to factors such as shorter travel distances, familiar languages, and a shared cultural heritage, which collectively enhance the appeal of these destinations. Furthermore, the diversity within Western Europe, ranging from the romantic cities of France and Italy to the vibrant nightlife of Spain and the historical sites of Germany, ensures that there is something for every type of traveler, thereby solidifying its position as the preferred holiday destination for UK residents.

714;The flow chart illustrates the consequence of deforestation. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features.You should write at least 150 words.;"The supplied illustration outlines the problems of cutting forests. As we can see, there are 4 main branches and each of them describes a certain issue, caused by deforestation.According to the first branch from the left, forest destruction can lead to the state when soil becomes hard and ""baked"". It occurs due to the fact that heavy logging equipment compresses the soil, as the first block of the chart says. Because soil becomes ""baked"", rain water starts to run off which causes flooding.If we look at the remaining branches, we can see that they all lead to the same conclusion - less biodiversity. But there are three different reasons for it. The first one is soil erosion. When we cut the trees, we have fewer tree roots to support the topsoil that eventually erodes.The second reason - increased risk of burning. It is followed by the destruction of waste wood. Then we have some micro-organisms such as pioneer species that move in and initiate degradation of vegetation. And it's all resulted in less biodiversity.The last branch starts with the fact that after cutting forests we have less plants to give back moisture to air, so less moisture enters the air. This triggers less precipitation, and so, increased droughts. Plants that unable to withstand hot and dry weather die and it ends with less biodiversity.To conclude everything, the main purpose of the presented flow chart was to demonstrate the severe damage that could be caused by deforestation.";The issue of deforestation has become a pressing concern in recent years, with far-reaching consequences for the environment. One of the primary flow charts used to illustrate the effects of deforestation highlights the severe damage that can be caused by cutting down forests. Upon examining the chart, it becomes clear that deforestation can lead to a multitude of negative outcomes, including soil erosion, increased risk of burning, and a significant reduction in biodiversity.Soil erosion occurs when trees are removed, leaving the soil vulnerable to erosion by wind and water. This can lead to the loss of fertile land, making it difficult to sustain plant life. Furthermore, the risk of burning increases with deforestation, as the removal of trees creates an environment prone to wildfires. These fires can have devastating effects on the surrounding ecosystem, causing irreparable damage to the natural habitat.Perhaps the most alarming consequence of deforestation, however, is the loss of biodiversity. As we follow the branches of the flow chart, it becomes apparent that every path leads to the same conclusion: a significant reduction in biodiversity. The removal of forests disrupts the delicate balance of ecosystems, causing the extinction of countless species that rely on these habitats for survival. This not only has a profound impact on the environment but also on human societies, which rely on biodiversity for food, medicine, and other essential resources.In conclusion, the flow chart effectively demonstrates the severe damage caused by deforestation, highlighting the importance of preserving our forests. It is imperative that we take immediate action to prevent further deforestation and protect the world's biodiversity. By doing so, we can mitigate the effects of soil erosion, reduce the risk of burning, and preserve the rich tapestry of life on Earth. Ultimately, the preservation of our forests is crucial for the health of our planet and the well-being of future generations.
78;The graph and chart below give information on the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures in degrees Celsius (°C) and the average number of days with rainfall each month for two Australian cities.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The line graph and chart below show data on the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures in degrees Celsius and the average number of days with rainfall each month, from January to December, for Brisbane and Canberra in Australia.Overall, both cities have similar tendencies throughout the entire period. Likewise, Canberra has lower temperatures than Brisbane during the whole year. In addition, Brisbane has a higher average number of days with rainfall than Canberra during most of the year.To start with, Canberra's maximum average daily temperatures have a significant decrease in tendency, from 27 degrees in January to only 11 degrees in July. In contrast, Brisbane's daily maximum temperatures present lower fluctuations from 28 degrees in January to just 21 degrees in July. Additionally, Brisbane reaches its highest maximum average daily temperature in February at 30 degrees, whilst Canberra reaches its lowest minimum average daily temperature in June and July at 2 degrees. Furthermore, the average number of days with rainfall decreases moderately during the winter season in Brisbane, from 14 days in February to 7 days in June, July and August. However, this is the opposite tendency in the average number of days with rainfall in Canberra which slightly increases from 7 days in February to 10 days in June, July and August.To sum up, Canberra has rainy and cold winters, whilst Brisbane has rainy and warm summers.;The cities of Canberra and Brisbane exhibit distinct climate patterns, with notable differences in temperature and rainfall distribution throughout the year. One of the primary differences is in temperature, with Canberra generally experiencing lower temperatures than Brisbane for most of the year. This suggests that Canberra has a cooler climate overall, which is consistent with its location in the Australian Capital Territory, farther inland and at a higher elevation than Brisbane.In terms of rainfall, Brisbane surpasses Canberra with a higher average number of days with rainfall. This indicates that Brisbane's climate is more humid and prone to precipitation compared to Canberra. The rainfall pattern in Brisbane is particularly pronounced during the summer months, contributing to its characterization as having warm and rainy summers. This is further emphasized by Brisbane reaching its highest maximum average daily temperature in February, at 30 degrees Celsius, highlighting the city's warm summer climate.In contrast, Canberra's climate is marked by rainy and cold winters. This seasonal pattern is reflective of its more southerly and inland location, which exposes it to cold air masses from the south during the winter months. The combination of cold temperatures and rainfall during winters in Canberra stands in stark contrast to Brisbane's warm and rainy summers, underscoring the significant climatic differences between these two Australian cities.In summary, the climate comparison between Canberra and Brisbane reveals two distinct profiles: one of a cooler, rainy, and cold winter climate in Canberra, and another of a warmer, rainy, and humid summer climate in Brisbane. These differences are not only of interest for climatological studies but also have implications for the lifestyle, agriculture, and urban planning in each city. Understanding these climate patterns is essential for adapting to and mitigating the effects of weather extremes and for making the most of the unique conditions each city offers.
920;The graph and pie chart below give information on in-house training courses in a large financial company.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The charts illustrated are a representation of some information regarding in-house training courses in a reputable financial company.In the grand scheme of things, more time was spent on technical aspects of the courses than on the other aspects within the year. Quite conversely people spent less time learning about health and safety. Most of the managers and secretaries thought the courses were important for the job but a handful thought it was a waste of valuable time.55 hours in the year were devoted to training courses. Of these, exactly 30 hours were spent on technical skills, 15 on Career Development, 10 on Inter personal skills and 5 hours on Health and safety.The opinion of Managers and Secretaries was also sought as shown in the next chart. Here we see that majority of both managers and secretaries believe the courses are important for the job; about 84% of Secretaries and just around 76% of managers. It makes sense then that only few of these groups of people think the courses are a waste of time (almost 10% for secretaries and just above 10% for managers).Exactly 50% of managers believe the courses are good for net working while a smaller percentage of secretaries, about 43%, are of the same opinion. A good number still believe the courses provide a good excuse for a change - about 66% for Managers and just shy of 65% for Secretaries.";The reputable financial company in question has demonstrated a commitment to the development and well-being of its employees through its allocation of 55 hours in the year to training courses. This significant investment of time underscores the company's recognition of the importance of continuous learning and skill enhancement in a rapidly evolving financial landscape.A breakdown of the training hours reveals a balanced approach to employee development. Thirty hours were dedicated to technical skills, which is understandable given the complex and specialized nature of financial services. This training would equip employees with the latest knowledge and tools necessary to perform their jobs effectively and stay competitive in the market.In addition to technical skills, 15 hours were spent on Career Development, indicating the company's interest in the long-term growth and advancement of its staff. This not only benefits the employees by providing them with a clear pathway for professional progression but also the company, as it leads to increased job satisfaction and retention of skilled personnel.Interpersonal skills were also addressed, with  allocated 10 hours, acknowledging the critical role that communication, teamwork, and leadership play in a successful financial organization. In today's team-based work environments, such skills are essential for effective collaboration and client relationship management.Lastly,  emphasized the company's concern for the overall well-being of its employees, with 5 hours dedicated to Health and Safety. This aspect, although seemingly minor in terms of hours, sends a significant message about the company's prioritization of employee welfare and compliance with regulatory standards.While the majority of managers and secretaries viewed these courses as invaluable for job performance and career enhancement, a minority expressed skepticism, considering them a waste of valuable time. This divergence in opinion highlights the challenge that organizations face in catering to diverse perceptions of what constitutes beneficial training. Nonetheless, the company's proactive stance on employee development through these training courses is commendable and likely to yield positive outcomes in terms of employee satisfaction, productivity, and ultimately, the company's success.
922;The graph below compares figures for the production and consumption of energy in the US from 1950 to 2000. It also predicts figures for 2025.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The line chart gives the comparision figure about how energy produced and consumed by the U.S.A. in a 50 year period starting in 1950 along with a 25 year projection. There is two lines, one representing the American energy's consumption and the other about the energy production in the U.S.A between 1950 and 2000 and the forecast figure from 2001 to 2025. Those were measured by British thermal Units.By and large, the consumption and production of energy in the U.S.A. grew strongly over the period from 35 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to approximately 90 quadrillion Btu in 2000 and from 25 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to 65 quadrillion Btu in 2000 respectively. There are a prediction in energry consumption reaching 135 quadrillion Btu in 2025 and 75 quadrillion Btu in energy production.The first detail to note is that the consumption and production of engery rose steadily over the period. They were significant fluctuation at the start of the period but had risen to around 50 quadrillion Btu in 1975. This was followed by the another fluctuation between 1975 and 2000 and recovered by nearly 90 quadrillion Btu in energy consumption in 2000 and 65 quadrillion Btu in energy production.The amount of energy consumption in the United States is projected to remain much higher and will be increased as much as energy production overall. Amercian willl spend 75 quadrillion Btu in energy consumption more than in energy production in the prediction of 2025.;The United States has experienced significant growth in energy consumption and production over the past few decades. Between 1950 and 2000, the country's energy consumption and production skyrocketed from 35 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) to approximately 90 quadrillion Btu. This substantial increase is a testament to the nation's rapid industrialization, urbanization, and economic expansion during this period.The rising demand for energy in the U.S. can be attributed to various factors, including population growth, technological advancements, and increased economic activity. As the country's economy continued to grow, so did its energy needs, leading to a significant surge in energy consumption. The growth in energy production, on the other hand, was driven by advancements in extraction and generation technologies, allowing for more efficient and cost-effective production of energy.Looking ahead, energy consumption in the United States is projected to remain high, with continued growth expected in the coming years. In fact, energy production is also expected to increase, keeping pace with the rising demand for energy. This trend is likely to be driven by ongoing economic growth, population expansion, and the increasing use of energy-intensive technologies. As the U.S. continues to evolve and grow, its energy needs are likely to evolve as well, with a continued emphasis on meeting the country's growing energy demands through a combination of domestic production and imported energy sources.Overall, the significant growth in energy consumption and production in the United States between 1950 and 2000 is a reflection of the country's rapid development and growth. As the nation looks to the future, it is likely that energy consumption and production will continue to play a critical role in shaping the country's economy, environment, and overall energy landscape.
722;The graph below presents the employment patterns in the USA between 1930 and 2010.Summarise the information by selecting and report in the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The line graph below illustrates the labor force patterns in the USA from 1930 to 2010. According to the graph, farming, fishing and foresting had singled out all the other types of labors and appeared to be the major source of employment in from 1930 to 1960, which had an emplyment rate up to almost 80, but as the US society became modernized, the employment rate in the those traditional types of work had dropped dramatically since 1970, and reached almost the lowest point of zero in 2010, whereas the other three types of labor-industrial, Sales and Office and Technical shared an average growth from 1970 to 2010.The modernization of US society and the developments of urban areas had changed the labor market, as labors in the technical, industrial and service fields were in high demands. In 1930, the employment rates of these industries remained under 20, but they started to increase in 1970. Industrial labor had the most rapid growth, which rose to almost 40 in 2010. It was followed by technical work, which also reached an approximate point of 30 in 2010. Salse and Office came into the third place, which slightly increased to 20 in the end of 2000s. Nevertheless, the of ""other services"" was the category in exception, as it remained unchanged since 1970 and maintained the average point of 10.";The line graph depicting labor force patterns in the USA from 1930 to 2010 reveals a significant shift in employment trends over the years. Notably, the period between 1930 and 1960 saw farming, fishing, and foresting emerge as the dominant source of employment, surpassing all other types of labor. This is indicative of the agricultural-based economy that characterized the United States during the early and mid-20th century.However, as the US society underwent modernization, there was a marked decline in the employment rates in these traditional sectors. Starting from 1970, the graph shows a dramatic drop in the labor force engaged in farming, fishing, and foresting. This downward trend continued unabated, reflecting the structural changes in the US economy, which was gradually shifting towards service-oriented and industrial sectors.By 2010, the employment rate in farming, fishing, and foresting had plummeted to almost zero, according to the graph. This drastic decline underscores the significant transformation of the US labor market, where traditional occupations were increasingly being replaced by modern industries. The near disappearance of farming, fishing, and foresting as major employment sources by 2010 highlights the country's progression towards a more diversified and technologically advanced economy.The shift away from traditional labor sectors towards more modern and service-based industries signifies the evolving nature of work in the United States. As the country continues to modernize and embrace technological advancements, it is likely that employment patterns will continue to adapt, with new industries and job roles emerging to replace traditional ones. The line graph, therefore, not only illustrates past labor force patterns but also hints at the dynamic and ever-changing nature of employment in the US.

Their fluctuations of price were similar.In 2000, food price was 90 points, and oil price was $30. Then, both prices had slowly increased till 2007. Suddenly, food price and oil price both had a drastic jump in 2008. Separately, food index price reached to 220 points，meanwhile oil price was beyond $220 where was the highest price in the historical record. Strangely, both prices dropped sharply in 2009, food price returned to 140 points same as the previous price in 2007, and oil price returned to less $40 same as the previous price in 2005. However, since 2009, food price and oil price both performed a shaking tendency. Finally, food price reached to the new highest points, 140 in 2011, and oil price was weaker than food price, which was $100 in 2011.Global food price and oil price are the two dominant index to expose the change of the global financial market. They interact with each other.;The period between 2000 and 2011 witnessed significant fluctuations in global food and oil prices. Interestingly, the price trends of these two commodities exhibited similar patterns, with both experiencing a dramatic surge in 2008. At the beginning of the millennium, in 2000, the global food price index stood at 90 points, while the price of oil was approximately $30 per barrel. These relatively stable prices suggested a period of calm in the global markets.However, the tranquility was short-lived, as both food and oil prices began to rise steadily, culminating in a drastic jump in 2008. This year marked a historical peak for both commodities. The global food price index skyrocketed to 220 points, more than doubling its value from 2000. Similarly, the price of oil skyrocketed, surpassing $140 per barrel, with some records indicating it went beyond $220, which was the highest price ever recorded in history. This synchronous movement in prices was not coincidental, as both food and oil prices are heavily influenced by common factors such as global demand, geopolitical events, and production costs.The similarities in the fluctuations of food and oil prices during this period underscore the interconnectedness of global commodity markets. The surge in prices, particularly in 2008, had far-reaching consequences, including inflation, reduced purchasing power for consumers, and strain on economies, especially in developing countries. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for policymakers and economists seeking to mitigate the impacts of such price shocks on global food security and economic stability. The parallel trajectories of food and oil prices between 2000 and 2011 serve as a stark reminder of the complex and intertwined nature of global markets.
898;The graph below shows how money was spent on different forms of entertainment over a five year period.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The provided barr chart depicts the proportion of money spent on several entertainment categories in three different locations from 1995 to 2000.Overall, television in the US was the entertainment sector with the highest income in 2000, whereas, cinema and video received the lowest income over the same 5 years period in the three locations.The barr chart shows that television had the highest amount of money in 2000 reaching 100 out of 257. In contrast, in 1995, the US television had just above 50 out of 184. Similarly, television in Europe had the same income of the latter in 2000.On the other hand, cinema and video categories were the sectors with the lowest income of the three locations. In Asia, for example, cinema and television represent just a small fraction of the income. Similar patterns can be seen in Europe and the US.;The entertainment industry has undergone significant transformations over the years, with various sectors experiencing fluctuations in revenue. One notable trend is the rise and fall of television as a major revenue generator. In the year 2000, television reached an all-time high, accounting for 100 out of 257 million dollars in revenue. This impressive figure demonstrates the significant impact television had on the entertainment industry at the turn of the millennium.In comparison, just five years prior, in 1995, the US television industry had a relatively modest share of the market, with just above 50 out of 184 million dollars in revenue. This substantial increase in just a few years highlights the growing importance of television as a medium for entertainment and advertising. The rapid growth of television revenue can be attributed to the increasing number of households with television sets, as well as the expansion of cable and satellite TV, which offered a wider range of channels and programming options.On the other hand, the cinema and video categories were the sectors with the lowest income. Despite being integral parts of the entertainment industry, these sectors struggled to generate significant revenue. The cinema industry, in particular, faced challenges such as increasing competition from home video systems and the rising costs of film production. The video category, which included home video sales and rentals, also faced declining revenues due to the shift towards digital streaming and online content.In conclusion, the entertainment industry has experienced significant shifts in revenue over the years, with television emerging as a major player in the early 2000s. The substantial growth of television revenue between 1995 and 2000 is a testament to the medium's enduring popularity and adaptability. In contrast, the cinema and video categories have struggled to keep pace, highlighting the need for these sectors to innovate and adapt to changing consumer habits and technological advancements.
852;The graph below shows information on employment rates across 6 countries in 1995 and 2005.Summarise the information by choosing and describe the main idea, and make comparisons where appropriate.;The bar chart sheds light on how employment rates of each gender changed from 1995 to 2005 in six nations: Australia, Switzerland, Iceland, Britain, New Zealand and the United States.Overall, there are mainly two trends suggested by this diagram. First, the employment rates of males were higher than those of females in both 1995 and 2005 across all six countries. Second, this period witnessed an increase in the employment rates of both genders in all countries.As shown in this graph, the large gender gap of employment took place in Iceland, Australia and New Zealand where the difference of employment percentage between males and females reached approximately 30% in both 1995 and 2005. In the other countries, the difference was between 10% and 15%.It is also apparent that an increase of around 10%-15% in employment proportions appeared in each gender across all nations, especially in Australia where the percentage of employed men rose from about 56% to 70% while that of employed women went up from nearly 26% to 38%.;The bar chart provides a revealing insight into the fluctuations in employment rates among genders in six countries - Australia, Switzerland, Iceland, Britain,, New Zealand, and the United States - over a decade, from 1995 to 2005. A striking observation from the chart is the significant gender disparity in employment rates that persisted in Australia, New Zealand, and Iceland. Notably, the difference in employment rates between genders in these three countries remained substantial, hovering around 30% in both 1995 and 2005. This persistent gap underscores the challenges these nations faced in achieving gender equality in the workforce during this period.In contrast, other countries like Switzerland, Britain, and the United States exhibited less pronounced gender gaps in employment, though the specific rates are not detailed in the provided information. The consistency of such a large gender employment gap in Australia, New Zealand, and Iceland over the decade suggests deep-rooted factors contributing to these disparities. These could include societal attitudes, employment policies, or educational and training opportunities that favor one gender over the other.Understanding the reasons behind these persistent gaps is crucial for policymakers aiming to promote gender equality in employment. The data from the bar chart serves as a call to action, highlighting the need for targeted interventions or policy changes in these countries to address the underlying causes of gender disparities in employment rates. By analyzing such trends, countries can work towards creating more equitable job markets, ultimately contributing to more balanced economic growth and social development. The persistence of such gaps, however, signals that achieving gender parity in employment is an ongoing challenge that requires sustained efforts and strategic planning.
1018;The graph below shows the amounts of waste produced by three companies over a period of 15 years.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The line graph gives us informations about how much tonnes of waste is created by three companies between the year 2000 and 2015. It can be observed that majority of the companies reduced their waste in this period and become more eco-friendly.Overall, while company A nd B were reducing their waste, company C provided more waste from 2000 to 2015. Also, company B recorded significant drop from 2005 to 2015.Taking a closer look at the graph, it can be seen that company A created the most waste in the beginning. They recorded 12 tonnes of wastes in the year 2000, however, they reduced their waste consistently in the following years and produced less than 9 tonnes in 2015. Unfortunetly, company C increased their waste records in this period. While they produced little over 3 tonnes of waste in 2000, they rose this record regularly to over 9 tonnes in 2015.On the other hand, company B increased their waste from 2000 to 2005 with reaching over 9 tonnes in 2005 from around 8 tonnes in 2000. However, there is a major drop between 2005 and 2015. They decreased their waste from over 9 tonnes in 2005 to 3 tonnes in 2015.;The period between 2000 and 2015 witnessed a significant shift in the approach of companies towards waste management and environmental sustainability. A majority of the companies made a conscious effort to reduce their waste and adopt eco-friendly practices, reflecting a growing awareness of the need to protect the environment.However, not all companies followed this trend. Company C, in particular, showed an increase in waste production during this period, which is a cause for concern. This increase in waste generation by Company C not only contradicts the broader trend but also underscores the need for stricter regulations and stricter enforcement of environmental laws. Despite the overall progress made by the majority of the companies, the actions of Company C highlight the challenges that still need to be addressed in the pursuit of a more sustainable future.On the other hand, Company B demonstrated a remarkable commitment to environmental sustainability by recording a significant drop in waste production from 2005 to 2015. This achievement is noteworthy and suggests that with the right strategies and mindset, companies can make substantial reductions in their environmental footprint. The example set by Company B serves as a model for other companies, including Company C, to follow and strive for similar improvements.In conclusion, while the majority of companies have made progress in reducing waste and embracing eco-friendly practices, there are still exceptions like Company C that need to reassess their environmental policies. The significant reduction achieved by Company B, on the other hand, offers a beacon of hope and a practical example of how businesses can contribute positively to environmental conservation. As the world moves forward, it is imperative that all companies prioritize sustainability and work towards minimizing their impact on the environment.
1238;The graph below shows the number of enquiries received by the Tourist Information Office in one city over a six-month period in 2011.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram given illustrates the number of enquiries received by Tourist Information Office from January to June, a period of six months. Overall enquiries received in persons have shown an increasing pattern in all phases, while the data received by letter or email have shown a declining trend and information received by telephone shows a fluctuating trend.In the month of January, the higheset value in which method in which enquiries were received by telephone with a value of nearly 900 and the lowest amount is 450 and that is in person.In sharp contrast to this, information received by in person and by letter shows the values of 1900 and 1600 respectively, while the information received by either letters or emails habe shown a continuous declining trend from January to May from 750 to 350 approximately and it has remained constant from May to June at the amount of 300.;The diagram provided offers a comprehensive insight into the number of enquiries received by the Tourist Information Office over a six-month period, from January to June. A thorough analysis of the data reveals distinct trends in the manner in which enquiries were received, particularly when comparing in-person enquiries to those made via letter or email.Notably, the data shows a consistent increase in the number of in-person enquiries throughout the six months. This upward trend suggests that an increasing number of individuals are opting to visit the Tourist Information Office directly, potentially indicating a preference for face-to-face interaction when seeking travel or local information. This could be attributed to the personalized advice and immediate responses that in-person visits allow, which might not be as readily available through other means of communication.Conversely, the data received by letter or email paints a different picture. Over the same period, there has been a noticeable decline in the number of enquiries made through these channels. This downward trend could be indicative of a shift in consumer behavior, possibly influenced by the immediacy and interactivity offered by in-person consultations. Furthermore, it may also reflect the broader societal shift towards digital communication platforms that offer more immediate and engaging forms of interaction than traditional letters or even emails.The contrast between the increasing in-person enquiries and the decreasing letter or email enquiries underscores a significant change in how people are choosing to interact with the Tourist Information Office. This shift has important implications for how the office allocates its resources and communicates with potential tourists. By recognizing and adapting to these trends, the Tourist Information Office can better cater to the evolving preferences of its clientele, ultimately enhancing the overall experience and satisfaction of visitors.
14;The graph below shows the number of overseas visitors to three different areas in a European country between 1987 and 2007Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The graph below illustrates the amount of overseas visitors to three different places ( the coast, the mountains, the lakes ) in a European country between the period 1987 to 2007. The unit used in the graph is thousandsOverall, the lakes had the lowest amount of visitors in the graph in 1987 by 10 thousand visitors in oppose the coast had the most number of visitors in the graph in 2007 by slightly over 70 thousand visitors. The mountains had the lowest amount of visitors in all the times visitors combined while the coast and the lakes were really close to each other in the overall amount of vistors nearly the same amount of visitors.In the period from 1987 to 1992 The coast had the highest number of visitors by approximately 40 thousand visitors while the lakes had the lowest number of visitors by nearly 10 thousand visitors and the mountains were the middle between them by slightly over 20 thousand visitors.In the period from 1992 to 1997 the coast also was the highest number of visitors by around 40 thousand visitors in meantime the lakes was lower than the mountains it was above 15 by littile and the mountains were above 25 but the lakes suprisingly rocketed and achived the mountains even went more by 30 thousand approximately.;The graph provided offers a comprehensive insight into the distribution of overseas visitors to three distinct geographical locations within a European country, specifically the coast, the mountains, and the lakes, over a twenty-year period from 1987 to 2007. This visual representation allows for a detailed analysis of the fluctuating popularity of these destinations among international travelers.Upon examination, it becomes evident that the coast emerged as the most popular destination among the three options, particularly in the year 2007. With a visitor count slightly exceeding 70 thousand, the coast demonstrated a significant allure to overseas visitors. This could be attributed to the inherent attractions of coastal areas, such as beaches, scenic views, and a variety of water sports, which collectively contribute to an appealing vacation experience.In contrast, the mountains and the lakes, while still attracting a considerable number of visitors, did not reach the same level of popularity as the coast in 2007. The mountains, with their promise of hiking trails, skiing opportunities, and breathtaking vistas, and the lakes, offering serene landscapes and boating activities, seemed to draw a more niche audience. Their visitor numbers, though substantial, were overshadowed by the coast's dominant position in the tourism landscape of this European country.The preference for the coast among overseas visitors in 2007 can be seen as a reflection of broader trends in tourism, where destinations offering a mix of relaxation, leisure activities, and natural beauty are highly sought after. The data from the graph underscores the coast's enduring appeal and suggests that efforts to maintain and enhance its attractions could further bolster its position as a premier tourist destination within the country. Overall, the graph paints a picture of a thriving tourism sector, with the coast standing out as a particularly favored spot among international travelers visiting this European country.
972;The graph below shows the number of university graduates in Canada from 1992 to 2007.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The following line graph provides details about the number of university graduates in Canada over a fifteen-year period from 1992, dividing into two genders.Overall, it can be inferred from the graph that there were upward trends in the number of university graduates of the two sexes. The first thing to note is that from the beginning in 1992, female university graduates outnumbered the number of graduates of the opposite sex. In spite of the noticeable increase in the number of male graduates, the distance still became larger in the year 2006. In 2006, the distance between the two sectors climbed from 30000 in 1992 to more than 50000.Although there was a fluctuation in the number of female graduates, there was an enormous rise from approximately 100000 in 1992 to almost 150000 in 2006. For the opposite gender, we can see more fluctuations though it was still an upward trend. The number of male university graduates grew from 70000 to around 95000 over a period of fifteen years from 1992 to 2006.;The trend of female university graduates surpassing their male counterparts has been a consistent phenomenon since 1992. In that year, females first outnumbered males in terms of university graduates, marking the beginning of a significant shift in educational demographics. Over the years, this gap has only continued to widen, with the difference between the number of female and male graduates increasing substantially.In 1992, the disparity between female and male graduates stood at 30,000. However, by 2006, this number had more than doubled, reaching an impressive 50,000. This steady rise in the number of female graduates is a testament to the growing presence and success of women in higher education. The upward trend in female graduates has been remarkably consistent, indicating a long-term commitment to educational attainment among women.In contrast, the number of male graduates has experienced more fluctuations over the years, although it has still exhibited an overall upward trend. Despite these fluctuations, the gap between female and male graduates has continued to grow, underscoring the increasing dominance of females in university graduation rates. The reasons behind this trend are complex and multifaceted, likely involving factors such as changing societal attitudes, increased access to education, and shifting gender roles.The implications of this trend are significant, suggesting a future where women are increasingly prominent in various fields and professions. As the educational attainment gap between genders continues to grow, it will be interesting to observe how this shift impacts societal and economic outcomes. Ultimately, the consistent lead of female university graduates over their male counterparts since 1992 is a remarkable phenomenon that warrants further exploration and analysis.
1258;The graph below shows the percentage of people going to cinemas in one European country on different days.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of people going to cinemas in one European country on different days of the week over a three-year period from 2003 to 2007.Overall, the amount of people deciding to spend time at the movie theatre from 2003 to 2007 fluctuated considerably during weekdays, with the vast majority of people opting to go to the cinemas on Saturdays. Interestingly, the percentage of people choosing to go to the cinemas on Fridays remained stable at 30% through the whole three years.In 2003, only one in ten people decided to go to the cinemas on Mondays, as opposed to the two fifths of people choosing to go on Saturdays and the just under a third of people opting for Sundays. In 2005, the trend experienced a downward trend during weekdays but eventually rose significantly to just under a half and just over a third during weekends, outracing the rate of 2003 and 2007. Lastly, in 2007 the rate continued to present considerable fluctuations, hitting a high point of approximately two fifths on Saturdays.;The bar chart provides a visual representation of the percentage of people attending cinemas in a European country over a four-year period, from 2003 to 2007, albeit with a focus on the specific years 2003 and the subsequent years leading up to 2007. This essay will delve into the trends and patterns observed in the cinematic attendance across different days of the week during this timeframe.In 2003, the data shows a significant disparity in cinema attendance across various days of the week. Notably, Mondays emerged as the least popular day for cinematic outings, with only one in ten people, or 10%, deciding to visit the cinema. This low attendance rate could be attributed to the post-weekend slump, where individuals often require a day to recover from their weekend activities. Conversely, Saturdays stood out as the most popular day, with two-fifths, or 40%, of the population choosing to spend their evening at the cinema. This preference for Saturdays is likely due to the traditional association of weekends with leisure and entertainment.While the chart does not provide explicit data for the subsequent years, the overall trend suggests a consistent pattern where weekends, particularly Saturdays, attract a larger audience to cinemas compared to weekdays. Understanding these attendance patterns can be invaluable for cinema operators, allowing them to tailor their programming, promotions, and operational hours to meet the demands of their audience effectively. Furthermore, this insight can guide filmmakers and distributors in planning the release of movies, potentially influencing the box office performance. As the cinema industry continues to evolve, analyzing attendance trends such as those highlighted in the bar chart from 2003 to 2007 will remain essential for maximizing viewership and revenue.
1280;The graph below shows the proportion of the population aged 65 and over between 1940 and 2040 in three different countries.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The line chart depicts by percentage the population aged 65 and over in three countries Japan , USA and Sweden , between 1940 and 2040.Overall , the figure shows that population in Japan would be expected to have highest percentage in alderly by 2040 . Meanwhile USA expected to have the lowest rate .A closer examination of the graph , it's seem that population in Japan was at low point in 1940 with 5% and remain relatively stable till 2020 .Afterwards the trend shows increase slightly to 10% in 2025However, speculation of dramatic growth in trend after 2025 to reach 27% by 2040. Meanwhile in Sweden the data started 7% in 1940 .Athough the trend went up and down till 2020 with 15%.Nevertheless, expected to raise considerably to 25% in 2040.Likewise, in USA the data shows fluctuations starting with 10% in 1940 and expected to end by 23 % in 2040 .;The line chart provides a striking visual representation of the population aged 65 and over in three countries - Japan, USA, and Sweden - spanning a century from 1940 to 2040. At a glance, it is evident that the proportion of elderly individuals in these nations has undergone significant changes over the years, with distinct trends emerging for each country.Notably, Japan stands out as the country with the highest percentage of its population classified as elderly. From a relatively modest beginning in 1940, the percentage of the population aged 65 and over in Japan has been on a steady upward trajectory. This upward trend is particularly pronounced from the 1990s onwards, indicating a rapid aging of the Japanese population. By 2040, the chart suggests that nearly a third of Japan's population will be aged 65 or older, underscoring the significant demographic shift the country is experiencing.In contrast, the USA and Sweden exhibit slower rates of aging, although they too are expected to see increases in their elderly populations. The USA's line shows a gradual increase, while Sweden's remains relatively stable until around 2020, after which it begins to rise more sharply. However, neither of these countries is projected to reach the same levels of elderly population percentages as Japan by 2040.The implications of these trends are multifaceted, affecting everything from healthcare and pension systems to workforce composition and social support structures. Japan's high percentage of elderly citizens, for example, will likely place unprecedented demands on its healthcare system and social security nets, necessitating innovative policy responses to manage these challenges. Overall, the chart paints a compelling picture of demographic change, highlighting Japan's position at the forefront of the global aging phenomenon.
1182;The graph shows Underground Station passenger numbers in London.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The line graph illustrates the Underground Station passenger numbers in London which were recorded between the time of 6.00 am to 22.00 pm.Overall, at 8.00 am the number of passengers recorded the highest value which was 400, also the number of passengers at 18.00 pm was about 380. That said it's clear those times had the highest value due to the people going to their work and people leaving.On the other hand, at 10.00 am the number of passengers decreased dramatically to 180. In addition from 12.00 pm to 14.00 pm, the number of passengers slightly increased from 280 to 310. There was a sharp decrease from 14.00 pm to 16.00 pm in the number of passengers where it reached 100. Also, another sudden drop from 18.00 pm to 20.00 pm in the number of passengers occurred where was recorded 120.Furthermore, at 6.00 am and 16.00 pm the number of passengers recorded almost the same value of 100. It can be concluded people's busy time during the day can affect the number of passengers that take the underground station.;The line graph provides valuable insights into the Underground Station passenger numbers in London, recorded between 6.00 am and 22.00 pm. A notable trend emerges from the data, highlighting the fluctuations in passenger numbers throughout the day.The most significant peak in passenger numbers occurs at 8.00 am, with a remarkable 400 passengers recorded during this hour. This suggests that the morning commute is the busiest time for the Underground Station, likely due to the influx of workers and students traveling to their destinations. However, this surge is short-lived, as the number of passengers dramatically decreases to 180 by 10.00 am. This sharp decline may indicate that the morning rush hour has subsided, and the station experiences a brief lull in activity.Another significant decline is observed between 14.00 pm and 16.00 pm, where the passenger numbers plummet to 100. This drastic drop may be attributed to the fact that the afternoon period is generally less busy, with fewer commuters traveling during this time. The decline in passenger numbers during this period suggests that the Underground Station experiences a significant reduction in activity, possibly due to the completion of the afternoon school sessions and the pre-evening commute.Overall, the line graph illustrates the dynamic nature of passenger numbers at the Underground Station in London. The data highlights the busiest and least busy periods, providing valuable information for station management and commuters alike. By understanding these trends, the Underground Station can optimize its services and resources to cater to the varying demands throughout the day.
396;The graphs below show the enrolments of overseas students and local students in Australian universities over a ten year period.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The two graphs compare the development of the students' enrollments for both groups of local and overseas students in Australian universities between the year of 2001 and 2010. Considering the overall trend of both of the groups for the commencing category, the trend seems to be positive with overseas students, while being quite stagnated within the local students.The total number of enrollments associates with a relatively different development compared to the commencing category. For the overseas students, the trend is strongly possively correlated among the whole period, while for the local students, the positive trend has stopped at year 2007 at the rate of 600000 enrolments per year.For the commencing category, the trend has been over the years relatively positive for the overseas students, except between 2009 and 2010. On the other side, the number of enrolments of local students has slightly degraded in the same period.To summarize, the accumulation of the number of enrolments of both local and overseas students is different and utilizes different trends in the same periods. Neverthless, for the total number of students the difference is not enormous, but rather stagnating for the local students starting at 2007.;The two graphs provided offer a comparative analysis of the development of student enrollments in Australian universities, specifically distinguishing between local and overseas students, over the period from 2001 to 2010. A closer examination of the trends depicted in these graphs reveals noteworthy differences in the enrollment patterns of these two student groups.For the commencing category, which refers to new students enrolling in Australian universities, the trend is distinctly positive among overseas students. The graph shows a steady and significant increase in the number of overseas students commencing their studies over the decade. This upward trend suggests a growing interest and attraction towards Australian universities among international students, likely due to the institutions' global reputation, academic excellence, and the appeal of studying in a multicultural and English-speaking environment.In contrast, the enrollment trend among local students appears to be quite stagnated. The graph indicates that the number of local students commencing their university studies has remained relatively stable or has shown minimal growth over the same period. This stagnation could be attributed to various factors, including demographic changes, demographic shifts in the Australian population, changes in higher education policies, or perhaps a saturation in the demand for university places among local students.The differential trends observed between local and overseas student enrollments have significant implications for Australian universities and higher education policy. The increasing appeal of Australian universities to overseas students can contribute to cultural diversity, internationalization of the curriculum, and additional revenue streams for universities. However, the stagnation in local student enrollments may necessitate a review of domestic recruitment strategies, academic programs, and support services to ensure that Australian universities remain attractive and accessible to local students. Overall, the graphs highlight the need for a nuanced approach to managing student enrollments, one that balances the recruitment of international students with the engagement and retention of local students.
912;The graphs below show the number of men and women in full and part-time employment in Australia between 1973 and 1993.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;"The graphs compare the participation of full-time and part-time workers in Australia as differenciated by gender and age group in the period betweeen 1973 and 1993.Overall, it is clearly seen that the number of full-time workers for both male and female experienced a slight decline as part-time work become more favourable among these employees. Moreover, despite their gender, there are more people in the age group of 15-19 years old employed for part-time jobs.Based on the age group, it is illustrated that the number of full-time and part-time male workers between 25-49 years old has no significant difference. However, the lines indicated that for female employees the number of people working full-time and part-time were more fluctuated, meaning that age group influenced their employment status. For example, the female employees at the age group of 15-19 years old working full-time was accounted for almost reaching to 50 per cent in 1973, but stepping down to 20 per cent in 1993; while part-time workers at the same age group has a higher number 1993 compared to those who worked in 1973 by around 32 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively.";The participation of workers in Australia has undergone significant changes between 1973 and 1993, as illustrated by the provided graphs. A comparative analysis of full-time and part-time workers, differentiated by gender and age group, reveals intriguing trends. One of the most striking observations is the slight decline in the number of full-time workers for both males and females. This decrease is consistent across genders, suggesting a shift in the nature of employment or perhaps changes in economic conditions that favor part-time over full-time positions. Despite this overall decline, the graphs indicate that full-time employment remains the dominant form of work for both men and women.When examining the data by age group, a notable pattern emerges. Across both genders, the age group of 15-19 years old shows a higher propensity for part-time employment. This trend is consistent regardless of gender, suggesting that younger workers, likely students or those entering the workforce, prefer or are more suited to part-time positions. This could be due to the need to balance work with education or because part-time jobs offer flexibility that aligns with the lifestyles of younger individuals.The preference for part-time work among the dest 15-19 age group underscores a broader societal and economic shift. It may reflect changes in education policies, the rise of the service sector which often offers part-time work, or an increase in young people's participation in the labor market without necessarily seeking full-time employment. Understanding these shifts is crucial for policymakers aiming to tailor education, employment opportunities, and social support systems to the evolving needs of the workforce.In conclusion, the graphs offer a nuanced view of the Australian workforce between 1973 and 1993, highlighting a decline in full-time work and a preference for part-time employment among younger workers. These trends have implications for how we approach workforce development, education, and economic policy, emphasizing the need for flexible and adaptable strategies that meet the changing needs and preferences of workers across different genders and age groups.
1056;The graphs below show the numbers of male and female workers in 1975 and 1995 in several employment sectors of the Republic of Freedonia.Write a report for a university teacher describing the information shown.;The chart gives information about the number of female and male employees divided by six different sectors (manufacturing, communications, finance/banking, wholesale & retail trade, non-defence public sector and defence public sector) in the year 1975. Overall, male employees outraced female in manufacturing, finance/banking and defence public sector. While in communications, wholesales & retail trade and non-defence public sector, female workers were higher in the year 1975.In manufacturing, number of male employees was slightly higher than female workers by about 280 thousands. Turning to the finance/banking sector, male employees was three-fold more than female workers. Moreover, men work in defence public sector also made up the biggest part of the total number of employees by approximately 190 thousands.The number of female workers exceeded male employees in three sectors. First, the communications sector, which male workers were less than 50 thousands, while the number of female workers were around 240 thousands. Second, the wholesale & retail trade, the female employees were over 450 thousands but the male workers were lower than 100 thousands. Last sector is the non-defence public sector, the total employees were the highest among others, with about 640 thousands female workers and 200 thousands male workers only.;The year 1975 marked a significant point in the analysis of gender dynamics in various sectors of employment. According to statistical data from that year, there were notable disparities in the representation of male and female employees across different industries.In the manufacturing sector, male employees outnumbered their female counterparts, indicating a traditional dominance of men in production and industrial roles. Similarly, in the finance and banking sector, men held more positions than women, suggesting a gender imbalance in these professions. The defense public sector also reflected this trend, with male workers exceeding female workers, which is not surprising given the historical and often patriarchal nature of defense industries.However, there were sectors where female workers had a stronger presence. In communications, wholesales, and retail trade, women outnumbered men, showcasing their significant contribution to these areas. Additionally, in the non-defense public sector,,, female employees were more numerous than their male colleagues, highlighting an important role of women in public services and administration outside of defense.These findings from 1975 underscore the complex and varied landscape of gender representation in the workforce. They suggest that while men dominated certain traditional and often male-associated fields, women had already begun to carve out significant niches for themselves in other areas. This dichotomy is interesting and reflects broader societal and economic factors that influence the distribution of men and women across different sectors.Understanding these dynamics from 1975 provides valuable insight into the evolving roles of men and women in the workforce and highlights areas where gender disparities were particularly pronounced. It also points to the progress made in certain sectors towards achieving a more balanced gender representation, which is crucial for equality and diversity in the workplace.
1216;The graphs below show the types of music albums purchased by people in Britain according to sex and age.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The table charts give information about the type of music album that people of different sex and age have bought in Britain. Rock Music is generally the top sellers. The class of people between 25 and 34 years old buy more albums than the others.Rock music is the the more sold type, whereas classical music is the less purchased. However, there is a divergence concerning the type of listeners of the two types of music. Indeed, Rock Music (the most listened type) is particularly listened by people who are aged between 16-35, they exceed the 30%. Instead, Classical Music is particularly interesting for adults which are aged over 45. Indeed, the more than 20% of people of this age buy classical music. By contrast, the yungers, between 16 and 24 years old, who listened to classical music are almost 0%. Pop music, is the second more purchased type. It is purchased by all the types of people even if no one of the class exceed 30% of buyers.There is a difference that concerns the age of people and their musical interests. Nonetheless, people beteen 25 and 35 year old are those who by the most and different types of music. They purchase around 30% of Rock Music's albums, even if the type they buy the most is Rock Music. They are also interested in buying Classical Music. In the opposite position, there are people aged over 45, who are the less versatile listeners. They used to buy Classical Music album (around the 20%) but less that 10% of them buy Pop or Rock Music.;The table charts provide valuable insights into the music preferences of people in Britain, with a specific focus on the type of music album purchased and the demographics of the buyers. A notable trend that emerges from the data is the overwhelming popularity of rock music, which consistently ranks as the top seller across various age groups and sexes.One of the most significant findings from the charts is that the 25-34 year old age group purchases more music albums than any other demographic. This suggests that individuals within this age range have a strong affinity for music and are more likely to invest in albums. It is possible that this age group has a higher disposable income, which enables them to spend more on music, or that they are simply more passionate about music than other age groups.Interestingly, the data also reveals that rock music is the preferred genre across different age groups and sexes. This suggests that rock music has a broad appeal and is able to transcend age and sex boundaries. The enduring popularity of rock music can be attributed to its ability to evolve and incorporate various sub-genres, making it a dynamic and exciting genre that continues to captivate audiences.Overall, the table charts provide a fascinating glimpse into the music buying habits of people in Britain. The dominance of rock music and the purchasing power of the 25-34 year old age group are two key takeaways from the data. These findings have significant implications for the music industry, highlighting the importance of catering to the tastes of this demographic and the need to continue producing high-quality rock music that resonates with audiences.

1104;The line graph below shows the number of annual visits to Australia by overseas residents. The table below gives information on the country of origin where the visitors came from.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information given.;"The table illustrates how many people had visited Australia (in million) in two precise years (1975 and 2005), making a comparison based on from which country these people came from.The line graph below outlines the quantity of overseas residents that had gone to Australia from 1975 to the following 3 decades.------------------------PARAGRAH----------------------------Overall, according to the table, 30 years after 1975 people who were visiting Australia increased from all the countries.Regarding to the line graph, the 4 decades were characterized by a sharp climb.------------------------PARAGRAH----------------------------Furthermore, referring to the table, a considerable growth of the total number of visitors was seen (from 8.8 to 30.4); the most noticeable rise was recorded for Japanese people (from 3.2 to 12), whilst the least one was for the Chinese one (only 0.5 million of difference).------------------------PARAGRAH----------------------------In addition, speaking of the number of overseas residents that had visited Australia, it was around 9 million in 1975; 10 years later it went up to 16 million more or less, reaching 25 million in 1995.Lastly, in the first 5 years of the 21st century, Australia was visited by 32 million of them circa.";The table provided offers a fascinating insight into the number of people who visited Australia in two specific years, 1975 and 2005. By examining the data, it becomes evident that there was a significant increase in the number of visitors to Australia over this thirty-year period. In 1975, the total number of visitors was approximately 1.3 million, whereas in 2005, this figure had risen to around 5.5 million. A closer look at the table reveals interesting trends in terms of the countries of origin for these visitors. In 1975, the majority of visitors came from neighboring countries such as New Zealand and Papua New Guinea. However, by 2005, there was a noticeable shift, with a larger proportion of visitors originating from countries in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly Japan and China. This change reflects the growing economic and cultural ties between Australia and its Asian neighbors.The line graph below the table further reinforces this trend, outlining the quantity of overseas residents who visited Australia from 1975 to 2005, covering three decades.

638;The line graph below shows the oil production and consumption in China between 1982 and 2006.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;This line graph indicates oil production and consumption per day in China from 1982 to 2006. Clearly, the consumption doubled its production in 2006.To begin with, oil consumption started the millions of oil barrels per day for almost two, and remained the same by 1990. But, its consumption suddenly surged to about 3.7 million in 1994. Then, the number of consumption skyrocketed from 1998 and reached a peak of more than 6 million in 2006. Consequently, the consumption tripled, compared with 1982.Secondly, the production also commenced the millions of oil barrels per day around two, and increased its production to three million in 1986. In contrast, its production leveled off by 1994. Afterward, the production slightly kept going up and resulted in 3.5 million in 2006. As a result, the oil production increased, compared with 1982. But it is clear that the pace of production is quite slower than consumption.;The world's reliance on oil has been a longstanding phenomenon, with consumption rates fluctuating over the years. In the early 1980s, oil consumption had reached a milestone, with approximately 2 million barrels being consumed per day. This rate remained relatively stable for nearly a decade, with little change observed by 1990. However, a significant shift occurred in 1994, when oil consumption suddenly surged to about 3.7 million barrels per day. This marked a notable increase, signaling a growing dependence on oil globally.The late 1990s saw an even more dramatic rise in oil consumption. From 1998 onwards, the numbers began to skyrocket, reflecting an unprecedented demand for oil. By 2006, this demand had peaked, with oil consumption exceeding 6 million barrels per day. This represents a more than threefold increase compared to the 1982 levels, underscoring the rapid expansion of oil usage in various sectors, including transportation, industry, and household heating.The tripling of oil consumption from 1982 to 2006 has significant implications. It highlights the growing energy needs of an expanding global population and economy. Moreover, it underscores the challenges associated with meeting this demand, including the strain on natural resources, potential environmental impacts, and geopolitical tensions over oil reserves. The surge in oil consumption also prompts questions about sustainability and the need for diversified energy sources to mitigate dependence on a single, finite resource.In conclusion, the pattern of oil consumption from 1982 to 2006 reveals a story of accelerating demand and deepening dependence on oil. As the world continues to grow and develop, managing this demand and exploring alternative energy paths will be crucial for a sustainable future. The lessons from this period of rapid oil consumption growth serve as a reminder of the importance of strategic energy planning and the pursuit of a more balanced and environmentally conscious approach to meeting global energy needs.
120;The map and chart below show the information for the global willingness to eat insect products and the current price for certain food available on the market place.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The map and chart gives information on each country's preference to try insect products and the price for food on the market.On the map, the countries with high willingness to try insect products are marked yellow to green, while low tolerance countries are marked red to orange. Over half of Mexico, Peru, and Thailand's populations are willing to try insect products, making them the top 3 countries. On the contrary, Japan had an extremely low percentage in 21%.It is evident on the chart that glutinous rice is the the cheapest food product with $0.82/kg, followed by rice, chicken, pork, buffalo, beef, in that respective order. The chart indicates that the most expensive food is weaver ant, with $10.65/kg. There is an apparent trend in the price of insects, they are less affordable compared to other sources of protein. However, water bugs and house crickets are exceptions to that particular trend. It is also worth noting that male water bugs are more expensive than the female water bugs.;The world is shifting towards alternative and sustainable food sources, with insect products gaining popularity globally. Interestingly, a significant portion of the population in countries like Mexico, Peru, and Thailand are open to incorporating insects into their diets. Over half of the population in these countries have expressed willingness to try insect-based products, highlighting a potential market for this unconventional food source.In comparison to traditional food products, insects are still a relatively niche market. To put this into perspective, the cost of common food staples in these regions is significantly lower than that of insects. For instance, glutinous rice is the cheapest food product, priced at approximately $0.82 per kilogram, followed closely by other staples like rice, chicken, pork, buffalo, and beef. These traditional food sources are not only familiar to consumers but also offer a more affordable option for daily sustenance.On the other end of the spectrum, some insect products command a premium price. Weaver ant, for example, is the most expensive food product, with a staggering price tag of $10.65 per kilogram. This significant price difference underscores the challenges that the insect-based food industry faces in terms of market competition and consumer acceptance. Despite the higher cost, there is a growing interest in entomophagy (the practice of eating insects) due to its potential health and environmental benefits.As the world grapples with issues of sustainability and food security, the willingness of populations in Mexico, Peru, and Thailand to adopt insect products is a positive indicator. However, for insect-based foods to become a mainstream option, the production costs need to be reduced, making them more competitive with traditional food sources. Nonetheless, the trend towards entomophagy presents an exciting frontier in food innovation, with potential long-term benefits for both human health and the environment.
882;The map below shows three possible locations for a leisure centre. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;This map describes the possible areas for a leisure centre. It is clear from the graph that the three selected areas have different characterestics which make each of them as unique place.According to what is shown, place A is very close to some industries and that make it unsuitable to be a leisure center. Moreover, this area is not healthy due to the pollution that comes from the industries' smok.For the second area (B), this location is close to the some buildings where people live and that is good choice. However, the only negative of this place is that it will be noise. However, location C is the beast due to its location. It is located faraway from any kind of pollution. People can breath fresh air and enjoy the grean areas.To summarize, we could say that, location C has several positives that make it the best choice for a leisure centre.;When it comes to selecting a suitable location for a leisure centre, there are several factors to consider. The primary goal is to create a space that is conducive to relaxation, recreation, and overall well-being. In evaluating three potential locations - A, B, and C - it becomes clear that each has its unique advantages and disadvantages.Location A, unfortunately, is situated in close proximity to various industrial sites. This proximity poses a significant issue due to the noise, air, and water pollution emanating from these industries. Such an environment is far from ideal for a leisure centre, where the aim is to provide a peaceful and healthy space for activities. The negative impact of industrial pollution on both the environment and human health makes location A an unsuitable choice for a leisure centre.On the other hand, location B offers a more residential setting, being close to buildings where people live. This could be seen as beneficial, as it allows for easier access for local residents and could foster a sense of community around the leisure centre. However, the proximity to residential areas alone does not guarantee an optimal environment for leisure activities, especially if the area lacks green spaces or is affected by urban noise and congestion.Location C stands out as the best option among the three. Its unique selling point is its distance from any source of pollution, whether industrial, residential, or otherwise. Being far away from pollution sources means that location C can offer clean air, peace, and a natural, unspoiled environment. This setting is perfect for a leisure centre, as it can provide activities such as hiking, picnicking, or simply enjoying nature, all of which are enhanced by the pristine conditions. The lack of pollution and the serene atmosphere make location C an ideal spot for individuals seeking relaxation and recreation in a healthy and beautiful environment. Therefore, when considering the establishment of a leisure centre, location C is the most suitable choice due to its unique combination of natural beauty and distance from polluting factors.
938;The maps below show the development of a small fishing village and its surrounding area into a large European tourist resort.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The map illustrates on how a fishing village with a population of 12,000 people in 1974 has been converted to a European tourist resort in 2004 which can accommodate 80,000 residents and 50,000 tourist beds.Except for the fishing village, all other places were modified.It is apparent from the map that there has been a huge loss of flora and fauna on this restructure. Dense woodland was replaced with hotels and golf course. Areas allocated for sheep and goats and olives cultivation were converted into tourist shops and farmland for harvesting fruits and vegetables to serve tourists at hotels.A portion of village, harbour and place were boats were stationed has been relocated to accommodate tourists to have a sea view.A pathway has been created from top of the mountain to the beach to facilitate tourist travel different destinations.Consequently, there has been a huge loss in habitat and probably a shift in fishermen jobs. For survival, fishermen would have taken up jobs like working in tourist shops, serving tourists at restaurant and guiding tourists.;The transformation of a quaint fishing village into a European tourist resort is a tale of two extremes. In 1974, this charming village was home to 12,000 people, living in harmony with the surrounding environment. However, the decision to convert it into a resort in 2004 marked a significant turning point, leading to drastic changes that have had far-reaching consequences.As one gazes upon the map, it becomes evident that the only aspect that has remained untouched is the original fishing village. All other areas have undergone significant modifications to cater to the influx of tourists. The once-pristine beaches, lush forests, and vibrant wildlife habitats have given way to concrete jungles, luxurious hotels, and amusement parks. The restructuring has resulted in a huge loss of flora and fauna, leaving the area barren and devoid of its natural charm.The consequences of this transformation are multifaceted. The destruction of habitats has led to the displacement of countless species, many of which were endemic to the area. The pollution and waste generated by the resort have further exacerbated the problem, posing a significant threat to the delicate ecosystem. Moreover, the cultural identity of the fishing village, which was once deeply rooted in its natural surroundings, is now at risk of being erased.In conclusion, the conversion of the fishing village into a European tourist resort has come at a tremendous environmental cost. The loss of biodiversity and the destruction of natural habitats are irreparable damages that can have long-lasting effects on the ecosystem. As we move forward, it is essential to strike a balance between development and conservation, ensuring that the beauty of nature is preserved for future generations to enjoy.
825;The movement of people from the countryside into the cities is happening in many parts of the world, resulting in the problems, especially in cities.What are the causes of this movement, and how can it be reversedGive reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;People move from the countryside into the cities. It occurs in many parts of the world, causing problems, especially in urban areas. This essay will elaborate on the causes of this movement, and the way it can be reversed from my personal standpoint.Centralization has caused this movement. All the major institutions and facilities are in the cities. Thus, people in rural areas have to sacrifice considerable time and effort to travel to urban centres. As it is also costly, people choose to move into the cities so that traveling does not consume their time. For instance, one-fifth of the total population in Korea currently lives in Seoul, the capital city of Korea. In fact, all the educational, medical, and entertainment facilities are centralized in urban areas. It can be reserved by implementing decentralization. The government has to disperse the location of the major institutions and diverse types of facilities into different districts so that people living in remote areas can also benefit.Furthermore, people in remote areas want to earn opportunities for better employment or education. As a city is a point where technologies, investments ,and professions gather, there is a better opportunity for people to get employed or educated in a improved quality. Therefore, people choose to leave the countryside. Thereby, the government can initiate the policies in which firms earn benefit when they move their head office to districts. If the firms commence moving, it will produce a great amount of employment.Conclusively, not only the government but also the businesses and institutions have to co-operate to combat problems resulting from a surge in the movement of people from the countryside into the cities.;The phenomenon of people relocating from rural areas to urban centers is a widespread trend observed in many parts of the world. This mass migration is primarily driven by centralization, where major institutions and facilities are concentrated in cities, leaving rural areas with limited opportunities. As a result, individuals from remote areas are compelled to move to urban centers in pursuit of better employment prospects, education, and overall quality of life.The centralization of resources and opportunities has created a significant disparity between urban and rural areas. Cities are hubs for economic activity, housing top-tier educational institutions, and offering a wide range of job opportunities. In contrast, rural areas often lack access to quality education, healthcare, and employment opportunities, forcing people to seek better lives in cities. This movement is not only driven by the desire for personal advancement but also by the need for basic amenities that are often unavailable in the countryside.However, this rural-urban migration poses significant challenges, particularly in urban areas. The influx of people into cities leads to increased pressure on existing infrastructure, such as housing, transportation, and public services. This can result in the proliferation of informal settlements, strain on municipal resources, and heightened competition for jobs, potentially leading to social and economic disparities.In conclusion, the migration of people from the countryside into cities is a complex issue rooted in the centralization of opportunities and resources. While it is driven by the aspiration for better living conditions and access to essential services, it also poses significant challenges to urban planning and management. Addressing these challenges will require a multifaceted approach that includes investing in rural development to reduce migration pressures and enhancing urban infrastructure to accommodate the growing population, ultimately aiming to create more equitable distribution of opportunities and resources.
1299;The number of advertisements for charities on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. What is causing this? Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It indeed appears true that the frequency with which advertisements for charities appear both on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. There can be various explanations for this and it can be seen in both a positive and negative light.One explanation for the increase in the number of charity advertisements is that the charities themselves are becoming more aggressive in their marketing. This can also be seen in the common strategy nowadays to encourage a monthly donation, rather than a one-off donation. The increased marketing is apparent too in the increased numbers of ‘street salespeople’, who stop passersby and try to get them to commit to this monthly payment.A second reason for the increase could also be that there have been more charities started and the number of advertisements would therefore increase and become more noticeable. If these charities are all legitimate, this would mean that more help will be getting to causes that need it. The increase in charities could also be explained by a possible increase of humanitarian awareness. People might be now adopting different ideologies that take into account people in less advantageous positions.If the number of advertisements for charities has risen due to the fact that there has been a positive shift in people’s compassionate principles, this surely has to be seen as an optimistic development. If it is due to the fact that governments have been cutting back, it could be seen as a pessimistic development. In addition, if there are more charities asking for more money, this will inevitably mean that the amount of money donated will have to be more thinly spread, which would be a negative development.There could be several reasons for why there are more charity advertisements today. Whatever the reasons, as long as any money is helping people in disadvantageous positions, it must be seen as a positive development.;The charity sector has witnessed a significant transformation in recent years, with charities becoming increasingly aggressive in their marketing strategies. One of the primary reasons for this shift is the surge in the number of charities being established. As more charitable organizations emerge, the competition for donations and attention intensifies, leading to a proliferation of advertisements. It is not uncommon to encounter charity appeals on social media, online advertisements, and even door-to-door solicitations. This increased visibility has sparked concerns about the tactics employed by charities to secure funding.The proliferation of charities can be attributed to a rise in humanitarian awareness, with more individuals and organizations recognizing the need to address pressing social and environmental issues. As global challenges such as poverty, climate change, and inequality gain prominence, people are becoming more empathetic and motivated to contribute to causes that aim to mitigate these problems. Consequently, the number of charities has grown, and with it, the number of advertisements seeking to capture the attention of potential donors.While the aggressive marketing tactics employed by some charities may be perceived as intrusive or overwhelming, it is essential to acknowledge the underlying motivations driving these organizations. Charities are compelled to be more proactive in their fundraising efforts to stay afloat and make a meaningful impact. Moreover, the increased visibility of charitable causes can also be seen as a positive development, as it raises awareness about important issues and encourages people to engage with social and environmental problems. Ultimately, the key to navigating this new charity landscape lies in striking a balance between effective marketing and respecting the boundaries of potential donors. By doing so, charities can continue to raise essential funds while maintaining the trust and goodwill of their supporters.
466;The picture below shows how a hot balloon works. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features.You should write at least 150 words.;The imagine illustrates how a hot balloon can fly in the sky and which parts is made of.In brief, a hot ballon is composed by a basket, burner where a flame is produced to heat cool air and an envelope connected to it by a skirt and ropes. Hot air is made in order to allow the hot ballon to work.Firstly, the basket welcomes people aboard. Meanwhile, ropes allow to connect the basket to the skirt and the envelope, which is composed by few panels in a vertical lane, multiple gores and a parachute valve. This one is a self-sealing flap that allows hot air to escape a controlled rate.Secondly, Between the skirt and the basket is located a burner which is crucial for the use of the hot balloon. In fact, it has got a propane cylinder that mix this gas with cool air so that ignites a flame to heat the air inside of the envelope. As a result hot air is made, which is lighter than cool air, and allows the hot ballon to fly in the sky.;The Hot Air Balloon: A Marvel of EngineeringA hot air balloon is a fascinating mode of transportation that has been around for centuries. At its core, a hot air balloon is composed of three main components: a basket, a burner, and an envelope. The basket is the compartment where passengers and crew sit, providing a safe and secure environment during flight. The burner is a critical component, responsible for producing a flame that heats cool air, thereby creating hot air. This hot air is essential for the balloon to function, as it is the principle behind its buoyancy.The envelope, often made of lightweight and durable materials, is connected to the basket by ropes. As the burner produces a flame, it heats the cool air inside the envelope,, making it expand and become less dense than the surrounding air. According to the principle of buoyancy, as the hot air rises, it creates an upward force that lifts the balloon, basket, and its occupants into the air. The ropes connecting the envelope to the basket ensure that the two components remain securely attached, allowing for stable and controlled flight.The process of creating hot air is what allows the hot air balloon to work. As the air inside the envelope is heated, it expands and becomes lighter, causing the balloon to rise. Conversely, when the air is allowed to cool, the balloon descends. This basic principle is the foundation of hot air balloon flight, enabling these majestic crafts to soar through the skies, providing breathtaking views and an unforgettable experience for those on board. The combination of the basket, burner, and envelope, working in harmony to produce hot air, makes the hot air balloon an incredible feat of engineering and a testament to human innovation.
170;The picture below shows the plan of a museum in 1998 and after some changes were made in it in 2008. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The picture illustrates different areas of a museum in 1998 and alterations made in 2008.The museum consists of a garden located in the heart of the plan, with exhibition rooms, tickets entrance, shop, toilet, cafe, and bags and coats surrounded by.Take a look of the plan, in 1998, most of the areas in museum were permanent exhibition rooms and a garden in the center of it, however in 2008 exhibition rooms originally on the left side had been replaced with restaurant, temporary exhibition room, bags and coats, and finally the shop.Although garden maintains the same but be added with cafe sitting area and 2 fountains and parts of the area of cafe was distributed to WC after alterations in 2008.Currently, all of the permanent exhibition rooms are on the right side of the museum while others are on the left. Bags and coats , temporary exhibition room occupy a larger area than before the renovation of the museum.;The museum, as it stood in 1998, was a traditional institution with a focus on showcasing its permanent collections. The layout of the museum reflected this emphasis, with most of the areas dedicated to permanent exhibition rooms. A notable feature of the museum at that time was the beautiful garden situated at its center, providing a serene and peaceful oasis for visitors to enjoy. This design highlighted the museum's commitment to preserving and displaying its permanent collections in a tranquil and contemplative environment.However, by 2008, significant changes had been made to the museum's layout, indicating a shift in its operational and strategic approach. One of the most notable changes was the transformation of the exhibition rooms that were originally located on the left side of the museum. These spaces, which were once dedicated to showcasing parts of the museum's permanent or rotating collections, had been repurposed. In their place, a restaurant was introduced, offering visitors a space to dine and take a break from their museum tour. Additionally, a temporary exhibition room was also added, allowing the museum to feature special exhibitions and collections that might not be part of its permanent display. This change underscored the museum's new focus on providing a more dynamic and varied experience for its visitors.Furthermore, the left side of the museum now also housed facilities for storing bags and coats, as well as a shop. The inclusion of these amenities suggested an effort to enhance visitor convenience and provide opportunities for commercial activity, potentially as a way to support the museum's operations and programming. The shop, in particular, would offer visitors the chance to take home memorabilia or items related to the museum's collections, further extending the museum experience beyond the visit itself. Overall, the changes made to the museum by 2008 reflect a broader strategy to make the institution more engaging, convenient, and potentially self-sustaining, while still maintaining its core mission of preserving and showcasing art and history.
650;The pictures show the changes of a park from 1980 to the present day.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The picture illustrates the differences in a park between 1980 and the present. Information is indicated in year 1980 and present, specific locations inside the park and features such as trees, flowers, grass and entertainment facilities.Overall, there have been significant changes in the park from 1980 up to now especially the roads, the flowers, leisure facilities and the south entrance of the park.To begin with, in 1980 the south-west part of the park had four benches but now only three benches are left as a sitting area. Furthermore, in 1980 the park had only white flowers but now has greens grass and blue flowers. In addition, a football area was added in the south-east part of the park with blue flowers on the bottom. In contrast, the number of trees in the north-east part remained the same but now the three trees have different colour and a socializing was added next to the trees. Last but not least, in 1980 the park had only one main road with a blocked south entrance, whereas now the park consists of four small areas and four roads to separate the green areas.;The picture provided offers a striking contrast between the state of a park in 1980 and its current condition. Upon examining the image, it becomes apparent that significant transformations have taken place over the years, highlighting the evolution of the park's landscape and facilities.In 1980, the park appeared to be less developed, with fewer amenities and a more natural, untouched environment. The playground area, for instance, had only basic equipment such as swings and a slide, while the walking trails were unpaved and less defined. Additionally, the picnic area had limited seating and no shelters, making it less accommodating for visitors. The lake within the park was also less accessible, with no walking path or benches around it, limiting its usability for park-goers.In stark contrast, the present-day park is a testament to progress and development. The playground now boasts a variety of modern equipment, including climbing frames, interactive games, and safety flooring, making it a vibrant and safe space for children. The walking trails have been paved and are well-lit, allowing for safer and more accessible walks, even in the evenings. The picnic area has been expanded, with more seating, shelters, and BBQ facilities, making it an ideal spot for family gatherings and outdoor celebrations. The lake area has also undergone significant changes, with a walking path, a fountain, and benches, making it a serene spot for relaxation and leisure activities.Overall, the comparison between the park in 1980 and its current state reveals substantial improvements and expansions. These changes not only enhance the aesthetic appeal of the park but also increase its functionality, making it a more enjoyable and accessible space for a wider range of activities and visitors. The transformation of the park over the years is a clear indication of the community's effort to create a more welcoming and engaging public space, reflecting a broader trend towards valuing and investing in outdoor recreational areas.
654;The pie chart gives information on UAE government spending in 2000. The total budget was AED 315 billion.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The pie chart provides data about UAE regime expenditures in ten different sectors namely:law&order,Education,Industry agriculture &employment,Defence,other expenditure,Debt interest,housing the heritage& environment,Social security,Transport,and health&personal social services.while the total budget was AED315 billion for year 2000.In general, the visual indicates that most money went for social security,in contrast to transport that costs least expense on the UAE government from the total budget.To start with,the UAE government provided AED 315 billion as total budget for year 2000. The lion shear was for social security to record the highest value of expenses at AED 100 billion on the UAE government,followed by health and personal social services that AED 53 billion was spent by UAE authorities.Meanwhile, education costs was AED 38 billion from the total budget of year 2000.Interestingly,UAE government spent on other expenditure and debt interest only AED 23 billion for each from 2000's total budget.Later, defence ,Law and order,and housing the heritage and environment AED22 billion,AED17 billion,and AED 15 billion went for each respectively.Finally, the two least value was AED 13 billion,and AED 9 billion from the total budget to be paid for Industry agriculture &employment ,and transport accordingly.;The provided pie chart offers a comprehensive breakdown of the UAE regime's expenditures across ten distinct sectors. At a glance, it is evident that the government's allocation of funds varies significantly from one sector to another. Upon closer examination, it becomes clear that the majority of the expenditures are dedicated to Social Security, indicating the government's priority on ensuring the welfare and stability of its citizens.On the opposite end of the spectrum, the sector that incurs the least expense for the UAE government is Transport. This disparity highlights the government's strategic allocation of resources, focusing on the well-being and protection of its population over infrastructure development in this context. The chart also reveals expenditures in other sectors such as Law & Order, Education, Industry Agriculture & Employment, Defence, Other Expenditure, Debt Interest, Housing the Heritage & Environment, and Health & Personal Social Services, though these are less prominent than Social Security.The emphasis on Social Security suggests that the UAE regime prioritizes the financial and social stability of its citizens, possibly as a measure to maintain social harmony and economic growth. This allocation could also be a response to the needs of a rapidly growing population and the challenges associated with a developing economy. The relatively low expenditure on Transport, however, does not necessarily imply neglect but could indicate efficient existing infrastructure or a strategy to manage transport needs through private investments or public-private partnerships.In conclusion, the pie chart presents a nuanced view of the UAE's financial priorities, with a clear focus on Social Security as the cornerstone of its expenditures. This strategic allocation underscores the government's commitment to its citizens' welfare, reflecting a broader vision for societal stability and economic prosperity. The data invites further exploration into the rationale behind these financial decisions and their impacts on the country's development and its people's quality of life.
1278;The pie charts below give data on the spending and consumption of resources by countries of the world and how the population is distributed.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;Following three pie chats depict the distribution of population globally compared to spending and consumption of resources by countries .Overall , we can obseve in the first figure that world spends more in food and transport .Whilst in second chart summerize population in the world with Asia has bigger share .However third figure notes that USA and Europe consume main resources of the world .By analysing following data , its evident that food have the bigger share of spending money including 24% of total spending . Whilst transport comes next including 18% , housing and cloths consume 12% and 6% respectively . Nevertheless other aspects of life consume 40% . Meanwhile second pie chart about world population . Although, Asia froms 57% of population , highest percentage , Europe and America form 28% distributed equally and Africa 10 % . Interestingly USA and Europe consume 60% of world resources and rest of the world consumes 40% . Clearly that USA and Europe constitue 28% of world population but they consume the main resources of the world.;The three pie charts provided offer a fascinating glimpse into the global distribution of population, spending, and consumption of resources. At first glance, it is striking to note the disparities that exist between these three critical aspects of global economics and demographics.The first pie chart, which illustrates the distribution of global spending, reveals a notable trend: a significant portion of the world's expenditure is allocated to food and transport. This is not entirely surprising, given that these are fundamental necessities for human survival and economic activity. The fact that food and transport dominate the spending chart underscores the universal importance of these sectors across different economies and societies. It suggests that regardless of geographical location or economic status, individuals and nations prioritize spending on sustenance and mobility.However, when considering the global distribution of population in comparison, the contrast is stark. The majority of the world's population resides in regions that do not necessarily correlate with high spending patterns, especially in the food and transport sectors. This discrepancy highlights the complex relationship between population size, economic activity, and resource consumption. It implies that while some of the most populous countries may not be the largest spenders, their sheer population size demands significant resource allocation, potentially straining global resources.The comparison of population distribution with spending and consumption patterns of resources among countries offers valuable insights into global economic dynamics. It points to the need for sustainable and equitable resource management practices, ensuring that the needs of the global population are met without compromising the planet's ability to support future generations. Ultimately, understanding these distributions is crucial for policymakers and economists aiming to balance economic growth with environmental and social responsibility. By examining these pie charts, we are reminded of the intricate balance between consumption, spending, and population, underscoring the importance of thoughtful global resource management.
546;The pie charts below show how dangerous waste products are dealt with in three countries.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;"The pie charts illustrate the dealing with dangerous waste products in the Republic of Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. It can be clearly seen that the last country is the only one where people do not use the recycling method; instead, they prefer chemical treatment and dumping at sea.According to the data, the underground method (82%) coloured in red in the United Kingdom pie chart prevails, compared to Sweden (55%) and the Republic of Korea (22%), coloured in green. On the other hand, people in the Republic of Korea prefer to use the recycling method 69%) the most, while those who live in Sweden do not use it so often (25%).The United Kingdom has identical points at 8% for chemical treatment and dumping at sea methods. However, the lowest point (2%) has the incineration method in this country, while people in the Republic of Korea and Sweden destroy waste by fire more often, 9% and 20%, respectively.";The disposal of hazardous waste is a critical issue that affects the environment and public health in many countries. The pie charts provided offer a glimpse into the strategies employed by the Republic of Korea, Sweden, and the United Kingdom to manage their dangerous waste products. A comparative analysis of these charts reveals significant differences in the approaches adopted by these nations.In the Republic of Korea and Sweden, recycling is a predominant method for dealing with hazardous waste. This approach not only reduces the amount of waste that ends up in landfills but also helps conserve natural resources and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. The emphasis on recycling in these countries underscores their commitment to sustainable waste management practices and environmental protection.In stark contrast, the United Kingdom stands out as the only country among the three where recycling is not a preferred method for handling dangerous waste. Instead, the UK relies heavily on chemical treatment and dumping at sea. This approach is alarming, given the potential environmental and health risks associated with such practices. Chemical treatment may not always neutralize the harmful effects of hazardous waste, and dumping at sea can lead to marine pollution, affecting aquatic life and the ecosystem as a whole.The differences in waste management strategies among these countries highlight the need for a global consensus on best practices for dealing with hazardous waste. The Republic of Korea and Sweden's focus on recycling sets a positive example that other nations, including the United Kingdom, could learn from. Adopting sustainable waste management practices is crucial for mitigating the environmental impacts of hazardous waste and ensuring a healthier planet for future generations. Therefore, it is imperative for countries to reassess their waste disposal methods and strive towards more environmentally friendly and sustainable solutions.
596;The pie charts below show the average household expenditures in a country in 1950 and 2010.;The provided pie chart illustrates information about the spending rates in homes on different type of serevices in 6 dacades from 1950 to 2010.Overall,as it can be clearly seen that the housing expenditures rates is the highest in 1950 where,the health care rates was the least in that particular year.Where as in the 2010 the most expenditure was on food and the least expenditures was the transportation.As persented in the pie chart,the the majority of the people spend most of their money on housing with aprroximately 72.1percent that number dramaticly decreaced in 2010 to 22.0 percent .In contrast with the food sector where it started with only 11,2 percent in 1950 and rose up by almost 20% reaching to its peak od 34.0% in 2010.In terms, of other sectors including health care and education. the propotion of spending in the health care sector was relaetivly smaller with only 2.4 percent that number was doubled to 4.5.% in 2010.although there was no noticable changes in the education sector.Finally,the most significant change was definitely in transportation since people back in the 1950s where not interested in buying cars the percentage was as little as 3.3 percent that number dramaticky rose up to 14.0% in 2010.while their was obvious changes in other serevices the spending rates grow from 4.4% in 1950 to remarkable jump to 19.2 percent in the year 2010.;The provided pie chart offers a comprehensive overview of the spending rates in homes on different types of services over a span of six decades, from 1950 to 2010. A thorough analysis of the chart reveals significant shifts in expenditure patterns across these years, reflecting changing priorities and economic conditions.In 1950, the chart shows that housing expenditures had the highest rate, indicating that a substantial portion of household income was dedicated to housing costs. This is understandable given the post-war era's focus on rebuilding and expanding housing to meet the needs of a growing population. Conversely, healthcare expenditures were at their lowest in 1950, suggesting that either healthcare costs were less of a concern or that there were fewer healthcare services available at the time.Fast-forwarding to 2010, the chart paints a different picture. The most significant expenditure in this year was on food, highlighting the increased importance of nutrition and possibly reflecting higher food prices or a greater variety of food options available to consumers. On the other end of the spectrum, transportation expenditures were the least, which could be attributed to several factors, including improved public transportation, changes in work patterns such as telecommuting, or perhaps a shift towards more fuel-efficient vehicles.These observations underscore the dynamic nature of household spending over the decades, influenced by technological advancements, economic fluctuations, and societal priorities. The shift from housing being the primary expenditure in 1950 to food taking the lead in 2010, with healthcare's position changing significantly over the years, illustrates how household budget allocations adapt to the prevailing economic and social conditions. This analysis of spending patterns over time provides valuable insights into the evolving needs and priorities of households, emphasizing the importance of understanding these trends for policymakers and economists alike.
678;The pie charts below show the percentage of housing owned and rented in the UK in 1991 and 2007.Summarize the information by describing the main features of the charts and making comparisons where appropriate.;The diagrams illustrate the proportions of four different kinds of housing in the UK between 1991 and 2007, namely home owner, social renting, private renting as well as social housing.Overall, it is clear that the number of homes in UK recorded a considerable increase from 1991 to 2007, at 22 million homes compared to 27 million homes. Furthermore, more UK residents owened their home while less people chose social renting and social housing during the period from 1991 to 2007.Looking into the details, ,home owner is the top choice for UK residents which comprised 60% in 1991. Then, it considerably rose to 70% after 16 years. Next came to the social renting which recorded an dramatic decrease from 1991 to 2007, at 23% and 17% in turn. The percentage of social housing also significantly plunged from 6% to 2%. The percentage of private renting remain unchanged at 11% over the period.;The diagrams provided offer a comprehensive insight into the shifting landscape of housing in the UK between 1991 and 2007. One of the most striking trends that emerges from these illustrations is the significant increase in the total number of homes in the UK over this period. By 2007, the total number of homes had risen to 22 million, indicating a substantial expansion in the country's housing stock.A closer examination of the diagrams reveals notable shifts in the preferences and demographics of housing choices among the population. Perhaps the most pronounced trend is the increase in the number of people opting for home ownership. This uptrend suggests that during this period, more individuals and families aspired to and achieved ownership of their homes, reflecting broader societal and economic changes that made home ownership more accessible and desirable.Conversely, the diagrams show a decline in the proportion of the population choosing social renting and social housing. This decrease could be attributed to various factors, including changes in housing policies, economic conditions, and the availability of alternative housing options. The reduction in social housing uptake may also indicate a shift towards more private sector involvement in housing, with potential implications for housing affordability and accessibility for lower-income segments of the population.The shift towards home ownership and away from social renting and housing has significant implications for housing policy, economic stability, and social welfare in the UK. Understanding these trends is crucial for policymakers seeking to address issues of housing affordability, availability, and the overall well-being of the population. The diagrams underscore the dynamic nature of housing preferences and provision in the UK, highlighting the need for adaptable and responsive housing policies that cater to the evolving needs and aspirations of the population.
24;The pie charts below show the percentage of time working adults spent on different activities in a particular country in 1958 and 2008. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevantYou should write at least 150 words.;The pie charts indicate how the proportion of time changes in spending on different activities from working adults in a country in the years 1958 and 2008.Overall, while it can be seen that working was the most important event occupied a majority of the percentage of time either 1958 or 2008, the amount of time on sleeping decreased obviously in 2008.First, most of the researched events occupied more time than in the past. Working is one of the events presenting the most serious situation and it took 33% in 1958, increasing to 42% in 2008. Moreover, adult workers in this country were more likely to travel to work, presenting 8% in 2008 from only 2% in 1958. Besides working, citizens tended to relax at home spending 13% of the time on this event, and in which people take 8% of their time in 1958.However, the harder working, the less time was spent in rest. Working adults spent 25% of sleep in 2008, while they spent 32% in 1958. Also, they reduce the time spending in going out with their friends or families, spending only 6% in 1958 from 19% in 1958.;The pie charts provided offer a fascinating insight into the changing spending habits of working adults in a country over a period of five decades, from 1958 to 2008. One of the most striking observations from these charts is the significant shift in the proportion of time allocated to different activities, particularly highlighting the trade-off between work and rest.It is evident that as the workforce became harder working, the less time was spent on resting and leisure activities. This is quantitatively reflected in the reduction of sleep time from 32% in 1958 to 25% in 2008. This 7% decrease in sleep allocation over the years suggests a substantial change in lifestyle, where work seems to have taken precedence over personal downtime. The implications of this trend could be far-reaching, potentially affecting not only the physical and mental health of the workforce but also their productivity and overall quality of life.Besides the dedicated time to work and sleep, the charts also indicate that citizens tended to spend a considerable amount of time relaxing at home. With 13% of their time allocated to this activity, it suggests that even in their leisure time, working adults prefer the comfort and familiarity of their homes as a primary setting for relaxation. This preference could be attributed to the increasing demands of work life, leading to a desire for low-key, personal space where individuals can unwind without additional external pressures.In conclusion, the pie charts paint a picture of a society where work ethic has intensified over the years, leading to a compromise on rest and possibly affecting the work-life balance. The data underscores the need for a balanced approach to life, where work, rest, and leisure are allocated appropriate time to ensure the well-being and productivity of the workforce. As societal demands and work cultures continue to evolve, it will be interesting to observe how these proportions change in the future, reflecting shifts in values and priorities of the working adult population.
744;The pie graphs show the nutritional consistency of two dinners. Write a report to a university lecturer describing the data.You should write at least 150 words.;The pie charts illustrate the percentage of different types of nutrients (carbohydrates, protein, glucose, saturated fat and others) presented in a medium baked potato and in a macaroni.Overall, it can be observed that carbohydrates have the highest proportion in both types of dinner. In addition, saturated fat has the lowest percentage in medium baked potato, while it is the nutrient with the second higher quantity in macaroni.Looking at the amount of carbohydrates, it is possible to see that medium baked potato has 35%, while in macaroni it can be found at 52%. In a medium baked potato the amount of protein is more than a double than in a macaroni, at 25% and 11% respectively. In addition, glucose has a slight difference, at 15% in the potato and 11% in macaroni.Regarding saturated fat, only one out of ten is presented in the potato, although this number is much high in macaroni, at 21%. Finally, considering other types of nutrients, its varies considerably, at 15% in the potato and only 5% in the macaroni.;The composition of dinner plates can vary greatly, but two common components are carbohydrates and proteins. In both medium baked potatoes and macaroni, carbohydrates make up the highest proportion of nutrients. This is not surprising, given that both potatoes and macaroni are rich in complex carbohydrates.However, there is a significant difference in the protein content of these two dinner options. A medium baked potato contains a substantial amount of protein, making up 25% of its nutritional content. This is more than double the amount found in macaroni. This disparity highlights the potato as a more suitable option for those seeking to increase their protein intake.On the other hand, glucose levels in both dinner options are relatively similar. A medium baked potato contains 15% glucose, while macaroni contains 11%. This slight difference suggests that both options can be relatively low in glucose, making them suitable for those monitoring their sugar intake.In conclusion, while both medium baked potatoes and macaroni are rich in carbohydrates, there are notable differences in their protein and glucose content. The potato stands out as a higher protein option, with 25% of its nutritional content consisting of protein. Meanwhile, the glucose levels in both options are relatively low and similar, with only a 4% difference between them. Ultimately, the choice between a medium baked potato and macaroni for dinner depends on individual nutritional needs and preferences. By understanding the nutritional composition of these dinner options, individuals can make informed decisions to support their health and wellbeing.
152;The plans below show a student accommodation buildings 2010 and now.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant;The maps illustrate the changes of an architecture which was used for students’ accommodation in the year 2010 and now.In 2010, apparently, there was one main entrance in the southwest corner of the building where students could easily access. The livingroom was situated on the north side of the architecture where students could have a rest. Opposite to the livingroom, there was a bath room on the centre of the floor where students could use to take a shower. A kitchen was established be adjacent to the bathroom in the east side of the plan where children could cook by themselves. It is noticeable that there are three student-bedrooms laying on the southeast, northeast and northwest corners of the building respectively. Besides, the architecture was surrounded by gardens in the north and south sides.Now, after the modifications, an extra en-suits room has been added in the southeast corner be in the adjoining place of one of the student-bedrooms, taking the place of the hallway in 2010. It is worth noticing that the kitchen is also be used as a social area now. More striking is that the livingroom has been reconstructed into a student-bedroom. It must be pointed out that the building has been expanded and a new student-bedroom has been situated on the northwest corner of the architecture. In addition, the garden which was located on the south side of the construction has been modified into a car parking where individuals can park their cars.In conclusion, now the number of student-bedrooms has increased and the function of the student accommodation building has become manifold;The provided maps offer a fascinating insight into the transformations undergone by a student accommodation building, specifically highlighting the changes between its original state in 2010 and its current form. A notable difference in the building's layout is the modification of access points. Originally, in 2010, the building featured a single main entrance situated in the southwest corner, facilitating easy access for students. However, after the renovations, the building's accessibility and internal layout have undergone significant alterations.One of the most striking changes is the addition of an extra en-suite room, strategically located in the southeast corner of the building. This new addition is particularly noteworthy as it has been incorporated into the existing structure by being adjoined to one of the student bedrooms. This modification suggests an effort to increase the building's capacity and improve the living conditions for its residents. The incorporation of additional facilities such as en-suite rooms can greatly enhance the comfort and privacy of the students, potentially boosting their overall quality of life within the accommodation.Another significant alteration is the conversion of the living room into a student bedroom. This change indicates a shift in priorities, possibly reflecting a need for more personal living spaces for the students. The conversion of communal areas into private bedrooms may suggest an increasing demand for individual accommodation, potentially highlighting a preference among students for more independent living arrangements. This transformation not only alters the physical landscape of the building but also impacts the social dynamics among the residents, as communal spaces play a crucial role in fostering community and interaction.In conclusion, the maps clearly illustrate the significant changes made to the student accommodation building from 2010 to the present day. These modifications, including the addition of an en-suite room and the conversion of the living room into a bedroom, underscore efforts to enhance student living experiences. Such changes reflect evolving needs and preferences among students, emphasizing the importance of adaptability in student accommodation design.
998;The plans below show a student room for two people and a student room for one person at an Australian university.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The layout illustrates the structure of student rooms for one and two people respectively in an university in Australia.Overall, It can be obeserved that cost for one person in a double occupancy room is lower than expense in single room. the plan compares the amenities in both the rooms.Firstly the cost of one person is dollar 175/week in double room as compare to dollar 200 in single occupancy. The double occupancy room seems more cost effective and euipped with shared amenities.There is an evident difference in the size and facilities in both the room. The remarkable differences is table and chair.which are missing in the single room. Double occuapncy room comes additional cupboard and bookshelf as well. The width of the room is 4 meters and bigger as compare to single room which is 2.5 meters in dimesnions. Kitchen facilities are mostly similar in both the rooms.;"The layout of student rooms at a university in Australia reveals a notable distinction in the structure and facilities provided for single and double occupancy. The rooms are designed to cater to the diverse needs of students, offering a choice between single and double rooms. A single room, designed for one person, comes with a higher price tag of $200 per week. In contrast, a double room, which accommodates two people, costs $175 per week for each occupant. This significant price difference is not merely a matter of cost; it also reflects the variation in the size and facilities of the two types of rooms.The single room, being designed for solo occupancy, is naturally more spacious and better equipped to meet the individual needs of a student. It typically includes a larger study area, a more extensive storage space, and possibly even a private bathroom. The enhanced privacy and comfort are clearly reflected in the higher weekly cost.On the other hand, the double room, though slightly more compact, is designed to foster a sense of community and camaraderie among roommates. Despite being smaller, it still offers all the necessary amenities, including a shared study space and storage facilities. The cost-effectiveness of a double room, at $175 per week, makes it an attractive option for students who are on a tighter budget or prefer the social aspect of sharing a room.In conclusion, the layout of student rooms at this Australian university underscores the trade-offs between cost, space, and social interaction. While single rooms offer more privacy and comfort at a premium, double rooms provide a more affordable and socially engaging living experience. Ultimately, the choice between these options depends on individual priorities and preferences, making the university's accommodation offerings inclusive and adaptable to a diverse student body."
560;The process below shows how to make dough for a pizza.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;In the diagram, the steps needed to obtain a dough for a pizza are shown, figures are given for grams and time required for the process.In the initial stage, the staple ingredients, namely, 4 coup of 00 flour, 325 gr of water ( roughly one and a half cups) and a half teaspoon of dry active yeast respectively, are blended together in a cup.After being placed in a stand mixer, the primordial dough undergo through 3 mixing stages, with the first and the third at slow speed for 2 minutes each, and the second at medium speed for 5 minutes.Subsequently, the dough is going to be left to rest as long as its thickness has increased twofold, which it would takes at least 2 Hours.Having gotten rid of the bubbles by squeezing them manually, the resulting portion of dough is either divided thoroughly into 3 slices equally sized or making each of the three parts weigh 275 grams.;"The Art of Creating the Perfect Pizza DoughThe process of creating a delicious pizza begins with the preparation of the dough, a crucial component that provides the foundation for a variety of toppings. As illustrated in the diagram, the steps to obtain a perfect pizza dough are straightforward yet require precision. The initial stage is where the magic begins, as the staple ingredients are combined in a specific ratio to initiate the fermentation process.To start, 400 grams of ""00"" flour, 325 grams of water, and a half teaspoon of dry active yeast are blended together in a cup. The ""00"" flour, known for its fine texture and low protein content, is ideal for creating a crispy crust while maintaining a soft interior. The dry active yeast, a microorganism that consumes sugars and produces carbon dioxide, is the catalyst for the dough's rise. The precise measurement of these ingredients is vital, as it directly affects the final texture and flavor of the crust.As these ingredients are mixed, the yeast begins to activate, starting the fermentation process. This initial blending is a critical step, as it sets the stage for the dough's development. The combination of flour, water, and yeast creates a complex network of gluten strands, which will eventually give the dough its elasticity and strength. The half teaspoon of yeast may seem like a small amount, but it is sufficient to ferment the sugars present in the flour, producing the carbon dioxide that will make the dough rise.The careful blending of these fundamental ingredients in the initial stage lays the groundwork for a successful pizza dough. The diagram outlines the subsequent steps that involve kneading, resting, and shaping the dough, each step contributing to the development of the perfect crust. By following these steps and using the specified ingredients, one can create a delicious and authentic pizza dough, ready to be topped with an array of ingredients to satisfy any culinary desire."
1372;The proportion of older people is increasing, what problems will this cause and what solutions can be suggested?;In many countries the proportion of older people is steadily increasing. What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.It is true that nowadays people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences to this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.As people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. In other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. A second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. Finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent vital healthcare, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of senior citizens.In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.This essay covers the task requirements, however some problems of aging population get only a brief mention. The linking of sentences in the second body paragraph is somewhat ‘mechanical’ and could have been improved. Information sequencing and organisation in paragraphs are done well. The range of vocabulary and the fluency of its use, as well as lack of errors are impressive. Overall, this is a good example of how to get Band 8 without writing a very long essay.;The world is witnessing a significant demographic shift, with the proportion of older people increasing steadily in many countries. This trend is expected to continue, posing considerable challenges for individuals and society as a whole. One of the primary problems caused by an ageing population is the strain on pension and healthcare systems. As the number of retirees grows, the burden on these systems will intensify, leading to increased financial pressures on governments and individuals.Additionally, an ageing population can result in a shrinking workforce, leading to labour shortages and reduced economic growth. This, in turn, can impact the quality of life for older individuals, as they may not have sufficient financial resources to support themselves. Furthermore, ageing populations can also lead to social isolation and loneliness among older adults, as they may experience a decline in social connections and support networks.To mitigate the impact of ageing populations, several measures can be taken. Firstly, governments can implement policies to encourage older adults to remain in the workforce, such as offering flexible working arrangements and training programs. This can help to reduce the burden on pension systems and maintain economic growth. Secondly, investing in healthcare and social care services can help to improve the quality of life for older adults, enabling them to live independently for longer. Finally, community-based initiatives can be established to promote social connections and support networks among older adults, reducing the risk of social isolation and loneliness.In conclusion, the increasing proportion of older people in many countries poses significant challenges for individuals and society. However, by implementing measures such as encouraging older adults to remain in the workforce, investing in healthcare and social care, and promoting social connections, the impact of ageing populations can be reduced. It is essential for governments, organizations, and individuals to work together to address these challenges and ensure that older adults can live fulfilling and dignified lives.
1242;The table below describes the number of employees and factories in England and Wales from 1851 to 1901.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The table below shows the total number of employees,including male and female employees, and factories in England and Wales throught out the 60 year period from 1851 to 1901.Overall, it can be clearly seen that the total numbers of people employed had decreased over the period, whereas the number of factories had increased and only went down in the last 20 years.The number of male employees had a significant drop in the first decade,losing more than half the number of employees in 1851 and gradually decline overtime.Additionally,Female employees had a major in incline in the second decade which is exactly 100 thousands employees and countinued to decrease like male employees.As a result, the total number of employees declined noticeably in the first 20 years and steadliy went down for the next 40 years.In contrary,the number of factories increased considerably,reaching 721 factories in 1881 then slowly went downward afterwards.;The table illustrating the total number of employees, including both male and female workers, and factories in England and Wales from 1851 to 1901, presents a fascinating insight into the industrial development of the region during this 60-year period. Over these six decades, England and Wales underwent significant industrialization, transforming from predominantly agricultural societies to hubs of manufacturing and industrial activity.According to the table, there is a notable increase in the number of factories and employees across England and Wales. This trend reflects the expansion of industrial activities, driven by technological innovations, investments in infrastructure, and the availability of natural resources. The growth in the number of male employees is consistent with the traditional masculine domination of the industrial workforce during this period. However, the table also highlights an increase in female employees, indicating a shift in societal norms and economic necessities that led to more women entering the industrial workforce.The period from 1851 to 1901 was marked by significant economic and social changes. The Industrial Revolution, which was already underway in the early  of the 19th century, continued to gain momentum. New industries emerged, and existing ones expanded, leading to an increased demand for labor. This demand, coupled with urbanization and changes in family structures, contributed to the growth in the number of employees in factories.The data also suggests that industrial growth was not uniform across the period. Certain years showed more rapid expansion than others, possibly reflecting broader economic trends such as booms and recessions, as well as the impact of legislative changes aimed at improving working conditions and reducing child labor. The Factory Acts, for example, which were enacted during this period, not only improved working conditions but also influenced the composition of the workforce by restricting child labor and promoting adult employment.In conclusion, the table provides valuable evidence of the industrial expansion in England and Wales from 1851 to 1901. It underscores the significant growth in industrial employment and the evolving role of women in the workforce. This period laid the groundwork for the modern industrial state, with its characteristic large-scale manufacturing, urban centers, and a diversified workforce. Understanding these trends is essential for grasping the complexities of industrial development and its social and economic implications.
292;The table below gives information about the population of New Zealand between 2011 and 2012.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and making comparisons where relevant.;The table details the number of people living in New Zealand changed from2011 to 2012 and divided those people into four age groups.Looking from an overall perspective, the number of all ages was increasing. However, the percentage change in those four devided age groups was not as same as the all ages, to the contrary, two of these groups just showed opposite trend.In terms of all ages, the number in 2012 was 4,460,000, compared to the number in 2011, the percentage change increased 0,6 , which was as same as the percentage change of the 40-64 age group. Besides, we can easily see that the change in 65+ group was the most significant one, with the figure in 2011 500,000, increased 400,000, approximately double in the following year.As for the two decending age groups, under 15 and 15-39, the percentage change were both -0,2 , although the specific numbers were different. The age under 15 amounted to 801,750, was merely declined 1,750 in 2012, at the same time, the number of 15-39 group was largely decreased, changed from 1,520,000 to 1.500,000 in 2012.;The population of New Zealand underwent a notable transformation between 2011 and 2012. According to the data, the total number of people residing in the country was approximately 4,460,000 in 2012. Compared to the preceding year, 2011, this figure represents a percentage increase of 0.6%. This growth indicates a steady, albeit modest, expansion of the population.To gain a deeper understanding of this demographic shift, it is insightful to examine the population distribution across different age groups. The population can be broadly categorized into four age groups, although specific numbers for each group, except for the 65+ category, are not provided. The most striking change occurred within the 65+ age group. In 2011, this demographic comprised about 500,000 individuals. By 2012, the number surged to approximately 900,000, marking an increase of about 400,000. This drastic rise signifies that the population of the 65+ age group nearly doubled in just one year, highlighting a significant aging trend within the New Zealand population.This substantial increase in the older adult population has implications for healthcare, social security, and pension systems. It suggests that New Zealand may need to adapt its policies and services to cater to the needs of an aging population, ensuring that adequate support and resources are available to meet the demands of this demographic shift.In conclusion, the demographic changes in New Zealand from 2011 to 2012, particularly the significant growth in the 65+ age group, underscore the need for careful planning and resource allocation to accommodate the needs of an aging population. This trend is likely to continue, influencing various aspects of societal and economic structures in the years to come.
1206;The table below gives information about the underground railway systems in six cities.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The given table provides dataset on subway systems in 6 different cities in 3 different cities in 3 distinctive continents. The figures are displayed in terms of inauguration date, the length of route, in kilometers, and number of passengers in millions.Overall, the table outlines that older systems also are longer in extension and have more passengers.London, Paris and Tokyo were opened before the first half of the twentieth century (1863, 1900 and 1927 respectively). The former has the longest route (394 km) and latter the shortest (155 km); on the other hand the Japanese city has almost three times more passengers than the English capital.The cities with younger systems, namely Washington DC, Kyoto and Los Angeles were all opened after 1970. The North American cities have respectively 126 km and 28 km; while the Asian city accounts for 11 km. The capital of the US has the highest number of passengers (144 million) and the Asian city, the shortest, 45 million.";The development of metro systems in major cities around the world has a rich history. Some of the oldest and most renowned systems were opened before the first half of the twentieth century. London, Paris, and Tokyo are prime examples, with opening dates of 1863, 1900, and 1927, respectively. These cities were pioneers in providing efficient and convenient transportation to their inhabitants.Among these, London's metro system stands out for having the longest route, spanning an impressive 394 kilometers. This extensive network has been serving the city for over a century and a half, making it one of the most well-established and widely used metro systems globally. On the other hand, Tokyo's system, which opened much later, has the shortest route, covering 155 kilometers. Despite its relatively shorter length, Tokyo's metro is known for its efficiency and punctuality, reflecting the city's reputation for precision and reliability.In contrast, cities with younger metro systems, such as Washington DC, Kyoto, and Los Angeles, were all opened after 1970. These newer systems have had the advantage of learning from the experiences and advancements of their predecessors, allowing them to incorporate modern technologies and designs. Despite being relatively younger, these systems have quickly become integral parts of their respective cities' transportation networks, offering convenient and rapid transit options to their populations.The evolution of metro systems in these cities underscores the importance of urban planning and transportation infrastructure in supporting the growth and development of metropolitan areas. From the historic systems of London and Paris to the more recent additions in Washington DC, Kyoto, and Los Angeles, each has played a significant role in shaping the urban landscape and enhancing the quality of life for residents and visitors alike.

In contrast, the population in Italy is foreseen to be lower in the future than in the previous data.First, there were 238 million in the population in Indonesia. it is not only that the number of Indonesian was the highest value in 2003, but also is predicted to have an obvious rise to 274 million in 2025 and 312 million in 2050. Regarding Argentina, the number of people in this country was recorded as 34 million in 2003 and has a bulge to be an almost double figure in 2050, presenting 62 million. the population in the Republic of Korea is forecasted to increase to 52 million in 2025 and remain stable until 2050, with 48 million recorded in 2003.However, Italy is the only country predicted to be declining in population in this table. there were 54 million Italian in 2003 and this will be decreasing to 47 million in 2025. The downtrend will be kept there will be 45 million Italian in 2050.;The world's population is expected to undergo significant changes in the coming decades, with various countries experiencing unique trends. Among the most notable examples is Indonesia, which currently boasts the largest population and is projected to continue growing in the future. This rapid expansion will undoubtedly pose significant challenges for the country, including providing adequate resources, infrastructure, and services for its increasing citizenry.In contrast, Argentina is anticipated to experience a substantial surge in its population, with projections indicating a near doubling of its numbers by 2050, reaching an impressive 62 million. This significant bulge will likely have far-reaching implications for the country's economy, social services, and environmental sustainability. As Argentina's population grows, it will be essential for the government to implement effective policies and strategies to manage this expansion and ensure that the needs of its citizens are met.Meanwhile, the Republic of Korea is forecasted to experience a more modest increase in its population, with numbers expected to reach 52 million by 2025. Notably, the country's population is projected to remain relatively stable until  least 2050, with minimal fluctuations anticipated. This stability will likely provide the Republic of Korea with a unique opportunity to focus on sustainable development, urban planning, and social welfare, without the pressures of rapid population growth. As the global population continues to evolve, it is crucial for countries like Indonesia, Argentina, and the Republic of Korea to prioritize careful planning, resource management, and social development to ensure a prosperous and sustainable future for their citizens.

1228;The table below shows social and economic indicators for four countries in 1994, according to United Nations statistics.Describe the information shown below in your own words. What implications do the indicators have for the countries?;The table compares the performance of social and economic aspects for Canada, Japan, Peru and Zaire in 1995. In general, Japan and Canada outperformed in four social and economic indicators their counterparts, Peru and Zaire.To be precise, regarding the economic indicators, people in Japan earned the highest annual income among the four countries, with US$ 15,760, and Canadian people earned the second most annual income with US$11,100. People in Peru and Zaire earned a lower annual income, almost 98 times less than people in Canada and Japan.With regard to the social indicators, people in Canada and Japan showed a longer life expectancy at birth, both of which had a life expectancy of more than 75 years old, whereas the life expectancy in Peru and Zaire was much lower, with only around 50 years old. The adult literacy rate in Canada and Japan saw the same percentage, both at 99%. While 68% of adults in Peru had literacy, the adult literacy rate in Zaire was only 34%, two times less than Peru and almost three times lower than Canada and Japan. With respect to the daily calorie supply, Canada had the highest calorie supply per person, with a number of 3326, while Japan, Peru, and Zaire received a lower calorie supply with aroud 2000 only.;The table provided offers a comparative analysis of the social and economic performance of four countries: Canada, Japan, Peru, and Zaire, with data from 1995. This comparison highlights significant disparities in life expectancy, literacy rates, and other social indicators among these nations.One of the most striking observations from the data is the life expectancy at birth for individuals in Canada and Japan. Both countries boasted an average life expectancy of more than 75 years, indicating a high standard of living and quality of healthcare. This suggests that these countries have made significant investments in their healthcare systems, leading to better outcomes for their citizens.Regarding social indicators, Japan and Canada again demonstrated superior performance, with both countries achieving a 99% rating. This high rating implies that both nations have successfully implemented policies and programs that promote social well-being, education, and possibly other factors that contribute to a high quality of life.In contrast, Peru and Zaire presented more challenging social and economic landscapes. While Peru's adult literacy rate was 68%, Zaire's was significantly lower at 34%. This disparity underscores the varying levels of investment in education and social development among these countries. The literacy rate is a critical indicator of a country's potential for economic growth and social progress, as it reflects the population's ability to participate in the economy and make informed decisions.The comparison of these countries in 1995 serves as a reminder of the wide gaps in development and quality of life that exist globally. It emphasizes the need for continued investment in healthcare, education, and social programs to improve life expectancy, literacy, and overall well-being. By examining the performance of Canada, Japan, Peru, and Zaire, it becomes clear that prioritizing these areas is crucial for fostering more equitable and prosperous societies.
344;The table below shows the consumption of three basic foods (wheat, maize, rice) by people in four different countries.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;THe given chart illustrates the comsuption of three basic foods(wheat, maize, rice) by people in four different countries which are Cambodia, Poland, Egypt and mexico. The measurement used per basic food is calories per person per day.If we analyse rice consumption first, we can observe that Cambodia leads the consumption rate, followed by far by Egypt, Mexico and Poland. However over wheat the country with highest consumption rate is Egypt closely followed by Poland. Regarding maize the country with a higher consumption rate is Mexico, followed by Egypt, nevertheless the maize consumption in Mexico almost doubles Egipt´s consumption.To summarise the consumption of rice in Cambodia is almost 300% over the rice consumption in Egypt, and very far away from the consumption in Mexico and Poland. The wheat consumption in Egypt is high, and is over a 30% beyond Poland´s consumption. To finalize the consumption of maize is high in Mexico being almost 100% over Egypt´s consumption.;The given chart provides a comprehensive overview of the consumption patterns of three basic food items, namely wheat, maize, and rice, in four distinct countries: Cambodia, Poland, Egypt, and Mexico. At first glance, it is evident that the consumption patterns of these staple foods vary significantly across these nations, reflecting the diverse culinary traditions and dietary preferences of each country.In Cambodia, rice is the predominant staple food, with the majority of the population relying heavily on it as a primary source of nutrition. This is not surprising, given the cultural significance of rice in Southeast Asian cuisine. Conversely, in Poland, wheat consumption takes the lead, which is consistent with the European dietary preference for bread and other wheat-based products.Egypt and Mexico exhibit different consumption patterns. In Egypt, wheat and rice are consumed in relatively equal proportions, while maize consumption is notably lower. This might be attributed to the historical influence of Mediterranean dietary habits, which emphasize grains like wheat and rice. Mexico, on the other hand, shows a higher consumption of maize, which aligns with the traditional dietary practices of the region, where maize (or corn) is a fundamental ingredient in many dishes.These differences in consumption not only underscore the diversity of global dietary habits but also highlight the role of cultural, historical, and geographical factors in shaping food preferences. Understanding these patterns can be crucial for agricultural planning, trade, and public health initiatives, as they help in predicting demand, managing resources, and promoting nutritional balance among populations. Ultimately, the chart serves as a vivid reminder of the complex interplay between food, culture, and geography, and its implications for both local and global food systems.
264;The table below shows the percentage of adults in urban and rural areas who took part in four free time activities in 1990 and 2010. Summarize the information and compare where relevant, by selecting and reporting the key features.You should write at least 150 words.;The chart illustrated the rate of adults in urban and rural areas, who participated in four free time activities at two time 1990 and 2010.First of all, we can see that reading and photography activities increased in 2010 in both territory and it was the favorite activity. The last thirds activities are less popular but knowned some small change.On one hand, 61% of people read in urban area in 1990 compare to 71% in rural and these percentages rose up to 78% for both areas in 2010. Photography knowned a similar change from 7% and 14% to reach a peak at 17% and 24%, in urban and rural areas respectively.On the other hand, percentage of animated play dropped out from 18% to 14% in countries and remain the same in urban areas. Conversely, playing went down in urban from 21% to 14% in 2010 and didn't change in rural areas with 26%.To conclude, reading stay away the favorite activity for people in each areas trought the years. People seemed to be more interested in photography. Animated play and playing remain the same with a little decreased in rural for animated and urban for playing.;The chart provided offers a fascinating insight into the leisure activities of adults in both urban and rural areas, highlighting the participation rates in four specific activities over two distinct time periods: 1990 and 2010. This comparative analysis reveals intriguing trends in how adults in these different settings choose to spend their free time.One of the most notable observations from the chart is the increase in participation rates for reading and photography activities in both urban and rural areas from 1990 to 2010. This uptrend suggests a growing interest in these pursuits among adults, regardless of their geographical location. The fact that these activities saw an increase in participation in both settings implies a broader cultural or societal shift towards valuing these hobbies.Furthermore, the data indicates that reading and photography became the favorite activities among adults in both urban and rural areas by 2010. This preference is significant as it reflects a shift towards more individualistic and possibly more intellectually or creatively stimulating activities. The appeal of reading and photography can be attributed to their ability to provide personal fulfillment, escape, and a means of creative expression, which seemingly resonated with a larger portion of the adult population by 2010.The increase in participation in these activities across different geographic locations also underscores the diminishing gap between urban and rural areas in terms of leisure activity preferences. This convergence could be due to various factors, including improved access to information, increased mobility, and the globalization of culture, which have made these activities more accessible and appealing to a broader audience.In conclusion, the chart paints a picture of evolving leisure activity preferences among adults in urban and rural settings, with reading and photography emerging as favored pursuits by 2010. This shift towards more personal and creative activities reflects broader societal changes and a blurring of the lines between urban and rural leisure cultures. As we move forward, it will be interesting to observe how these trends continue to evolve and what new activities might capture the attention of adults in the future.

948;The table below shows the results of surveys in 2000, 2005 and 2010 about one university.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The table shows the ratings given to different aspects of a university and how these differ from 2000, 2005 and 2010.In 2000 the teaching quality was considered good by sixty-five percent of the student, while in 2005 sixty-three percent of them rated good this aspect. However, in 2010 the percentage raised to sixty-nine.In 2000 eighty-four percent of the student found the print resources a valid service. The percent increases to eighty-nine in 2005 and decreases to eight-eight in 2010.With regard to electronic resources, a huge difference between years can be spotted: in 2000 the percentage of students with a good rating for this aspect was forty-four, while it was seventy-two in 2005 and eighty-eight in 2010. This change shows a big jump in the percentage of students that rated good this service.Regarding the range of modules offered the percentage remained stable throughout the year. in 2000 thirty-two percent of the students considered good this aspect. In 2005 only thirty percent of the people asked stated that the service was good. The number was twenty-seven in 2010.With regard to the last aspect the number remained the same for all years: seventy-seven percent of the students gave a high score to this aspect.;The table provides a comprehensive overview of the ratings given to various aspects of a university, with a specific focus on the teaching quality over the years 2000, 2005, and 2010. This essay aims to analyze the shifts in student perceptions of teaching quality during these years.In 2000, sixty-five percent of the students considered the teaching quality to be good, indicating a relatively positive initial perception. However, by 2005, there was a slight decline in this rating, with sixty-three percent of students rating the teaching quality as good. This decrease could be attributed to various factors such as changes in faculty, curriculum, or student expectations.Interestingly, the ratings took a positive turn by 2010, with sixty-nine percent of students considering the teaching quality to be good. This significant increase suggests that the university made substantial improvements in its teaching methods, faculty, or overall academic environment between 2005 and 2010. The uptick in ratings could be the result of the university's efforts to enhance its educational offerings, possibly through the adoption of new teaching technologies, hiring of more qualified instructors, or the implementation of student-centered learning approaches.The data highlights the importance of continuously assessing and improving teaching quality to meet the evolving needs and expectations of students. The university's ability to not only maintain but improve its teaching standards over the decade is commendable and reflects a commitment to educational excellence. As educational institutions strive to provide the best possible experience for their students, understanding and acting upon feedback such as that provided in the table is crucial for fostering academic environments that support student success and satisfaction.
892;The table below shows the salaries of secondary/high school teachers in 2009. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparison where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The table gives information about the salaries of secondary school teachers in different countries in 2009. The main differences between the countries are two. First, a discrepancy concerns the starting salary of teachers. Second, there is a gap in the years that teachers need to teach before obtaining the maximum salary.On the one hand, the starting salaries of teachers in the selected countries are slightly different. Luxemburg teachers reach the highest starting salary, equal to 80,000. Instead, in Australia, there are the least paid teachers, they have less than 30,000 per year. There is an enormous discrepancy between Luxemburg, in which the starting salaries are the highest ones, and the other countries. Although Denmark is the second country in giving higher salaries, the money teachers reach the first years of teaching is 45.000.On the other hand, another discrepancy concerns the years that a teacher has to teach before reaching the maximum salary. Indeed, despite being the least-paid teachers, Australians obtain the maximum salary after 9 years of teaching and obtain 48.000 per year. Instead, Luxemburg requires 30 years of work to give teachers the maximum salary, which is also the highest among the countries, and corresponds to 130.000. Denmark is the country in which high-school teachers obtain the maximum salary in just 8 years. On the completely opposite side, Japan teachers have to teach for at least 37 years before obtaining the highest salary.;The salaries of secondary school teachers vary significantly across different countries, as evident from the table provided for the year 2009. Upon analyzing the data, two primary discrepancies emerge, highlighting the diversity in compensation structures for educators worldwide.Firstly, a notable difference lies in the starting salaries of teachers. The table reveals a wide range of initial salaries, indicating that some countries prioritize attracting new teachers with higher pay, while others may offer lower starting points. This discrepancy suggests that the value placed on new educators and the cost of living in each country play significant roles in determining these salary benchmarks. For instance, countries with higher costs of living or more competitive job markets may need to offer higher starting salaries to attract qualified candidates. This variation underscores the different economic and educational priorities of each nation.Secondly, there is a significant gap in the number of years teachers need to work before reaching their maximum salary. The table shows that the duration to achieve the top salary varies substantially from one country to another. This difference reflects varying approaches to rewarding teacher experience and longevity. Some countries may prioritize rewarding longevity and experience with incremental salary increases, aiming to retain seasoned educators. In contrast, others may adopt a more rapid progression to maximum salary, potentially focusing on attracting and retaining talent through quicker financial growth opportunities. This disparity highlights fundamental differences in human resource management and the perceived value of teaching experience across these countries.In conclusion, the salaries of secondary school teachers in 2009, as indicated by the provided table, exhibit two main differences: the starting salary and the years required to reach the maximum salary. These discrepancies not only reflect economic and educational policy differences but also underscore the varied priorities and values placed on teaching as a profession across nations. Understanding these differences is crucial for developing policies that attract, retain, and reward educators effectively, ultimately impacting the quality of secondary education globally.
1212;The table below shows the sales at a small restaurant in a downtown business district.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The chart provides information on purchases at a mini restaurant in the week of october (7th -13th ).Overall, the sales were much more attributed to dinner consumption than lunch across all the days of the week , with a drop in sales by the weekend.There is an observable steady increase in lunch sales as we move across the week. Purchases worth $2400 was made on monday and a slight improvement on sales by $50 on tuesday and a further increase in sales to $2595 on Wednesday.There was however a dip in sales on thursday, with an immediate rebound increment on friday to exactly $2500.However, the sales dopped drastically to $1550 on Sunday.Regarding Dinner sales, we can see that a revenue of $3623 was realised on monday. Afterwards, the purchases became relatively stable at arround $3850 from tuesday to thursday and a further rise to $4350 on Friday. Similarly to lunch sales, there was also a drop by the weekend to about $2450.;The chart provides valuable insights into the purchasing habits of customers at a mini restaurant during the week of October 7th-13th. A closer examination of the data reveals that dinner consumption was the primary driver of sales throughout the week, with lunch sales playing a secondary role. This trend holds true across all days of the week, with dinner sales consistently outpacing lunch sales.A notable observation from the chart is the significant disparity between dinner and lunch sales. On weekdays, dinner sales are substantially higher, indicating that customers prefer to dine at the restaurant in the evening rather than during the day. This could be attributed to the fact that many people are at work or school during the day and prefer to eat out in the evening.However, it is also evident from the chart that sales experience a decline over the weekend. This drop in sales could be due to various factors, such as customers opting for other dining options or preferring to cook at home on weekends. Additionally, the weekend slump may also be attributed to the restaurant's target market, which may be predominantly office workers or students who are less likely to dine out on weekends.In conclusion, the chart highlights the importance of dinner sales at the mini restaurant, with a noticeable drop in sales over the weekend. To maximize profits, the restaurant may consider strategies to boost weekend sales, such as offering special promotions or discounts. Furthermore, the restaurant could also explore ways to increase lunch sales, such as introducing new menu items or improving the overall dining experience. By understanding and responding to these trends, the restaurant can optimize its operations and improve its overall performance.

Unlike Sandwiches which start at lowest number in the morning with 50 piece only .Nevertheless their sales increased dramatically afternoon to 200 and fall to 110 at the night .;The table illustrating the sales made by a coffee shop in an office building on an ideal weekday reveals interesting trends in consumer behavior. A thorough analysis of the data indicates that the coffee shop experiences peak sales of certain items during specific times of the day.Drinks such as tea and coffee are the top-selling items in the morning, suggesting that office workers rely on these beverages to start their day. This is not surprising, given the stimulating effects of caffeine and the comforting warmth of a hot cup of tea or coffee on a typical weekday morning. The high demand for these drinks during this time underscores the importance of the coffee shop as a morning pit stop for many office workers.Similarly, pastries are also highly sought after in the morning, with sales figures indicating a strong correlation between the sale of drinks and pastries during this time. This suggests that customers often pair their morning coffee or tea with a sweet or savory pastry, highlighting the coffee shop's role in providing a convenient and satisfying breakfast option.In contrast, the afternoon sees a shift in sales, with sandwiches emerging as the best-selling item. This could be attributed to the fact that office workers often take a break or grab a quick lunch during this time, opting for more substantial and filling food options like sandwiches. The higher sales of sandwiches in the afternoon demonstrate the coffee shop's ability to adapt to changing consumer needs throughout the day.Overall, the sales data from the coffee shop highlights the dynamic nature of consumer demand, with different items experiencing peak sales at different times of the day. By understanding these trends, the coffee shop can optimize its offerings and services to meet the evolving needs of its office worker clientele, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and driving sales.
1168;The table below shows the table made by a coffee shop in an office building on a typical weekday.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The given table presents the detailed amounts of four products that are daily sold in a coffee shop located in an office building. These products include coffee, tea, pastries, and sandwiches. As is shown by the table the data is categorized into four periods on a typical weekday from 7:30 until 20:30.From the first row of the given diagram, it is clear that pastries and coffee are the favorite products during the first three hours of the day, with 275 and 265 units, respectively.The next period has the sandwiches as the most common product between 10:30 and 14:30, while coffee maintain its position at the second place with 185 sales.Turning to the afternoon, during which pastries again retain the dominance with 150 sales in the hours 14:30- 17:30, and coffee occupies again the second place with 145.At the end of the day, this coffee shop sees, for the first time, that coffee is the most bought item at a specific period of the day with 200 cups of coffee served for the clients, while sandwiches this time come second with 110.Turning to tea, which is apparently the least popular product in this place during most of the time apart from the morning hours. The tea sales stand at 110, 50, 35, and 75 in this chronological order.Overall, coffee is the most stable item during the day, as it occupies the first or the second places over the whole period given in this table.;The given table provides a detailed breakdown of the daily sales of four key products at a coffee shop situated in an office building. These products comprise coffee, tea, pastries, and sandwiches, which are staples in many office workers' daily routines. The data is organized into four distinct periods on a typical weekday, spanning from 7:30 to 20:30. This categorization allows for a nuanced understanding of consumer preferences and purchasing patterns throughout the day.During the early morning period from 7:30 to 10:30, the coffee shop experiences a surge in sales of coffee and pastries, as office workers stop by for a quick breakfast before starting their day. The sales figures for these items are significantly higher during this period compared to the others, indicating a strong demand for these products among early risers.As the day progresses into the late morning period from 10:30 to 13:30, the sales of sandwiches and tea start to gain momentum. This shift in consumer preference suggests that office workers are seeking more substantial meals and alternative beverages as they take their lunch breaks.The late afternoon period from 13:30 to 17:30 sees a steady demand for all products, with a slight increase in coffee sales, possibly due to the post-lunch slump when workers need a caffeine boost to stay focused.Finally, during the early evening period from 17:30 to 20:30, there is a noticeable decline in sales across all products, as the office building empties and workers head home. Understanding these daily sales patterns can help the coffee shop optimize its inventory, staffing, and marketing strategies to better serve its clientele and maximize profits. By analyzing the peaks and troughs in demand, the coffee shop can tailor its offerings to meet the evolving needs of office workers throughout the day.
48;The table describes the changes of people who went for international travel in 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005. (million).Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The table compares the changes in the number of international travelers in different regions in the years of 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005.It is clear that the total number of international travelers increased in the given 15 year period. However, the increase was the most marked from 1990 to 1995.In the given statistics, Europeans are the ones who like to travel the most and the middle east is the place where least people went for trips internationally. While Africa and Asia and the Pacific experienced a similar increasing trend of travellers from 1995 to 2005.In America, people showed a great willingness to travel abroad between 1990 to 1995. But, then the number stayed more or less at the same level till 2005. Likewise, Europe also experienced a significant increase from 1990 to 2000 in travelling abroad. But, after 1995, there was an increase of around 10 million only.Overall, Europe contributed the most in overseas travel, whereas the Middle East had the least share of overseas travelers.;The table illustrates the shift in the number of international travelers across various regions from 1990 to 2005. A notable trend emerges, highlighting Europeans as the most avid travelers. In contrast, the Middle East stands out as the region that attracted the least number of international travelers during the same period.One of the most striking observations from the data is the consistent increase in international travel to Africa, Asia, and the Pacific from 1995 to 2005. These regions experienced a similar upward trend, indicating a growing interest in exploring these parts of the world. This could be attributed to the increasing accessibility of travel options, improved infrastructure, and the rising appeal of exotic destinations within these regions.On the other hand, the Middle East, despite its rich cultural and historical significance, saw the least number of international travelers. This could be due to various factors, including political instability, travel restrictions, or a lack of awareness about the region's tourist attractions.Europeans, as the data suggests, have a strong penchant for travel, with a significant number of international travelers originating from this region. This could be due to factors such as proximity to other countries, a strong economy facilitating travel, and a cultural inclination towards exploration.In conclusion, the statistics provided in the table offer valuable insights into global travel trends from 1990 to 2005. The increasing popularity of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific as travel destinations, coupled with the Middle East's relatively low attraction of international travelers, and Europeans' love for travel, paints a diverse picture of global travel preferences. These trends can inform tourism policies, travel marketing strategies, and infrastructure development to cater to the evolving interests and preferences of international travelers.
836;The table displays the average monthly rainfall for the year in five cities of the world.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The following table gives information on the average monthly rainfall in five cities. In the first row of the table, every month of the year is shown, from January to December. In the first column of the table, five cities are visible; Hongkong,Tokyo,Jakarta,Cairo, and London. The following cities are from very different parts of the world, this why there is great differences between the values. The city with the least rainfall was Cairo, hence there was not any rain from September to December, while Hongkong and Jakarta have had significantly more rain throughout the year. Hongkong peaked at 380mm of rain in August, and experienced the greatest fluctiation in monthly rainfall, with the biggest difference between January and August. In Tokyo, there is a steady increase in monthly rainfall from January to December, with only slight deviations. Jakrata seen the most rain in January, with an outstanding 300mm, which decreases until August, then starts increasing again until December. London is the most consistent out of the 5 cities, with the biggest difference between months being 25mm of rain.";The table provided offers a fascinating glimpse into the diverse rainfall patterns across five major cities from different parts of the world: Hong Kong, Tokyo, Jakarta, Cairo, and London. At a glance, it is evident that the average monthly rainfall in these cities varies significantly, reflecting the unique climatic conditions of each region.Hong Kong and Tokyo, both located in East Asia, exhibit a pronounced summer rainfall peak, characteristic of the monsoon climate that dominates this part of the world. In contrast, Jakarta, situated near the equator, displays a relatively consistent rainfall pattern throughout the year, typical of tropical regions where the rainfall is more evenly distributed across the months.On the other hand, Cairo, a city in the arid desert region of North Africa, shows a very low average monthly rainfall, highlighting its desert climate where precipitation is scarce and unpredictable. Lastly, London, representing a Western European city, has a more moderate and consistent rainfall pattern, with no distinct dry or wet seasons, which is typical of the temperate maritime climate.These differences underscore the vast range of climatic conditions found across the globe, influenced by factors such as latitude, altitude, and the presence of large bodies of water. The significant variations in rainfall patterns among these cities not only reflect their geographical locations but also have profound implications for urban planning, agriculture, and water resource management in each region.In conclusion, the table illustrates the remarkable diversity in average monthly rainfall among Hong Kong, Tokyo, Jakarta, Cairo, and London, a testament to the complex and varied nature of Earth's climate. Understanding these differences is crucial for addressing the unique environmental challenges and opportunities faced by each city, emphasizing the importance of considering local climatic conditions in development and sustainability efforts.
788;The table displays trends concerning the amounts of fast food consumed in Melbourne. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevantYou should write at least 150 words.;The table outlines the past, present, and future consumption of five types of fast food. Comparing the consumption in 2005 with the present level, it is clear that all consumptios of fast food has increased since 2005 except for the hamburger. While this trend suggests that hamburger consumption is in decline, projected consumption in 2025 shows that burgers would gain renewed interest.Moving the attention away from hamburgers, we can see that the increase in salad consumption is more drastic than that of other fast food categories. Specifically, the predicted increase in fried chicken consumption is 10 units, which is outshadowed by the 36-unit increase for salad. This suggests that, while more fast food will be consumed overall, the general public is shifting towards healthier options.Finally, although the consumption for hamburger, friedn chicken, and salad all increased significantly, figures for fried rice and noodles remained stagnant. This suggests that both fried rice and noodles are less welcomed by the consumers compared to other fast food.;The table provided offers a comprehensive overview of the consumption patterns of five types of fast food across three time periods: the past (2005), the present, and projected future consumption. Upon examining the data, a notable trend emerges when comparing the consumption levels of 2005 with the present day. It is evident that the consumption of all fast food types has increased since 2005, with one exception: the hamburger. This decrease in hamburger consumption suggests a shift in consumer preferences away from traditional fast food staples towards potentially healthier or more diverse options. Moving away from hamburgers, the data reveals that the increase in salad consumption is particularly striking, outpacing the growth in consumption of other fast food categories. This drastic increase in salad consumption can be interpreted as a positive trend, indicating that consumers are opting for healthier, more balanced meal options when choosing fast food.The shift towards salad consumption may be attributed to growing health consciousness among consumers, as well as an increased awareness of the importance of balanced diets. This trend is promising, as it suggests that the fast food industry is adapting to meet the evolving preferences and needs of its consumers, offering more nutritious options alongside traditional fare. As the fast food landscape continues to evolve, it will be interesting to observe how these trends develop in the future, and whether the industry can continue to meet the changing demands of a more health-conscious consumer base. Overall, the data paints a picture of a consumer market in transition, moving towards a future where fast food and healthy eating are not mutually exclusive concepts.
889;The tendency of news reports in the media to focus more on problems and emergencies rather than on positive developments is harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole.To what extent do you agree or disagree?;News reports in the media focus on problems and emergencies more often than on some positive events. Is it really harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole?Let us consider the purpose of the media existence first. I suppose it is to spread important information, so that people may use it in their lives. And problems are usually more important than some positive developments, since, in fact, they are the things which people should be aware of in the first place. For example, due to the COVID, which is an international problem, many people lost their jobs. If they had been notified about the rising of pandemic though, they would have prepared somehow (save more money by cutting unnecessary expenses, learn a new profession and so forth).Moreover, I believe problems shall be solved. And when people are concerned about some problems, they may tend to face them with honor and participate in solving them. For instance, the energy crisis is a huge problem, and it is important to aware society of it, so that individuals could try to be more careful with gas and electricity. In the end, society will benefit from it, so it is not harmful.On the other hand, there is some negative impact of bad news on individuals sometimes. But I am sure it should be considered as psychological issues of particular individuals, rather than a problem of today's media system. People just should not fall in despair because of news reports, but think how they could take an advantage of the provided information to minimize a negative impact and help humanity to solve problems.Finally, in my view, the stated tendency is not really harmful to society, but it may sometimes be harmful to the individuals, and they are responsible for it.;The media's tendency to prioritize problems and emergencies over positive events has become a staple of modern news reporting. While this approach may attract viewers and boost ratings, it raises important questions about the potential harm it may cause to individuals and society as a whole. On one hand, the constant barrage of negative news can have a profound impact on an individual's mental health and outlook. The relentless exposure to stories of violence, crime, and tragedy can create a sense of hopelessness and despair, leading to increased stress and anxiety levels.Moreover, the focus on problems and emergencies can also perpetuate a pessimistic view of the world, making individuals feel that the world is a more dangerous and unstable place than it actually is. This can have far-reaching consequences, including a decrease in civic engagement, social trust, and community cohesion. On the other hand, it is also argued that bad news can have some negative impact on individuals. For instance, people may feel frightened or disturbed by reports of violent crimes or natural disasters, leading to a range of negative emotions, including fear, sadness, and anger.Furthermore, the emphasis on negative news can also create a culture of fear and mistrust, where individuals become increasingly skeptical and cynical about the world around them. However, it is essential to note that news reports play a crucial role in keeping the public informed about important issues and events. A balanced approach to news reporting, one that includes a mix of positive and negative stories, is essential for promoting a more nuanced and accurate understanding of the world. By presenting a more balanced view of reality, the media can help mitigate the harmful effects of negative news and promote a more informed, engaged, and compassionate society. Ultimately, a balanced media can have a positive impact on both individuals and society as a whole.
112;The two tables below show the exchange students from universities in Europe to Australia between 2007 and 2009.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The two tables indicate the international students from universities in Europe to Australia, and from Australian universities to universities in Europe between 2007 and 2009. Overall, An increase in total can be seen from European students to Australia in 2009, while the total number of Australian student remained the same from 2007 to 2009.To go into detail, there are two countries the number of students increased from European international students to Australia. Specifically, It is Sweden, and Germany. It was 34,27 in 2007 in Sweden and Germany, whereas it was 42 and 62 in Sweden and Germany in 2009 respectively. Especially in German students, the number doubled. On the other hand, other countries, such as France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherland can be seen a slight reduction from 2007 to 2009. But the total number increased from 189 to 226, in 2007, and 2009.When it comes to Australian international students who study in Europe, have not changed the total number of students. It is 152, in 2007 and 2009. On the other hand, the number of students soared in two countries, such as France, and Germany.It was 37, 18 in France, and Germany in 2007 respectively. It increased to 58, 26 in France and Germany. In contrast, there are reduction in three countries, in Sweden, The United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Especially in the Netherland, the number of Australian students plummeted from 32 to 18 between 2007 and 2009.France and Germany in 2009.;The international student exchange between European universities and Australia has shown a notable trend between 2007 and 2009, as indicated by the data presented in the two tables. Overall, there is a visible increase in the total number of European students traveling to Australia in 2009 compared to the previous years. This surge in international students is a positive indicator of the growing appeal of Australian universities to European students.In contrast, the total number of Australian students studying abroad remained constant from 2007 to 2009, suggesting that while there is an interest in international education, the outward flow of students from Australia to Europe did not experience the same level of growth as the inward flow of students from Europe to Australia.A closer examination of the data reveals that certain European countries are leading this trend. Specifically, Sweden and Germany have shown significant increases in the number of students traveling to Australia. In 2007, the numbers were 34 for Sweden and 27 for Germany. However, by 2009, these numbers had increased substantially, with Sweden seeing an increase to 42 students and Germany experiencing a more dramatic rise to 62 students.This growth suggests that Australian universities are becoming increasingly attractive to students from these countries, possibly due to the reputation of Australian educational institutions, the appeal of Australian culture, or the perceived career benefits of studying in Australia. The specific reasons for this increase would require further investigation but indicate a positive development for international educational exchange and cooperation between Europe and Australia.
661;The typical teaching situation of a teacher and students in the class will not exist by the year 2050. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;For many years, the traditional teaching and learning (T&L) approach, i.e., having a teacher disseminating knowledge to a group of students in a classroom, is dominent over the world.With the advancement of information and communication technology, new learning approaches have been proposed and adopted. For example, students can now use computers to surf the internet to find information or knowledge they would like to study. Moreover, a number of pre-recorded education contents are now available online to provide classes/tutorials to learners. It is expected that this tradition T&L approach will not exist by 2050. Would it be true?There is no doube that there is an increasing number of T&L approaches due to emergence of new technologies. Together with the new approaches, we see there is a shift of the role of teachers these years, not only as one who is responsible to disseminate knowledge, but also a faciliator of learning. Teachers provide proper directions to students during their study, where current technology is not able to offer. Some people say the artificial technology is a threat, but still the accuracy of providing suggestions to students is not very high. Moreover, human teachers are able to provide emotional support to students. Studying is not just a robotic process of human beings. Students may encounter difficulties during the learning process and feel frustrated, which will eventually affect their progression in study. Human teachers could be more aware on this situation, not by the numeric assessment results, but the emotional behaviour of the students in the classroom, and provide prompt and proper counselling support and advice to the students.Also, it is still well-known that computers, even with AI, are weak in creating new knowledge. In the university setting, other than teaching the conventional knowledge, professors would disseminate their new research findings to the students in the class, with discussion among the students, inspiring them to the unexplored areas. This T&L process can only be effective when it happens in a classroom setting.In conclusion, technology may alter the way how we teach and learn. In spite of this, human teachers are also adaptive and certain roles of the teachers cannot be replaced by other tools or machines. Therefore, I believe that the tradition classroom T&L setting cannot be replaced completedly in the future.;The traditional classroom approach to Teaching and Learning (T&L) has been a cornerstone of education for centuries. However, it is expected that this approach will become obsolete by 2050, making way for a more modern and effective way of learning. In recent years, there has been a significant shift in the role of teachers, from being the sole disseminators of knowledge to facilitators of learning. This change acknowledges that the primary function of teachers is not only to impart knowledge, but also to create an environment that fosters curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking.The role of teachers as facilitators of learning is crucial, as it enables students to take ownership of their learning process. This approach encourages students to explore, discover, and learn at their own pace, with the teacher acting as a guide and mentor. Moreover, human teachers possess a unique ability to provide emotional support to students, which is essential for their social, emotional, and academic development. While technology can provide access to a vast amount of information, it lacks the emotional intelligence and empathy that human teachers can offer.The decline of the traditional classroom approach and the evolution of the teacher's role are inevitable. As we move towards a more technology-driven and student-centered approach to learning, the importance of human teachers will not diminish, but rather, will be redefined. Teachers will focus on providing individualized support, feedback, and guidance, helping students to navigate the vast amount of information available to them. By 2050, it is expected that the traditional classroom will be a thing of the past, replaced by a more flexible, adaptive, and effective approach to learning, where human teachers play a vital role in supporting the emotional, social, and academic growth of students.
803;The use of corporal punishment (physically hitting students) in schools is in decline, yet it should be used to improve behaviour.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people believe that modifying behaviour among school-going children can be achieved through corporal punishment, and that it being on the decline in schools, is actually a negative development. I strongly disagree with this this view as I am of the opinion that there are better ways of disciplining children to instill positive behaviour, than physically hitting them.Improvement of behaviour among children in schools can be achieved through teaching them good manners rather than using corporal punishment. This means that teachers and school staff should teach children acceptable and unacceptable behaviour as part of their school curriculum from the earleist age they enter school. This way, learners obtain knowledge required for them to practice good behaviour. For example, if a child is taught from primary school-going age that they should clean after their mess, they are likely to practise and carry this behaviour through to secondary school. That way, there would be no need to physically hit children. Although some may firmly believe that corporal punishment is a good form of discipline, it cannot be compared to the actual teaching of good behaviour.Moreover, corporal punishment is likely to produce a fearful and resentful child rather than a well mannered child. It has been found by many researchers that children are unlikely to change their bad behaviour because they are beaten up at school. The behaviour is most likely to get worse, instead, as learners become fearful and resent their learning environment. For instance, in South Africa, some learners were reported to be disrespectful to their teachers because of a bad relationship that existed between them and their teachers as a result of corporal punishment that was inflicted on them. While it may be true that some positive behaviour changes were seen among pupils due to use of corporal punishment, this is at a very small scale.In conclusion, I am of the view that the use of corporal punishment among school-going age children is not a desirable phenomenon, as it is unlikely to produce any required behavioural changes. Instead, instilling good manners in learners through teaching them is more effective, as physically hitting them may even worsen their undesirable behaviour.;The use of corporal punishment among school-going age children has been a long-standing debate, with many advocating for its abolition. In reality, corporal punishment is not a desirable phenomenon in educational settings. Instead of instilling discipline, it often leads to fear, resentment, and a negative attitude towards learning. Research has shown that physical punishment is not an effective means of changing bad behavior in children. In fact, studies have found that children who are beaten or physically punished at school are unlikely to change their behavior, as the punishment is often seen as a form of revenge rather than a corrective measure.On the other hand, teaching good manners and values to learners has proven to be a more effective approach. By incorporating character-building and social skills into the curriculum, schools can help children develop self-discipline, respect for others, and a sense of responsibility. This approach not only promotes positive behavior but also fosters a supportive and inclusive learning environment. By teaching children the importance of good manners and respect, educators can help them develop essential life skills, such as communication, empathy, and conflict resolution.Moreover, instilling good values and manners in learners through teaching is a more sustainable and humane approach. It encourages children to reflect on their actions, take responsibility for their mistakes, and make amends when necessary. This approach also helps to build trust and rapport between teachers and students, creating a positive and productive learning environment. In conclusion, corporal punishment is not an effective or desirable means of managing behavior in school-going age children. Instead, teaching good manners and values is a more effective and humane approach that promotes positive behavior, respect, and responsibility. By adopting this approach, educators can help children develop into capable, compassionate, and responsible individuals.
76;The world health organization recommends that people should eat five or more portion of fruit and vegetables per day. The bar chart shows the percentage of males and females in the UK by age group in 2006.You should write at least 150 words.;This bar chart depicts the percentage between male and female to eat five or above portion of fruit and vegetables per day in the UK. It is clear from the graph that the female is higher than male of percentage.According to what is shown, gradually increased from 19 to 34 ages same that from 35 to 54 ages. Between 55 and 64 ages is siginficant increased about between 19 and 24 ages, After that gradually decreased between 65 and 74. Although, Supposed to 25 and 34 ages, They the more consum but between 55 and 64 ages they is consum the highest. Also, The 75 age is the same percentage, unlike the all under 75 ages.To sum up, we could say that, the all ages is not equal between male and female in same percentage ages, except 75 age, They slight by 25 per cent between unisex. On other hand, Female and male is equal consume in 75 age.;The bar chart provided offers a fascinating insight into the eating habits of males and females in the UK, specifically regarding their daily consumption of fruits and vegetables. The chart clearly illustrates the percentage of males and females who consume five or more portions of fruits and vegetables per day. A cursory glance at the chart reveals a notable difference in the eating habits of males and females, with females exhibiting a higher percentage of consumption.It is evident from the graph that females have a significantly higher percentage of consuming five or more portions of fruits and vegetables daily compared to their male counterparts. This disparity suggests that females in the UK are more inclined to adhere to dietary recommendations that emphasize the importance of consuming a variety of fruits and vegetables for maintaining good health. The reasons behind this difference could be multifaceted, including differences in lifestyle, diet preferences, or even awareness and education about nutritional benefits.The implications of this chart are noteworthy, as consuming five or more portions of fruits and vegetables per day is associated with numerous health benefits, including reduced risks of heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. If females are indeed consuming more fruits and vegetables, it could contribute to differences in health outcomes between genders. Furthermore, this data could inform public health campaigns, suggesting a need to target dietary advice and interventions differently towards males to encourage an increase in their consumption of fruits and vegetables.In conclusion, the bar chart paints a picture of gender-based differences in dietary habits within the UK, highlighting a higher propensity among females to consume the recommended daily intake of fruits and vegetables. This difference underscores the need for tailored public health strategies to promote healthier eating habits across different demographics. By understanding and addressing these disparities, efforts can be made to improve overall public health and reduce gender-based health inequalities.
1426;The world is experiencing a dramatic increase in population, which is causing problems not only for poor, undeveloped countries, but also for industrialized and developed nations. Describe some of the problems that overpopulation causes, and suggest at least one possible solution.;You should write at least 250 words.You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.Nowadays, the population dramatically in most countries around the world. This is true for the developed and developing nations. Overpopulation a different number of problems. However, the government can these problems in many .There are several problems that the raising number of people in undeveloped countries causes. Firstly, it is very difficult to provide enough food for all people. Secondly, the government limits the number of children per family in school. In addition, in poorest countries usually have , and when the population increases, the number of . Finally, when too many people live on the land, the environment suffers.There are different problems that overpopulation causes in rich nations. Firstly, it is very difficult for governments to provide helpful public services in overcrowded cities. Moreover, there is generally a higher level of crimes being committed, such as drugs abuse, murders, thefts, . often cause by the high rates of unemployment.However, overpopulation problems in nations have two main which they are by governments. Firstly, the government must educate people about limiting the size of the family. For example, in China they have a policy called “one child policy” which limits the size of the family to one or two children, and this is beginning to have an effect on the world’s most crowded nation.To sum up, if the impulsive population increase continues, many more people will die of hunger in the poor countries. Also, in rich nations, the life in the cities will become more and more difficult.;The increasing population in undeveloped countries poses significant challenges to the well-being of its citizens and the environment. Firstly, providing sufficient food for the growing number of people becomes a daunting task. The strain on agricultural resources and the difficulty in distributing food to all areas exacerbate hunger and malnutrition issues. This can lead to a range of health problems and a decline in the overall quality of life.Secondly, the educational system is also affected, as governments are forced to limit the number of children per family that can attend school. This restriction can hinder the social and economic mobility of families, as education is a crucial factor in breaking the cycle of poverty. The limitation on educational opportunities can have long-term consequences on the country's development and competitiveness in the global economy.Lastly, overpopulation takes a toll on the environment, as the increased demand for resources and space leads to deforestation, pollution, and loss of biodiversity. The degradation of natural habitats and ecosystems can have irreversible consequences, threatening the very survival of the planet.However, it is worth noting that governments in these nations have two main strategies to address overpopulation issues. These strategies often involve a combination of family planning initiatives, education, and economic incentives to encourage smaller family sizes. Additionally, governments may invest in sustainable development projects, aiming to reduce the pressure on natural resources and promote environmentally friendly practices. By acknowledging the complexities of overpopulation and implementing effective solutions, governments can work towards creating a more sustainable and equitable future for their citizens. Ultimately, addressing overpopulation requires a multifaceted approach that balances the needs of the present with the necessities of the future.
1313;There are many things that can motivate people to perform well in their work. These can include the salary, job satisfaction or the chance to help others. What do you feel is the best motivation to do well at work?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"To perform well in a job, people have to be motivated. There are multiple strategies for employers to incentivise their employees. The most obvious one is the salary; however, job satisfaction and the ability to help people are other methods of improving performance at work.For the majority of the people, receiving their salary at the end of the month is their motivation. This is because money is necessary to fulfill the most basic needs and other materialistic desires. Employees see these opportunities when receiving their salary and therefore work to achieve money. Furthermore, performing well in a job can often lead to promotions with higher pay packages. To receive this, staff have to stand out positively in their jobs. Salary is therefore a key motivational tool for many workforce participants.However, money is far from being the only incentive. Another aspect affecting performance is job satisfaction. If a person is comfortable in their work, they are more likely to perform well. Therefore this motivational tool interlinks with salary, as when people are content and perform well, the chances of promotion increase. For some individuals though, only their passion can drive them. Prime examples for this are humanitarian jobs. The salaries are often not very high, but those choosing to work in this field are often very driven; their passion to help others is prioritised over their own salary.In conclusion, while income might be the most common motivational factor, it is unusual to be the sole incentive for working hard, and some people are motivated wholly due to other reasons.";The concept of motivation in the workplace has long been a topic of discussion among professionals and researchers. While salary is often considered a key motivational tool for many people, it is by no means the only factor that drives individuals to perform at their best. In fact, research has shown that job satisfaction and the ability to help others are equally important, if not more so, in improving performance at work.For many employees, a competitive salary is a fundamental requirement for job satisfaction. It provides a sense of financial security and recognition for their hard work and dedication. However, it is not the sole motivator. Job satisfaction, which encompasses a sense of purpose, autonomy, and fulfillment, plays a significant role in motivating employees to go above and beyond their job expectations. When individuals feel engaged and passionate about their work, they are more likely to be motivated to perform at higher levels.Moreover, the ability to help others is a powerful motivator that can significantly enhance job performance. Many people find meaning and purpose in their work when they know that it is making a positive impact on others. This can be particularly true for those in roles such as healthcare, education, and social work, where the ability to make a difference in people's lives is a primary driver of motivation. When employees feel that their work is contributing to the greater good, they are more likely to be motivated to deliver high-quality results and strive for excellence.In conclusion, while salary is an important motivator, it is not the only factor that drives performance at work. Job satisfaction and the ability to help others are equally important, if not more so, in motivating individuals to perform at their best. By recognizing and addressing these factors, organizations can create a more motivating and productive work environment that brings out the best in their employees.
1284;There is a moral necessity today for the richer countries of the world to help the poorer countries develop in terms of feeding the population, education and health care. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The world today is often divided into two categories, more developed and less developed countries. This division is significant in terms of health, wealth and education. To minimise this gap, it is argued that richer countries are morally responsible to support the less wealthy. I, personally, feel that the prosperous countries are obligated and expected to to contribute to the development of countries with weaker economies.To address this argument, the history of the wealthy countries is relevant. Many less developed countries are former colonies, therefore the wealthy countries had a historical impact on the less wealthy. Thus, richer countries’ economies were dependent on the currently less developed countries for their rich status. Furthermore, even today the wealthy countries contribute to the wealth inequality by exploiting the inhabitants of less developed countries, giving workers lower wages than people within their own countries. Due to this dependence on poorer countries and the influence that the richer countries have had on the imbalance, it can be concluded that richer countries are indeed morally obliged to help the less wealthy countries.Opposing this is the view that each country is in charge of their own inhabitants and that therefore they need to provide health, education and basic necessities for themselves. In addition, simply providing these three services would not lead to closing the wealth gap. It would rather be helpful to invest sustainably in poorer countries and help them create their own systems, allowing these countries to be self-sufficient.In conclusion, while there is a moral necessity for wealthy countries to aid the poorer ones, simply providing basic necessities is not sufficient. A more sustainable idea would be to teach countries to plan and provide for themselves by giving economic incentives.;The world today is often categorized into two distinct groups: more developed and less developed countries. This dichotomy has sparked a heated debate about the moral responsibility of richer nations to support their less wealthy counterparts. While it is argued that richer countries have a moral obligation to provide assistance, the issue is more complex than simply supplying basic necessities.On one hand, providing basic necessities such as food, shelter, and healthcare is a fundamental step in alleviating poverty and improving living standards. However, simply supplying these necessities would not lead to closing the wealth gap between more developed and less developed countries. This approach may even create a culture of dependency, where less developed countries rely solely on foreign aid rather than developing their own economies.To truly minimize the gap, richer countries must adopt a more holistic approach. This includes investing in education,ing and infrastructure, as well as promoting fair trade practices and economic development. By doing so, less developed countries can build their own capacity to generate wealth and stimulate economic growth. Furthermore, richer countries can share their expertise and technology to help less developed countries develop their own industries and sectors, thus reducing their reliance on foreign aid.In conclusion, while providing basic necessities is a crucial step in supporting less developed countries, it is not a panacea for closing the wealth gap. Richer countries must take a more comprehensive approach,,assistantone that prioritizes sustainable development, education, and economic growth. Only through such a multifaceted approach can we hope to minimize the gap between more developed and less developed countries, and create a more equitable and prosperous world for all.
1427;There is no longer enough natural resources to sustain current levels of economic growth. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Recently, the natural resources risen dramatically across the world due to population growth. Some people state that we enough resources. However, there are some individuals who disagree with this opinion. In this essay, the issues behind this phenomenon will be examined.On the one hand, some people state that if will continue to we cannot have a comfortable life because natural resources are limited. According to a if this situation will continue, the petrol will in 2050. Moreover, it is widely said that the will increase. This will make the amount of natural .On the other hand, there are some individuals who disagree with above-mentioned perception. The natural resources will technology. For example, the of technology such as cars a positive impact the society. By using this, we can the consumption of natural resources. Eventually, we will not need natural fuel. In my opinion, of natural is , I think the loss of it a negative impact the society because won’t have a comfortable life any more.In conclusion, I agree with the idea that there is no longer enough natural resources to sustain this situation. In order to our life, the governments countries should tackle this issue.;The world has witnessed a significant surge in the demand for natural resources over the past few decades, primarily driven by the rapid growth of the global population. As the population continues to rise, the strain on the planet's resources has become a pressing concern. While some individuals argue that we have sufficient resources to cater to the needs of the growing population, others vehemently disagree with this notion.On one hand, proponents of the idea that we have enough resources point to the advancements in technology and efficiency in resource utilization. They argue that with proper management and distribution, the existing resources can be stretched to meet the demands of the increasing population. Furthermore, they highlight the potential for discovering new reserves of natural resources, such as oil, gas, and minerals, which can supplement the existing supplies.On the other hand, critics of this view assert that the depletion of natural resources is a pressing issue that cannot be ignored. They contend that the current rate of consumption is unsustainable and will inevitably lead to the exhaustion of these resources. The alarming rate of deforestation, pollution, and climate change are cited as evidence of the devastating impact of human activities on the environment. Moreover, they argue that the unequal distribution of resources, with some regions facing severe scarcity while others have an abundance, further complicates the issue.In conclusion, the debate surrounding the sufficiency of natural resources is a complex and multifaceted issue. While some people believe that we have enough resources to sustain the growing population, others strongly disagree, citing the unsustainable consumption patterns and the environmental degradation that accompanies them. Ultimately, it is crucial to adopt a balanced approach, acknowledging both the potential for resource management and the need for sustainable practices to ensure the long-term availability of these resources. By doing so, we can work towards a future where the needs of the population are met without compromising the health of the planet.
1324;These days, many young people are not spending their weekends and holidays doing outdoor activities such as hiking or mountaineering. Why is that happening? How can they be encouraged to spend more time in the natural environment?;Nowadays, the younger generation tends to avoid recreational activities such as hiking or alpinism. It seems that young people prefer to spend their weekends indoors, gaming or engaging in other online activities. If that is the case, by promoting sports more actively and organising sports competitions, the schools could counteract this trend.Living in the era of technology, the wide availability and variety of online entertainment are compelling young people to spend a lot of their free time indoors, using their gadgets. Numerous relatively cheap forms of amusement, such as online games, videos, audiobooks and plenty of other activities, tempt teenagers to stay at home and lead more sedentary lifestyles. A recent survey revealed that the vast majority of students would prefer spending their weekends playing computer games, rather than in the nature. That is one clear reason why our modern youth is less interested in recreational sports.To address this issue, the school management could intervene and offer a better range of outdoor sports activities and competitions, both within the school curriculum and as extra-curricular activities. For example, high schools could increase the number of weekly football, running and climbing classes, and organise competitions at the end of each term. As a result, pushed by their desire to win, students would do more walking, jogging, running and mountaineering during the school term, in preparation for the competition. This would reduce the time spent online, lessen the students’ dependence on the Internet for entertainment, and eventually boost their desire to spend more time enjoying the natural environment.To sum up, screen addiction plays a major role in young people’s avoidance of various outdoor activities. Opening up more recreational sports and offering frequent competitions on school grounds is a great way to motivate more students to spend their leisure time in the nature.;The younger generation's growing disinterest in outdoor recreational activities such as hiking or alpinism is a concerning trend. With the rise of technology and screen time, many young people are opting for sedentary pursuits over physical activities that promote a connection with nature. This shift has significant implications for both physical and mental health, as well as the development of important life skills such as resilience and teamwork.However, schools have the potential to counteract this trend by promoting sports more actively and organizing sports competitions. By incorporating outdoor activities and sports into their curricula,, the educational system can encourage young people to engage in physical pursuits that foster a love for nature and adventure. For instance, schools can organize hiking trips, climbing competitions, or outdoor games that promote teamwork and physical exercise. Additionally,By taking a more proactive approach to promoting sports and outdoor activities, schools can play a vital role in shaping the interests and habits of the younger generation. Not only can this help to improve physical health and well-being, but it can also contribute to the development of important life skills such as leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving. Furthermore, schools can invite guest speakers, such as experienced hikers or climbers, to share their experiences and inspire students to take up outdoor activities. In conclusion, by promoting sports more actively and organizing sports competitions, schools can effectively counteract the trend of the younger generation's avoidance of recreational activities such as hiking or alpinism. By fostering a love for outdoor pursuits and physical activity, schools can help to promote healthier, more active, and more well-rounded young people.
919;To be labelled a ‘Work of Art’, a painting, sculpture or other art form should display certain qualities that are unique. However, over the past century there has been a decline in the quality of prize-winning artwork and it is now possible for quite ordinary pieces of art to be labelled ‘masterpieces ’ whilst true works of art pass unnoticed.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;For centuries, artworks have been titled  'Work of Art' based on their extraordinary qualities. However, some people argue that nowadays, the standards are decreasing and the labelling of substandard artworks as 'masterpieces' has become ubiquitous. The upcoming essay will discuss why I agree that original paintings are being neglected while usual ones are being praised.Firstly, the superficial nature of humans is responsible for this change. These days, people do not see the meaning behind the painting or the message the artist is trying to convey rather they buy those paintings which are popular and contemporary. To illustrate it further, in art auctions it can be seen that when one person bids on one painting, no matter whether it is good or bad, others also start putting their money on it. Thus it is clear that normal art forms are winning prizes due to public attention.Secondly, some artists might bribe the organizers of exhibitions to promote their canvas. Indeed, there have been some recorded instances when artists were caught while signing up deals to increase the sales of their work. If a certain artwork receives publicity then it is impossible that it would not have an influence on the public. This type of promotion skews a person's opinion about a certain picture and so are forced to think about purchasing it, leaving behind original ones. Therefore, it is apparent that the diabolical activities of painters are responsible for their works being labelled as masterpieces.To conclude, the maintenance of social position and influence of painters are the prime causes for the popularity of ordinary artworks and the negligence of true works. Hence I agree with the given statement.;The art world has witnessed a paradigm shift in recent years, with some arguing that standards are decreasing and subpar artworks are being mislabelled as'masterpieces'. I strongly agree with this sentiment, that original paintings are being neglected while mundane ones are being praised. One of the primary reasons for this phenomenon is the superficial nature of humans.Humans have always been drawn to what is trendy and popular, rather than what is truly meaningful and original. This superficiality has led to a culture where artworks are judged based on their monetary value, fame of the artist, and the prestige of the gallery, rather than their actual artistic merit. As a result, the art world has become a platform for artists to create works that are attention-grabbing and sensational, rather than thought-provoking and innovative. Original paintings that challenge the status quo and push the boundaries of artistic expression are often overlooked, while formulaic and predictable works are lavished with praise.The consequences of this trend are far-reaching and alarming. The art world is no longer a platform for artists to express themselves and showcase their talents, but rather a marketplace where commodities are bought and sold. The value of art is no longer measured by its emotional resonance, intellectual depth, or technical skill, but rather by its market value and popularity. As a result, original paintings that have the potential to inspire, educate, and challenge are being neglected, while mundane and unoriginal works are being praised and celebrated. In the following discussion, I will further explore the reasons behind this shift and argue that it is imperative to reevaluate our standards and priorities in the art world.
1338;Today children are spending much more time watching TV compared to the past. Why do you think this happens? Is this a positive or a negative change?;"A trend has emerged in the last two decades with youngsters watching more TV than ever before. One of the main reasons behind this issue is the recent advancements in technology in gaming and film industries. This tendency has both pros and cons, and will be further discussed in this essay.The latest developments in video game consoles attracted both children and adults to spend extra time watching TV, compared to the past. With interactive gaming characters and high quality graphics, children are more likely to spend long hours playing games in front of the TV. A recent survey showed that TV addiction among young people, for example, has significantly increased from 5% to 80%, which was supposedly caused by the introduction of advanced gaming consoles. This increase is also partially due to films, drama series and cartoons being easily available on pirated websites and various gaming platforms.This trend has had more negative than positive effects on young citizens. More time spent watching TV adversely affects the mental and physical wellbeing of a child. For instance, the obesity ratio among young individuals in the past 10 years has risen dramatically; this has caused further health problems such as anxiety and depression. However, TV can also be used in a positive way. It is a great source of information that can help youngsters increase their knowledge and succeed in their future careers.In conclusion, recent breakthroughs in technology are driving up the amount of time our youngsters are spending in front of their TV screens. This can do more harm than good if we don’t regulate the use of TV, but parents have the power to make TV time useful and beneficial for their children.";The last two decades have witnessed a concerning trend among youngsters, with a significant increase in the amount of time spent watching television. This phenomenon has become a pressing issue, with far-reaching consequences for the physical and mental health of young people. One of the primary reasons behind this trend is the rapid advancements in technology, particularly in the gaming and film industries.The advent of high-definition displays, surround sound systems, and sophisticated gaming consoles has made television a more immersive and engaging experience. The gaming industry, with its interactive and often addictive games, has played a significant role in drawing youngsters to the screen. Similarly, the film industry, with its production of high-quality,s and engaging content, has made television a more appealing option for young people.A recent survey has highlighted the gravity of the situation, revealing that TV addiction among young people has increased dramatically from 5% to 80%. This staggering rise is a cause for concern, as excessive television viewing has been linked to a range of negative effects, including obesity, social isolation, and decreased attention span. Furthermore, it can also lead to a decline in physical activity, poor academic performance, and decreased creativity.The implications of this trend are far-reaching, and it is essential that parents, educators, and policymakers take notice of this issue. It is crucial to promote a balanced and healthy lifestyle among young people, one that combines recreational activities with physical exercise, social interaction, and cognitive stimulation. By doing so, we can mitigate the negative effects of TV addiction and ensure that young people develop into well-rounded, active, and engaged members of society. Ultimately, it is our responsibility to address this issue and promote a healthier relationship between young people and television.
603;Today family members do not eat meals together. Why does this happen? Is this a positive or negative developmentGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Dinner tables are no longer a place for family reunion in today's society. Reasons from many aspects account for this phenomenon which pose a huge threat to the happiness of family and the harmony of society.Causes vary from person to person. Some people, especially the young believing that conflicts are common on dinner tables, tend to have meals with their friends rather than their family members. But most people are deprived of their rights by the development of society. Too busy to get home at dinner time, people have to eat meals near workplace. Also, with the job diversity increasing, rarely can family members with different timetables eat meals at the same period. For instance, a bank agent getting home at 6 pm tends to miss her doctor husband leaving home at 5 pm for emergency work.It is the advantages of sharing meals with family that attach great importance to this event. Time for communication is so critical that families lacking such opportunities are often full of misunderstandings and quarrels. Not only can this development increase the divorce rate but it may also decrease the marriage rate. Because support and care from family, the previous harbor, is deprived and people see no significance from getting married. With such phenomenon prevailing, the negative emotions may take advantage in the society. Loneliness, distress and helplessness stike those always eating alone.In a nutshell, taking the damage to both families and societies into consideration, various solutions should be put forward to the roots behind the situation.;The traditional dinner table, once a symbol of family unity and togetherness, has become a relic of the past in today's society. The notion that dinner tables are no longer a place for family reunion is a disturbing reality that poses a significant threat to the happiness of families and the harmony of society. This phenomenon can be attributed to various factors from different aspects of modern life.From a technological perspective, the widespread use of digital devices has led to a decline in face-to-face interactions during meals. Family members are often more engrossed in their screens than in conversations with each other, resulting in a sense of isolation and disconnection. Furthermore, the rise of busy schedules and hectic lifestyles has made it challenging for families to find time to gather together for meals. The demands of work, school, and extracurricular activities have led to a culture of grab-and-go meals, where family members often eat alone or on-the-run.Additionally, the breakdown of traditional family structures and the increase in single-parent households have also contributed to the decline of dinner tables as a hub for family reunions. The erosion of family values and the lack of emphasis on quality time spent together have further exacerbated this issue. The consequences of this phenomenon are far-reaching, leading to a decline in emotional support, communication, and a sense of belonging among family members. Ultimately, the disintegration of dinner tables as a place for family reunion threatens the very fabric of our society, leading to a breakdown in social cohesion and community harmony. It is essential that we recognize the importance of reviving this tradition and make a conscious effort to prioritize family time and togetherness around the dinner table.
883;Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;There is no doubt that nowadays advertising plays a very strong role in saling goods. The high rate of sales does not always mean the real needs of some goods. In this essay, i will discuss both views and draw my personal conclusion.In terms of advertising's power in increasing sales of popular consumer goods, advertising has an essencial role these days in sales. The main reason given to support this claim is advertisnig attracts people and inform people about the new and special products in a very special way. To illustrate, using social media for marketing and advertising raise sales dramatecly. People spend most of their times to watch what is in the social media and that means social media is the best way to do your marketing.However, some people say that people buy these products not because they really need them but because they like the way that was used to advertise these products. On the other hand, some times people purchase goods because they have seen them or heard about them from others or from the social media not due to their needs of these products.In conclusion, I believe that increasing the sales of some popular consumer goods show how strong is advertising and how advertising plays a crucial role in saling products. Also, smart business owners should think about advertising as a fast way to sale their goods. As was previously menthond, people can be attracted by all kinds of advertising and that definitly lead to increasing the sale rate.;The role of advertising in selling goods has become increasingly prominent in today's market. It is undeniable that advertising plays a vital part in boosting sales and promoting products to a wider audience. However, the question remains as to whether the high rate of sales generated by advertising necessarily reflects the real needs of the goods being sold.On the one hand, some argue that advertising is a key driver of sales, and that high demand for a product is a clear indication of its usefulness and necessity. They claim that advertising simply informs consumers about the existence and benefits of a product, and that it is up to the individual to decide whether or not to purchase it. From this perspective, the high rate of sales is a reliable indicator of a product's value and relevance to society.On the other hand, others contend that advertising can be misleading and manipulative, creating artificial demand for products that people do not really need. They argue that advertising often uses psychological tactics to persuade consumers to buy goods that may not be essential or even desirable. In this view, high sales figures do not necessarily reflect the genuine needs of consumers, but rather the effectiveness of the advertising campaign.In conclusion, while advertising undoubtedly plays a significant role in driving sales, I believe that high sales rates do not always reflect the real needs of the goods being sold. Advertising can be a powerful tool for shaping consumer preferences and creating demand, but it is up to consumers to critically evaluate the information presented to them and make informed decisions about their purchasing habits. Ultimately, it is essential to strike a balance between the benefits of advertising and the potential for manipulation, ensuring that consumers are able to make choices that truly reflect their needs and values.
1328;Today’s young generation is facing many problems at school and at home. What are the problems? What can parents do to help their teenage children?;"Young people today are under a lot of pressure, which seems to come from many directions. The problems they are experiencing happen not only at school, but also at home, and it seems that without adult guidance, our young generation will continue to struggle.Teenage years have never been simple, and many would agree that the amount of challenges has only increased with the passage of time. Bullying has been a problem for quite a while, and children and adolescents would have experienced it at school in the past, but then it would stop at home. At present, however, things have been made worse by social media penetrating the supposedly safe space of our teenagers. The unfortunate behaviour of their peers can now reach them even in their bedrooms, causing them constant distress.Another issue troubling many young people is the pressure to succeed by their families. Whether at school or at home, they often feel as if they are not smart enough, which creates overwhelm and despair. Understandably, their parents are pursuing a worthy goal of ensuring their children get a great start in life; however, many teens feel that they are failing their families when they don’t live up to their expectations. This often leads to dishonest and unethical behaviour, such as cheating on tests or plagiarising other students’ work. When uncovered, these incidents have a profound effect on young people’s future careers, not to mention their emotional well-being.It is hard to underestimate the importance of parental support to navigating life as a young person. From helping teens build a positive body image and self-esteem, to handling classmates’ difficult behaviour, to guidance where study is concerned, parents can make a world of difference. Talking to their sons and daughters about matters that worry them, listening and making non-judgmental suggestions are great ways to help. Getting a professional involved where necessary and engaging with teachers, councilors and coaches is another opportunity for parents to provide assistance. Last but not least, parents can make their children better and happier people by simply giving them unconditional love.To sum up, being a young person in the modern world isn’t easy. By banding together and paying careful attention to their teens, families can help them overcome any obstacles to becoming successful adults.";The lives of young people today are marked by an unprecedented level of pressure. This pressure emanates from multiple sources, making their journey to adulthood increasingly challenging. Not only do they face academic expectations and social dynamics at school, but they also encounter a myriad of issues at home. The cumulative effect of these pressures can be overwhelming, potentially hindering their ability to thrive and become successful adults.The problems faced by teenagers are multifaceted and deeply intertwined with both their school and home environments. At school, they are often burdened with rigorous academic schedules, extracurricular activities, and the pressure to excel in various fields to secure their future. Meanwhile, at home, they may deal with family conflicts, financial stress, or even personal struggles, all of which can significantly impact their mental health and overall well-being.However, there is a beacon of hope for these young individuals. By coming together and offering supportive environments, families can play a pivotal role in helping teenagers navigate these challenges. Parents, guardians, and other family members must be vigilant and attentive to the needs and struggles of their teens. Open communication, understanding, and unconditional support are key elements in fostering an environment where young people feel secure and encouraged to face their obstacles head-on.Moreover, collective family efforts can empower teenagers with the resilience and strategies necessary to overcome adversity. By promoting a sense of unity and cooperation, families can help mitigate the pressures that young people face, both in and out of school. This unified approach not only strengthens family bonds but also equips teenagers with the tools and mindset to achieve their full potential. Ultimately, the collaborative support of family members can be the defining factor that helps young people successfully transition into capable, confident, and successful adults.
1310;Tourism today creates a variety of problems, such as pollution due to flights, transport and dirty water.Do you think that governments should impose extra taxes on flights or accommodation to restrict today’s tourism industry?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Travelling today is simple to the extent that within twelve hours one can travel from Europe to Singapore, crossing nearly the whole globe. Based on this simplicity, tourism has changed significantly over the years. While in the past a family would be proud to drive two hours to a lake, many families now think nothing of travelling to the far side of the world. This also has a downside as increased pollution is a result. Extra taxes on flights or accommodation have therefore been offered as a solution so as to increase the cost of tourism and reduce its popularity.No matter what major transportation is used, travelling creates pollution. To decrease the amount of pollution caused by tourism, the tourism industry itself would have to be weakened. If these increased taxes are based on travelling distance, people would be more willing to stay closer to their home country, as for many even a slight increase would mean that their planned holidays would be too expensive. Accommodation taxes would raise holiday costs no matter the distance travelled. Therefore, if increased taxes were levied on travel and accommodation, tourism and therefore pollution would decrease.On the other hand, the main transport methods that would be impacted by imposing extra taxes would be communal ones, such as planes, trains and buses, and increasing the taxes would also impact non-tourists. Also, holidays are a vital part of ordinary people’s lives, as they escape from work and stress, and get to spend valuable time with their families. Stopping people travelling would greatly impact some simple pleasures of ordinary life.In conclusion, while tourism impacts the environment significantly, simply introducing extra taxes on transport or accommodation is a drastic measure. It could be more valuable to change the methods of transportation to decrease pollution, instead making people stay close to home.;The tourism industry has become a significant contributor to environmental pollution, with the increasing number of travelers leading to a substantial rise in greenhouse gas emissions and degradation of natural habitats. To mitigate this issue, a proposed solution is to impose extra taxes on flights or accommodation, which would increase the cost of tourism and subsequently reduce its popularity. This approach is based on the premise that a decrease in tourism would lead to a reduction in pollution caused by the industry.However, this solution requires a weakening of the tourism industry itself, which could have far-reaching economic implications. The tourism sector is a significant source of revenue and employment for many countries, and a decline in tourism could lead to economic instability. Nevertheless, if the goal is to decrease pollution caused by tourism, then a reduction in tourism activity is necessary.One possible way to achieve this reduction is by levying increased taxes on travel and accommodation. This would make tourism more expensive, leading to a decrease in the number of travelers. As a result, the environmental impact of tourism would be diminished, and the pollution caused by the industry would be reduced. While this solution may have economic drawbacks, it is a necessary step towards mitigating the environmental damage caused by tourism. Ultimately, the imposition of extra taxes on flights or accommodation could be an effective way to reduce the popularity of tourism and decrease the amount of pollution caused by the industry. By taking this step, we can work towards a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly tourism sector.
1229;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;While some people argue that equal numbers of male and female students should be accepted in every major, I personally disagree with this statement.There are a number of arguments that can support my stance. To begin with, it is impossible to enroll equal genders of students in every subject. It is true that some faculties are underrepresented by a particular gender. For example, STEM subjects usually have more male students than females, but the opposite is true in educational-related subjects, which phenomenon seems to violate the principle that we fight endeavor today, gender equality. Therefore, people want to accept equal numbers of students to achieve a gender balance in every subject. However, the reality is that different genders prefer to study different subjects themselves, but not because of the unequal opportunity. According to one of the research, women show a higher interest in subjects like education, psychology and arts rather than science-related subjects. As a result, it is apparent that admitting equivalent proportions of male and female students can hardly be achieved.In addition, it will deprive students of chances to make their own choices if universities enroll both genders equally in every subject mandatorily. It should be noted that it is students' right to select the subjects freely in college. If students cannot register for the subjects they want to study just because there are not enough quotas left for particular gender of students, or they are forced to study some subjects they are not interested in just because they need to fulfill the gender requirement in the class, it will hinder students' learning in the long-run.To conclude, universities should not enroll equal gender students in every subject as it is impossible to achieve and may deprive students the freedom to choose the major they want to study.;The issue of equal representation of male and female students in every major has sparked a heated debate. Some argue that universities should strive to achieve a balanced ratio of male and female students in each field of study. However, this approach is not only impractical but also ignores the inherent differences in interests and preferences between genders.It is impossible to enroll equal numbers of male and female students in every subject, as different fields naturally attract different demographics. For instance, subjects like engineering and computer science tend to attract more male students, while fields like nursing and education tend to attract more female students. This disparity is not a result of unequal opportunities, but rather a reflection of the different passions and strengths that individuals possess.Research has shown that these preferences are deeply rooted in individual interests and aptitudes, rather than societal expectations or biases. For example, a study may find that more women are drawn to fields like psychology and sociology, not because they are discouraged from pursuing other subjects, but because they are genuinely interested in understanding human behavior and social dynamics. Similarly, men may be more inclined to pursue careers in physics and mathematics, as they find these subjects fascinating and challenging.In conclusion, attempting to enforce equal numbers of male and female students in every major is not only unrealistic but also neglects the unique preferences and strengths of each gender. Rather than trying to artificially balance the ratios, universities should focus on providing equal opportunities and resources to all students, regardless of their chosen field of study. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and supportive learning environment, where individuals can pursue their passions and reach their full potential.
1433;Universities should allocate the same amount of money to their sport activities as they allocate to their libraries. Do you agree or disagree?;Yes, I do feel that universities should have an equal budget for their libraries as well as sport activities. It is our general belief that a good player can not be good student and hence we restrict our children’s sport activities at college level. Moreover, an academic degree has much more value than sport activities which naturally compels students to focus more on their studies than their interest in sport.Most of the universities keep sports at of their priority list, good players do not get enough facilities and to improve their skills and eventually they their interest.Universities can play substantial role in shaping this upcoming talent by providing good trainers and which is otherwise too expensive to afford. Also it will attract other students sports and inculcate importance of physical fitness in them.Universities should produce in all fields rather than only concentrating on progress of scholars. Hence, I feel that universities should allot equal amounts of money to as well as sport activities.;The age-old debate about the allocation of university budgets has sparked a significant amount of discussion in recent years. While some argue that libraries should be the primary focus of university funding, others claim that sports activities are equally important. In my opinion, universities should have an equal budget for their libraries as well as sports activities. It is often assumed that a student who excels in sports cannot be a good student, and vice versa. This misconception has led to the restriction of sports activities at the college level, with many parents and educators prioritizing academic pursuits over physical ones. However, this approach is not only limiting but also misguided. Research has shown that students who participate in sports activities tend to perform better academically, as physical exercise improves cognitive function and boosts overall well-being. By allocating an equal budget to libraries and sports activities, universities can provide students with a well-rounded education that encompasses both academic and physical development. Libraries are essential for providing students with access to resources, textbooks, and study spaces, while sports facilities offer a platform for students to engage in physical activity, develop teamwork skills, and build camaraderie with their peers. Furthermore, having a strong sports program can also have numerous benefits for the university as a whole, such as attracting top talent, fostering school spirit, and providing an outlet for students to manage stress and anxiety. In conclusion, universities should prioritize both academic and physical development by allocating an equal budget to libraries and sports activities. By doing so, they can provide students with a holistic education that prepares them for success in all aspects of life. It is time to break away from the traditional mindset that a good player cannot be a good student, and instead, nurture students who excel in both academics and sports.
1387;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;Today computers are used almost everywhere, it is impossible to imagine our life without PCs, Internet, mobile phones and other computer devices. It is reasonable to think that people look forward to the future of computers., computers make our life easier, we can easily get information about any product we plan to buy or place we plan to visit in a second using a personal computer and . Scientists predict that in the nearest future it will be possible to smell a new perfume using the Internet and watch 3D scenes at home like we do in the movie theater. According to forecasts of HR agencies machines will replace jobs of cashiers, and civil and military pilots. Some corporations in Japan are already sellinghousewife-robots, which help old people to keep their homes clean.Despite the fact that computers help us, they make us dependent. Apparently, people spend more time behind monitors than ever before. And some of them feel a need for more time to be spent with people in live contact. In addition, a breakdown of one of the important modules of a specific computer can entail serious consequences. to mention the computer problem that occurred in the end of 1990s, a problem related to the coming year 2000 (Y2K) and catastrophes that were predicted. Fortunately imminent disasters did not happen. However, it is difficult to imagine what could if all the predictions came true.We live in a technological era, computers penetrated everywhere with all benefits they provide and all dangers they hide. However we are satisfied with them and sometimes we even thank them because they help us in communicating, studying, doing business, entertaining and saving lives in critical situations.;The world is on the cusp of a technological revolution that will transform the way we live, work, and interact with one another. According to recent predictions, it will soon be possible to smell a new perfume over the internet, a phenomenon that was previously unimaginable. This innovation will be made possible by advancements in digital technology, allowing us to experience scents remotely. Furthermore, scientists forecast that we will be able to watch 3D scenes at home with the same level of quality and immersion as we currently experience in movie theaters. This will revolutionize the entertainment industry, making high-quality cinematic experiences accessible to everyone in the comfort of their own homes.In addition to these innovations, HR agencies are predicting significant changes in the job market. With the rise of automation and artificial intelligence, machines are expected to replace certain professions, including cashiers, civil pilots, and military pilots. While this may seem alarming, it also presents opportunities for workers to transition into new roles that are complementary to automation. As machines take over routine and repetitive tasks, human workers will be freed up to focus on more complex and creative endeavors.These forecasts underscore the rapid pace of technological progress and the need for workers to adapt to a changing job market. As we move forward, it will be essential to prioritize education and retraining programs that equip workers with the skills needed to thrive in an increasingly automated world. By embracing these changes and preparing for the future, we can harness the potential of technology to improve our lives and create new opportunities for growth and innovation. Ultimately, the future holds much promise, and with the right mindset and preparation, we can navigate the challenges and seize the benefits that technological advancements will bring.
1396;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in the future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;In the last two decades cybernetics have experienced a major breakthrough .This led to the utilization of computers in nearly all parts of our daily life, from personal computers to the ones performing complicated surgeries. Surely the uptake of this technology facilitates a lot of difficult tasks but is this excessive ripping the warmth out of our lives? .Most of the daily tasks individual experiences are time and effort consuming. These two qualities could be tremendously saved by the use of computers. The average period required to prepare a decent meal for a middle-class family is around an hour to hour and a half when using traditional methods. This time could be literally reduced to half if computerized are used instead. Moreover, a busy businessman is enabled to easily close a profitable deal with just a touch highly programmed laptop while enjoying his family vacation and not having to exert an extra effort of traveling long distances in order to a deal.On the other hand, new generations are growing remarkably dependent on these modern utilities, which makes them handicapped when it comes to a cup of tea. , psychologists suggest that one of the main reasons for rate increase is the recent electric inventions. This is due to the fact that humans by nature stay emotionally healthy through socializing, but due to the importance of modern technology to maintain a financially satisfying standard of life they gradually themselves. As time passes by each of these individuals gets stuck in a vicious circle of loneliness that eventually leads to suicidal attempts especially among youngsters.In conclusion, similarly to every other invention computers have their benefits and drawbacks, I personally think it all depends upon how we use the given tools . Moderation is the key here to keep the balance and allow us to live in harmony.;The advent of modern technology has revolutionized the way we live, working, and interact with one another. On one hand, the average period required to prepare a decent meal for a middle-class family using traditional methods is around an hour to an hour and a half. This time-consuming process has been significantly reduced with the introduction of modern appliances and gadgets. However, the irony lies in the fact that while technology has made our lives easier, it has also made the new generation remarkably dependent on these modern utilities.A busy businessman, for instance, is enabled to easily close a profitable deal with just a touch of his highly programmed laptop. This level of convenience and efficiency has transformed the way we conduct business and communicate with one another. Nevertheless, this over-reliance on technology has a downside. The new generation, who have grown up with these modern utilities, is finding it challenging to perform even the simplest of tasks without them. For example, making a cup of tea, which was once a straightforward process, has become a daunting task for many. This is a clear indication that our dependence on technology has made us handicapped in many ways.The ability to perform basic tasks, such as cooking and preparing meals, is essential for independence and self-sufficiency. While technology has undoubtedly made our lives easier, it is crucial that we strike a balance between utilizing these modern utilities and maintaining our basic skills. By doing so, we can ensure that the benefits of technology do not come at the cost of our ability to function without them. Ultimately, it is essential that we recognize the importance of maintaining our traditional skills, lest we become too reliant on technology and lose our sense of self-sufficiency.
1348;When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers (agree/disagree);When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers for people to spend their free time. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Sample EssaySome people argue that town planners should have a preference for more parks and gyms to be created than business districts and shopping malls. While I understand the concerns of people who hold this opinion, it seems to me that shopping centers are just as important as parks and gyms in a town.There are reasons why public facilities are crucial to city inhabitants. First of all, they provide suitable spaces and equipment for people to exercise. For example, people can go jogging in the park and play tennis or basketball at the sports stadium. That helps to keep their bodies fit and it also elevates their mood during the day. Besides, parks and sports facilities are good spots for people to socialize with their neighbors. People can connect with others when they are playing sports or talking casually with passers by in the park. A harmonious relationship between residents helps build a caring and friendly neighborhood.Although parks and gyms give the town dwellers all kinds of benefits, I would like to point out the importance of shopping malls to the district. Firstly, a shopping center could make shopping more convenient for the local residents. It would enable them to easily purchase things in town and transport them home with less effort and at lower cost. They would not need to spend extra money on transportation or shipping of the goods. Secondly, a shopping mall can provide employment. Locals can find work in retail, maintenance or security of the mall, hence earning an income to support their families.In conclusion, although parks and sports facilities serve as places for exercise and social activities for city dwellers, I believe that shopping centers are equally important, since they can provide job opportunities and convenience to the town residents.This essay would score well on Task Achievement because it addresses all parts of the question, discusses reasons for and against building more parks than shopping malls and expresses the opinion of the writer. The main ideas are organized well and explained coherently. The range of vocabulary is adequate for the requirements of the task response. Overall, this essay could get Band 8 in IELTS.;When new towns are planned, the allocation of space for public facilities is a crucial aspect to consider. While some may argue that shopping centers are essential for a town's economic growth, I strongly believe that building more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers is vital for the well-being of its residents. In my opinion, this approach is more beneficial for several reasons.On the one hand, public parks and sports facilities provide a space for people to engage in physical activities, relax, and socialize. This is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, reducing stress, and fostering a sense of community. Moreover, public parks and sports facilities are often accessible to people of all ages and income levels, making them an inclusive space for everyone. In contrast, shopping centers tend to cater to a specific demographic and can be a source of noise pollution, traffic congestion, and consumerism.On the other hand, some may argue that shopping centers are necessary for a town's economic growth, as they create jobs and stimulate local businesses. However, I disagree that this should be the primary focus. While economic growth is important, it should not come at the cost of residents' quality of life. In fact, public parks and sports facilities can also contribute to the local economy by attracting tourists and supporting small businesses that offer recreational services.In conclusion, I firmly believe that when planning new towns, it is essential to prioritize the construction of public parks and sports facilities over shopping centers. This approach will not only promote a healthier and more harmonious community but also create a more sustainable and balanced environment for residents to spend their free time. By doing so, we can ensure that the needs of people are put before the interests of businesses, and a better quality of life is achieved for all.
47;While many people go to university for academic study, more people should be encouraged to do vocational training because there is a lack of qualified workers such as electricians and plumbers. Do you agree or disagree?;Some believe that people should be encouraged more to study practical courses than going to university to fulfill the lack of workforce in practical areas. I agree with this proposal to some degree, because, from my knowledge, there is a lack in both fields, academic and vocational experts. Moreover, academic studies and vocational ones are equally important for every society, and not everybody can study the same thing, so both studies should be encouraged.Qualified workers and professional academics are equally needed in many parts of the world. This is because as the population grows the people's needs do it too, and this happens in all shapes and areas. While living in Argentina, I noticed the need of professionals in fields such as medicine and technology, especially robotics. In England, however, I observed the lack of plumers and carpenters. Consequently, every country needs different things.Furthermore, if strong encouragement is put on studying vocational courses only, this could be detrimental to the academic field. Essentially, both study systems are equally important. A hospital needs doctors to treat people as well as electricians to maintain the building. Besides, not everybody is good at everything. Some might be good at performing practical tasks and some good at thinking. In my family, I am the one who studied at the university, but my sister studied dressmaking. Both of us have jobs nowadays.In conclusion, I believe that the two types of studies should be stimulated. Countries worldwide are in lack of different experts, either in the vocational or academic field, hence, both workers are equally essential and needed. Besides and more importantly, not every individual can study the same subject or perform in the same area.;The debate about whether people should be encouraged to pursue practical courses over university education has sparked a heated discussion. Some argue that prioritizing practical courses can help alleviate the shortage of skilled workers in various industries. However, this perspective overlooks the fact that there is a scarcity of experts in both academic and vocational fields.While it is true that certain industries face a significant shortage of skilled workers, it is also important to recognize that academic pursuits play a crucial role in driving innovation and progress. Universities produce not only intellectuals but also thinkers, researchers, and problem-solvers who contribute to the advancement of various disciplines. Neglecting academic education could have far-reaching consequences, potentially stifling scientific breakthroughs and technological advancements.Moreover, and more importantly, every individual has unique strengths, interests, and abilities. Not everyone is suited for practical courses, just as not everyone is cut out for academic pursuits. The notion that people should be funneled into practical courses neglects the diversity of human potential and the importance of personal fulfillment. Forcing individuals into a particular field can lead to dissatisfaction, decreased motivation, and ultimately, a lack of expertise in that area.Rather than prioritizing one over the other, it is essential to strike a balance between academic and vocational education. By providing equal opportunities and resources for both paths, we can ensure that individuals can pursue their passions and interests, ultimately leading to a more skilled and diverse workforce. By acknowledging and embracing the diversity of human potential, we can foster a society that values and supports the development of all individuals, regardless of their chosen field of study.
1380;Why do criminals commit another offence after being punished?;"Many offenders commit more crimes after serving the first punishment. Why is this happening, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?It is true that some criminals commit crimes again after they have been punished. While there are several reasons for this alarming trend, some effective measures can be taken by governments to tackle this problem.There are two main reasons for re-offenders. Firstly, the prison system can make the situation worse. Criminals put together in prison and they make friends with other offenders. While they are locked up in prison, they do not have much to do there, and they would exchange information about what they have done before they came to the prison or they may plan crimes with other inmates. Secondly, offenders often do not have any other means of earning money. They are poor, uneducated and lacking skills needed to maintain a job. Also, a criminal record makes finding a job difficult as people usually avoid hiring .To solve this problem, governments should focus on rehabilitation of criminals rather than punishment. Above all, prisons need vocational training which inmates to prepare for life outside the prison. They can learn practical skills such as computer programming, car maintenance and graphic design. In this way, they can be hired for a position that requires this certain knowledge and skills. Community service is another way to reform offenders. Rather than being locked up in prison with other inmates, offenders can help society and become useful to their local community, and these activities would eliminate the negative influence that prisons can have.In conclusion, it is true the one of the problems our community; it can be solved by focusing rather than punishment itself.This is a good essay. The requirements of the task statement are covered, the reasoning is logical and presented in a coherent, easy to follow way, the range of vocabulary is wide enough and the writer shows fluency and flexibility. Some minor errors in this essay include word choice and preposition errors (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows suggested corrections). Overall this looks like an IELTS Band 8 essay.";The issue of repeat offenders committing more crimes after serving their initial punishment is a pressing concern for the criminal justice system. One of the primary reasons for this phenomenon is the prison system itself. By congregating criminals in a single location, prisons inadvertently create an environment where offenders can form friendships and networks with other like-minded individuals. This can lead to the exchange of ideas, techniques, and experiences, ultimately perpetuating a cycle of crime.Furthermore, many offenders lack the necessary means to earn a living upon their release. Poverty, lack of education, and insufficient skills hinder their ability to secure and maintain employment. Without a stable source of income, these individuals may resort to crime as a means of survival, thereby perpetuating the cycle of recidivism. This highlights the need for a more holistic approach to rehabilitation, one that addresses the socio-economic factors that contribute to criminal behavior.To tackle this problem, measures can be taken to reform the prison system and provide offenders with the necessary tools to reintegrate into society. This can include vocational training, education programs, and counseling to equip offenders with the skills and knowledge required to secure employment. Additionally, efforts can be made to provide support and resources upon release, such as job placement services, housing assistance, and mental health support. By addressing the root causes of recidivism and providing offenders with a legitimate means of earning a living, we can work towards reducing the likelihood of repeat offenses and creating a safer, more just society. Ultimately, a comprehensive approach to rehabilitation is essential to breaking the cycle of crime and ensuring that offenders do not reoffend upon release.
1400;With all the problems in the world today, spending money on space exploration is a complete waste. The money could be better spent on other causes.;, every day, every year, celebrates its achievements in space exploration. However, it is now the time to question how meaningful these blasts are.First, until all urgent and important matters of the globe have been solved, money on space exploration is meaningless. It at all to invest millions of dollars researching and producing foods for astronauts (for space exploration purpose), while every day thousands of people are starving. Furthermore, the discovery of outer space only serves a minor group of people if the majority well-educated. do no even know how to prevent common threatening diseases such as AIDS and lung cancer.Then, some may argue that the purpose of space exploration to discover new lands, new energy resources or to deter potential threat to . Nevertheless, is it effective to do so while other alternatives are available? yet effectively used. New energy resources (e.g. solar and nuclear energy) have not yet been widely-used. Threats of plagues have not yet been deterred. All of these tasks that haven’t been tackled yet require money. That is why costly space discovery programs are a waste of resources.In a nutshell, people should only invest in space exploration provided that urgent and important matters mentioned earlier in this essay have been solved. Also, purposes of space exploration campaigns should be studied carefully and other alternatives should be considered before the money is wasted.;As the world celebrates its achievements in space exploration every day and every year, it is imperative to step back and reassess the significance of these endeavors. The excitement and wonder that accompany each new discovery and milestone are undeniable, but it is now time to question how meaningful these blasts are. First and foremost, until all urgent and important matters of the globe have been solved, spending money on space exploration seems meaningless. There are still numerous pressing issues on Earth that demand immediate attention and resources, such as poverty, hunger, disease, and climate change. Billions of dollars are being allocated to space programs, while many people around the world lack access to basic necessities like clean water, food, and shelter. It is contradictory to prioritize exploring the cosmos when there are still so many unmet needs on our own planet.Moreover, the justification that space exploration drives innovation and improves daily life on Earth is not sufficient to warrant the enormous expenditure. While it is true that advancements in space technology have led to improvements in fields like medicine, transportation, and communication, these benefits could potentially be achieved through other, less costly means. The opportunity cost of investing in space exploration is staggering, and it is essential to weigh these costs against the potential benefits.In conclusion, while space exploration has its merits and can inspire future generations, it is crucial to reevaluate our priorities. The globe's pressing issues should take precedence over cosmic ambitions. Only when we have made significant strides in addressing the urgent matters on Earth can we truly justify and celebrate our achievements in space exploration with a clear conscience. Until then, the money spent on space travel and discovery will remain a luxury we can hardly afford.
1312;With the increase in computer use, many people feel that schools do not need to put the emphasis that they used to on basic handwriting skills or mental mathematics skills.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;In recent years, computer use around the world has increased drastically. As a result technological equipment is used increasingly in schools around the world. Many people question therefore whether schools should put much emphasis on teaching students basic handwriting skills and mental mathematics skills.The use of technological equipment in lessons has increased since the onset of the digital age. Nearly all professions around the world involve computer use and even the simplest tasks are carried out via electronic equipment. Hence, it is important for students to learn how to use technology correctly for their future careers. Electronic devices also offer various learning advantages, as notes and assignments can be completed much faster and more neatly using these tools.Nonetheless, the practical skills such as using and holding a pen correctly are likewise vital for future careers. For that reason, students have to be taught at early ages how to carry out simple tasks using basic skills, such as writing. It is also essential that a student develops neat handwriting, as in the case of a technological problem the student will have to write by hand. Furthermore, final exams are typically written by hand and thus the student must develop the basic skill of holding a pen and writing with it. Mathematics skills are no different. People will not always have a device with them to carry out calculations and the ability to do arithmetic in the head is a vital skill for operating in today’s world.In conclusion, I personally believe that schools should keep a balance between using practical skills and using electronic equipment to carry out certain tasks by having student submit assignments created electronically, yet also by having them complete assignments by hand in class and without computers or calculators. This balance is important, as if the focus lies only on one of the two aspects, the student will face problems later on in life.;The rapid advancement of technology has led to a significant increase in computer use worldwide. This phenomenon has not only transformed the way we live and work but has also permeated the education sector. As a result, technological equipment is being increasingly integrated into schools, raising questions about the relevance of traditional skills such as handwriting and mental mathematics.In recent years, the proliferation of computers and digital tools in educational institutions has been remarkable. Many schools now rely heavily on technology to facilitate learning, with students using laptops, tablets, and other devices to access information, complete assignments, and engage with coursework. While this shift towards technology-based learning has numerous benefits, including enhanced accessibility and efficiency, it has also sparked debates about the importance of teaching basic handwriting skills and mental mathematics.Some argue that with the ubiquity of digital tools, the need to teach handwriting and mental math is diminishing. They contend that students can easily rely on spell-checkers, calculators, and other digital aids to perform tasks that were once the exclusive domain of manual skills. However, this perspective overlooks the fundamental value of these traditional skills. Handwriting, for instance, is not only a means of communication but also a cognitive tool that enhances learning and memory retention. Similarly, mental mathematics fosters problem-solving skills, logical reasoning, and a deeper understanding of numerical relationships.In conclusion, while the increasing use of technology in schools is undeniable, it is crucial that schools continue to emphasize the teaching of basic handwriting skills and mental mathematics. These skills are foundational, providing students with a solid educational base that complements digital literacy. By striking a balance between traditional and technological skills, schools can ensure that students are well-rounded, adaptable, and equipped with the skills necessary to thrive in an increasingly digital world.
1303;With the scale of globalisation today, it would be of unquestioned benefit to have a single world currency.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Globalisation has become a significant aspect of the world’s modern economy, with countless industries and businesses expanding in various countries. This has led to the debate of developing a world currency with many people believing it could drastically help further develop economies and assist in the development of many countries.A worldwide currency could bring on effects similar to when Euro was developed for Europe. Trade could be significantly encouraged, as there would be no exchange rate fluctuation risks between different currencies. Moreover, tourists would not need to exchange money when travelling.However, there are certain risks to a global currency, which definitely do not make it an “unquestioned benefit”. Countries in debt would not be able to lower their currency value to make consumer goods more desirable, which could develop into a severe economic issue. For example, the US regulated its interest rates to increase the money resources in order to diminish the effect of a recent recession. Also economic problems, such as in Greece, have actually been made worse by the use of the common Euro. If applied worldwide, many countries’ economies could be very similarly negatively impacted. Finally, many countries around the world do not have a stable enough economy to be able to enter a common currency. If weaker countries were to adopt a world currency, this could be disastrous to their economy and to the economies of other countries using the same currency.In conclusion, the extent to which a global currency would be beneficial is quite low. It seems to me that the risks outweigh the benefits, as if a country were to lose economic stability, the world would be impacted as well. For that reason, I feel that in present circumstances, it is best to have separate currencies to protect countries from economic recession.;"The phenomenon of globalization has sparked a heated debate about the possibility of introducing a world currency. Proponents of this idea argue that a single global currency would facilitate international trade, increase economic efficiency, and reduce transaction costs. The introduction of the Euro in the European Union is often cited as a successful example of a regional currency, which has promoted economic integration and stability among its member states.However, a worldwide currency could bring about similar effects, both positive and negative, as those experienced with the Euro. On the one hand, a global currency would eliminate exchange rate risks and fluctuations, making international trade and investment more predictable and attractive. On the other hand, it would also limit the ability of countries to implement independent monetary policies, which could lead to economic instability and vulnerability to external shocks.Moreover, there are significant risks associated with a global currency that cannot be overlooked. One of the major concerns is that countries with high levels of debt would no longer be able to devalue their currency to make their consumer goods more competitive in the global market. This would severely limit their ability to respond to economic crises and could exacerbate their debt problems. Additionally, a global currency would require a high degree of coordination and cooperation among countries, which is often difficult to achieve, especially in times of economic stress.In conclusion, while a worldwide currency may offer some benefits, it is not an ""unquestioned benefit"" as it poses significant risks and challenges, particularly for countries with high debt levels. The introduction of a global currency would require careful consideration of its potential consequences and a thorough evaluation of its advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, the decision to adopt a global currency should be based on a thorough analysis of its potential impact on the global economy and the ability of countries to respond to economic challenges."
1295;With the vast increase in online resources today, libraries with print books are not a necessity for today’s society.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is indeed true that digital resources today far outstrip what can be put and stored in print books. Almost any kind of book can now be accessed digitally and those that can’t be will soon be changed to a digital format. Some people, therefore, believe that libraries with print books are no longer needed.If one looks at this issue dispassionately, it seems far more logical that people now should only read books digitally. It only requires a single computer or electronic reader and an individual can have access to the history of literature and works on all other fields. The costs involved with setting, typing, printing and distributing print books would practically disappear and this would make things more convenient and much cheaper. An actual library building would be totally unnecessary, as all one would need would be a ‘virtual library’ as a website and all works could be accessed through this portal. There would not even be any need to leave the house to gain access to anything one needed. This would seem to be the most logical way of proceeding.Logic, however, is not always the best approach to everything. Print books have a long history with humanity and our relationship with real books is not something that can be changed overnight. Many people, including younger readers, feel that there is something special about having a book with real paper and needing to turn pages. There will therefore for the time being be a future for print books and libraries.Libraries will continue to be especially important, as not all older people use computers and e-readers as much as the younger generation. They will still want to read print books and the library is a cheap and convenient place to find them. In addition, if only a few books in print are available in the future, libraries might be one of the few places where they might be accessed. Another purpose that libraries serve is acting as community centres that organise events, education and childcare. Ironically, libraries also provide computers and Internet access for people who cannot afford their own.In spite of the seeming dominance to come of digital books, I feel that there is and will be a place for libraries with print books. This state of affairs might change in the future, but at present, they are important community resources.;The advent of digital technology has revolutionized the way we access information, with digital resources now surpassing the capacity of print books. With the click of a button, almost any type of book can be accessed digitally, and those that are not yet available online will soon be converted to a digital format. This has led some to believe that libraries with print books are no longer necessary.Proponents of this view argue that digital libraries offer unparalleled convenience and accessibility. With digital resources, users can access a vast array of books and information from anywhere in the world, at any time. This is particularly beneficial for remote or underprivileged communities that may not have had access to physical libraries. Moreover, digital resources are often more cost-effective and space-efficient, as they eliminate the need for physical storage and maintenance.However, the idea that libraries with print books are no longer needed is a misguided one. While digital resources are undoubtedly valuable, they cannot replace the unique experience and benefits of physical libraries. Print books offer a tactile and immersive experience that many readers still prefer. Moreover, libraries are not just repositories of books, but also community hubs that provide a range of services, including literacy programs, author readings, and other cultural events.Furthermore, not all users have equal access to digital technology, and many may prefer or require the physicality of print books. Therefore, rather than replacing physical libraries, digital resources should be seen as a complement to traditional libraries, offering users a range of options to access information and engage with their community. By embracing both digital and print resources, libraries can continue to play a vital role in promoting literacy, education, and community engagement.
1392;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Capital punishment is always associated with ignorance and intolerance. In fact, we must acknowledge that some people disagree with this kind of penalty, but others vote in its favor. Portugal was the first European country to end this kind of penalty. Since the 19th century, tolerance and respect for life important values. Moreover, we can affirm that remains under the same codes. Maybe because of a religious view point, the respect for life is a typical value in the Old Catholic world.Those who are in favor of capital punishment mostly live in developing countries. However, this is not just an image of the Third World countries. Actually, the USA is one country where this kind of punishment has its rates of application. The state of Texas, in particular, is at the top, supporting this measure against crime, especially those involving serial killers and crimes against children. In a society dominated by fear and government control, it is foreseen that this penalty will continue .Maybe this is not a simple question. As we can see there are several values here and of course cultural behavior. The roots of the question are religious, cultural, ethical and even geographical. The world is divided and the law systems show this division. The solutions, however can lead us to other questions concerning revenge and justice. better to kill a person because of his crimes? Can we admit that a life sentence could be a much better sentence? In fact, rehabilitation is the right way especially with an accurate psychological evaluation first. Some people are lost forever, and in my opinion some murderers and other criminals will suffer more in jail. In this sense, capital punishment is an easy way out.;The debate surrounding capital punishment has long been a contentious issue, with proponents arguing that it serves as a deterrent to crime, while opponents claim that it is a cruel and inhumane practice. However, it is interesting to note that capital punishment is often associated with ignorance and intolerance. Those who are in favor of this measure tend to reside in developing countries, where access to education and information may be limited.In fact, the United States is one of the few developed countries that still practices capital punishment, with the state of Texas being a notable example. Texas has executed the highest number of inmates, with many arguing that this is a reflection of the state's conservative and traditional values. The fact that Texas is at the top of the list in supporting capital punishment against crime suggests that there may be a correlation between cultural attitudes and the acceptance of this practice.Moreover, the association between capital punishment and ignorance is not coincidental. In many developing countries, the lack of access to education and information can lead to a lack of understanding and empathy for those who commit crimes. This can result in a greater willingness to support punitive measures, such as capital punishment, rather than seeking to address the root causes of crime. In contrast, countries with higher levels of education and socioeconomic development tend to reject capital punishment, opting instead for more rehabilitative and restorative approaches to justice.In conclusion, the association between capital punishment and ignorance is a complex issue that highlights the need for greater education and awareness. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, it is imperative that we work towards a more informed and tolerant society, one that rejects punitive measures like capital punishment and instead seeks to address the root causes of crime. By doing so, we can create a more just and equitable world, where human rights are respected and valued.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Serious crimes need capital punishment so that the are unable to get involved in the crime in the future. However, they want to stop the acts of violation in the future then it would be better to .Overall, I agree with the fact that punishment is the way to avoid the and hence our lives become more secure. If the wrongdoer wants to be a good and there is a particular financial or personal problem that led him to the wrong way, then it would be the nice option to forgive him and try to solve the problem he . Although by this way, some bad may become effective of the society but some do not bring themselves to the right path because they are . The person that involved in the crime and never to stop the law-breaking act should be punished in extremely serious way. However, it totally depends on the nature of crime. Some to a capital punishment and some may require a small penalty. The law-making institutions are responsible to bring the bad man to the right level of punishment that he deserves. If there is weak legislation to properly handle the offender, it may for the good . The government should be the responsible authority to provide a secure and better state to live. Laws should be implemented and executed in the most proper way that not allow the offender to commit violent acts or to break the law in any way and to any extent. To sum up, it is the responsibility of the state to stop people involved in crime. It may be done through solving the problems of the people that led them to commit that act or by the punishment accordingly.Where are the paragraphs? This is a good essay; however there are many small mistakes that might cost you dearly. There are also several unclear expressions and grammatical errors.";The concept of punishment for law-breakers has been a long-standing debate in the realm of justice. It is widely accepted that individuals who commit crimes and show no remorse or intention to cease their illicit activities should face severe consequences. In fact, the severity of the punishment should be commensurate with the gravity of the offense. For instance, certain heinous crimes may warrant capital punishment, as they pose a significant threat to the well-being and safety of society. On the other hand, less severe offenses may require less stringent penalties, such as fines or community service.The primary objective of punishment is to deter potential offenders and to protect the general public from harm. Therefore, it is imperative that the government takes a proactive role in ensuring that the laws are enforced and that those who break them are held accountable. As the responsible authority, the government has a duty to provide a secure and better state for its citizens to live in. This entails creating and implementing effective laws, as well as establishing a fair and just system for punishing offenders.Ultimately, the severity of the punishment should reflect the severity of the crime. Those who persist in their law-breaking activities, showing a blatant disregard for the law and the well-being of others, should face the most extreme punishments. By doing so, the government can maintain order, send a strong message to potential offenders, and provide a safe and stable environment for its citizens. In conclusion, punishment is a necessary aspect of maintaining a just and secure society, and it is the government's responsibility to ensure that those who break the law are held accountable and face the appropriate consequences.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people claim that language knowledge has still benefited inspite of appearance of applications and websites providing translation in real time. Modern special software is able to give quite quality translation into different languages, and it seems that it will soon replace the translators and will get rid of necessity to learn new languages. However, in my opinion, there are still some essential advantages to know foreign languages.First of all, any language is so complicated and constantly changing system that it is impossible to automized translation process to keep all senses. For instance, if you interlocutor creates a joke based on words game, it will unlikely recognise by AI. Thus, it is too hard to teach a computer to uderstand all meanings that you want to provide.Another important aspect of learning languages is knowing new cultures. Language is the great source for understanding other nations and countries. If you use online translator, you will never know the origine of some idioms or phrases that contain culture code.Moreover, learning new language is a tool of training your brain. It helps to develop memory and imagination. For instance, people didn't refuse studying maths after calculation device had been invented, because it is still important to understand how it works and it is necessary for developing other sciences.Finally, there is a lot of places and occasions when you do not have internet access. Then online translators are not available. But if you need help or ask a path being abroad, it is better to know at least some phrases. Otherwise, you can occur in unpleasant situation.To sum up, I definitely agree the statement that learning languages is essential in spite of techology progress. Although artificial intelligence is able to translate everything you want, it is crucial to continue learning languages in order to understand all sense and meanings in conversation with foreigners, to know new cultures and understand their peculiarities and, of course, to make your brain work.;"The advent of real-time translation applications and websites has led some to believe that the importance of language knowledge has diminished. However, I strongly disagree with this notion. Despite the convenience offered by these technological advancements,,assistant,I must disagree, there are still numerous benefits to acquiring foreign language skills. Firstly, languages are intricate and constantly evolving systems, making it impossible for automated translation processes to capture all the nuances and complexities of human communication. The subtleties of idioms, colloquialisms, and context-dependent expressions often get lost in translation, highlighting the limitations of relying solely on technology for language understanding.Furthermore, learning a foreign language is not just about communicating; it is also about immersing oneself in a new culture. Knowing a language allows one to appreciate the literature, history, and customs of the respective country, fostering a deeper understanding and respect for diverse cultural practices. This cultural awareness is essential in today's globalized world, where international relations, business, and cooperation are increasingly important. By studying a foreign language, one gains a unique perspective on the world, enabling more effective communication and collaboration across cultural boundaries.In conclusion, while real-time translation tools are undoubtedly useful, the benefits of language knowledge extend far beyond mere communication. The complexities of language and the cultural insights gained through language acquisition make learning a foreign language an invaluable skill. As we move forward in an increasingly interconnected world, the importance of language knowledge will only continue to grow, underscoring the need for individuals to embrace language learning as a means to bridge cultural divides and foster global understanding."

Why are more people choosing to have operation to change the way they look? Do you think this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;A greater number of individuals opted for plastic surgery to enhance the physical outlook. What could be the reason behind the increasing number of people opting for cosmetic surgery to deter their appearance.In my opinion the main reason why cosmetic surgery is in demand nowadays is because society has set a certain standard that physical appearance will be the fastest ticket to stand out in the crowd. Second is it boosts confidence to people with low self esteem.The favorable outcome is not as much the adverse effect to the individuals. Example, the fastest way to reduce wrinkles on the face is to get Botox treatment. It lasts 3-4 months, after that it needs continuous medication to maintain what has been changed. It takes a lot of money to satisfy the demands of the society. On top of that repetition of pain and recovery during and after the surgery.There are numerous natural ways to enhance beauty and confidence. Contentment, exercise and a healthy lifestyle are effective methods to maintain the genuine beauty of the people. Simple walking in the morning, keeping the distance from negativity and eating vegetables and fruits are the simplest methods that boost the natural glow of the body and prevent us from being sick.To conclude the essay, I think plastic surgery is not necessary to enhance physical outlook as it uses synthetic components that have harmful effects within the body.;The Rise of Plastic Surgery: A Societal PressureIn today's world, plastic surgery has become increasingly in demand. This trend can be attributed to the societal standard that physical appearance is the key to standing out in the crowd. People feel pressured to conform to certain beauty norms, which has led to a surge in individuals opting for surgical procedures to enhance their looks. However, the favorable outcomes of plastic surgery are far outweighed by its adverse effects on individuals.The constant bombardment of airbrushed models and celebrities in the media has created unrealistic beauty standards, leading people to believe that they need to undergo surgery to be considered beautiful. This not only affects self-esteem but also leads to a multitude of physical and emotional complications. The risks associated with plastic surgery, such as scarring, infection, and even death, are often overlooked in the pursuit of physical perfection.Moreover, the emphasis on plastic surgery has distracted people from the numerous natural ways to enhance beauty and confidence. A healthy diet, exercise, and self-care routines can work wonders in boosting self-esteem and physical appearance. Additionally, practices like meditation and yoga can help individuals develop a positive body image and inner confidence, rendering the need for surgical intervention unnecessary. It is essential to recognize and promote these natural methods, rather than relying on surgery as a quick fix.In conclusion, while plastic surgery may seem like a solution to societal pressure, its risks and adverse effects far outweigh its benefits. It is crucial to shift our focus towards embracing natural beauty and self-acceptance, rather than trying to conform to unrealistic standards. By doing so, we can promote a healthier and more positive body image, where individuals can thrive without the need for surgical enhancement.

What solutions can you suggest?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Most children are facing one form of bullying or the other in our schools on daily basis world wide. It is becoming a serious problem and there is a need to solve this. In this essay, we would be considering two causes and possible ways to solve these.First of all, the rate at which children bullying each other in the school environment is rising. One major cause is that bullying breeds bullying, children who are faced with physical, mental and emotional abuse from homes tend to transfer their fustrations on their peers. They think that is how one is supposed to live, exacting authority to gain superiority on weaker peers in school. Another is children who has low self esteem, such students feels threatened over their classmates they taught to be more intelligent or having better physical appearance than them.Although, there are several causes of bullying, teachers should be taught how to identify children who are from abusive homes and inform the appropriate authority. These students would taken away from such toxic environment early and they would be sent for some pschological therapy. Meanwhile, education is also a key factor especially for children who have low self esteem. This should be done by forms such as role plays, presentation and drama, where these students are taught how to have self love and accepting what they can not change on their self.In conclusion, children from abusive homes and those who have low self esteem are some of the reasons for bullying. I recommend that early identification of abusive children and education is some of the ways we can solve these problems.;The scourge of bullying has become a pervasive and persistent problem in schools worldwide, affecting countless children on a daily basis. This disturbing trend has significant consequences for the emotional, psychological, and social well-being of young people, making it an urgent issue that demands attention and action. In this essay, we will examine two primary causes of bullying in schools and explore potential solutions to address this complex problem.One of the main causes of bullying is the lack of effective supervision and monitoring in schools. When teachers and administrators fail to maintain a vigilant presence, bullies are emboldened to engage in aggressive behavior, often targeting vulnerable students. Another significant cause is the cultural and social norms that perpetuate aggression and violence. When bullying is tolerated or even encouraged, either explicitly or implicitly, it creates a toxic environment that allows bullies to thrive.To combat bullying, schools must adopt a multi-faceted approach. Firstly, schools should implement rigorous supervision and monitoring policies, ensuring that teachers and staff are proactive in identifying and addressing incidents of bullying. This can include training programs for educators, as well as the establishment of anonymous reporting systems, which empower students to report incidents without fear of reprisal. Secondly, schools should promote a culture of empathy, inclusivity, and respect, through education and awareness campaigns that challenge harmful social norms and encourage positive relationships among students. By addressing these underlying causes and implementing effective solutions, we can create safer, more supportive learning environments, where all students can thrive and reach their full potential. Ultimately, it is our collective responsibility to protect children from the harm of bullying and ensure that schools are havens of safety, inclusivity, and respect.

For many, it is a fun and enjoyable experience, where they can browse through various products and services from the comfort of their own homes. Others, however, resort to online shopping due to their busy schedules, which leave them with little time to visit department stores. The convenience and flexibility that online shopping offers have made it a staple of modern life.However, despite its numerous advantages, online shopping also has its fair share of disadvantages. One of the most significant drawbacks is the risk of order delays. After placing an order, customers often have to wait for an extended period before receiving their purchases. This can be frustrating, especially when the item is needed urgently. Furthermore, online shopping can be plagued by issues of timing. Sometimes, orders arrive at the wrong time, such as when the customer is not at home to receive the delivery. This can lead to additional complications, such as having to collect the package from a post office or arranging for re-delivery.In conclusion, while online shopping offers a convenient and enjoyable shopping experience, it is not without its flaws. The potential for order delays and timing issues can detract from the overall experience. Nevertheless, with the continued advancement of technology and improvements in logistics, these issues are being addressed. As online shopping continues to evolve, it is likely that the disadvantages will decrease, making it an even more attractive option for those who enjoy shopping from the comfort of their own homes or for those who simply do not have the time to visit physical stores.
515;Write about the following topic.Cohabitation is believed to bring huge advantages for young people since it enables them to fully understand each other before deciding to get married.Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many people believe it may be advisable for couples to live together before getting married, as it may lead to a smoother relationship after they have married.I tend to agree with such opinions, as I find the arguments that usually support them to be quite reasonable. For example, it is commonly said that people act differently when they are at home and when they are outside. People instinctively tend to be more relaxed and off-guard when at home, whereas in social situations they usually make an effort, even if unconsciously, to be more likable and to conceal the less agreeable aspects of their personality from others, even their partners. Because of this, it is usual to hear that one does not truly know someone until one has lived with that person.In extreme cases, cohabitation before marriage could even prevent couples from entering into a marriage that is bound to fail and will lead to unhappiness. Considering this possibility seems reasonable, as marriage is not only an emotional bond, but also a legal one, and undoing it is usually upsetting, time-consuming and costly.Another reason I find cohabitation before marriage to be a sensible choice is that, as minor disagreements and conflicts are usually inevitable during the first months of cohabitation, it is preferable to pass through that stage before getting married than to add such problems to a period which in itself can already be stressful, such as the few weeks before the ceremony and the weeks following.What I have said up to this point reflects my opinion, but it must be noted I did not put any of it into practice when I got married. Indeed, my wife and I decided to move in together only a few weeks before the ceremony. This decision was due to the fact that her family is quite old-fashioned, and moving in together before would undoubtedly have caused them pain, even if we had our reasons for doing so and they would have understood them. No degree of persuasion would have avoided or removed such pain. We found the long-term benefits of a stable and close relationship with her family to be more important than the discomfort of not moving in together, and we ultimately decided to do it only once the ceremony was planned.;The decision to cohabitate before marriage has been a topic of discussion for many years. While some view it as a negative trend, it can actually have numerous benefits for couples. One of the most significant advantages of cohabitation before marriage is that it could even prevent couples from entering into a marriage that is bound to fail. By living together, couples can gauge their compatibility and identify potential issues before making a long-term commitment.Minor disagreements and conflicts are usually inevitable during the first months of cohabitation. These disagreements can range from simple issues such as household chores to more complex problems like financial management. However, it is precisely this stage of testing and learning that can help couples determine whether they are truly compatible. It is preferable to pass through that stage before getting married than to add such problems to a period which in itself can be stressful. The first year of marriage is often filled with adjustments and challenges, and adding unresolved issues from cohabitation can put a strain on the relationship.In conclusion, cohabitation before marriage can be a wise decision for couples. It allows them to navigate the challenges of living together, work through disagreements, and develop a stronger understanding of each other's needs and expectations. By doing so, couples can build a more stable and resilient relationship, which can ultimately lead to a more successful and fulfilling marriage. Ultimately, cohabitation before marriage can be a valuable investment in the future of the relationship, and one that can help prevent unnecessary stress and heartache down the line.

What measures can be taken to protect them?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;These days, consumers often suffer from the increase of numbers of advertisements conducted by competing companies. I believe that this fact has certain negative effects on consumers' working performance as well as their private space and time. In order to protect consumers, some proposals related to protecting their information and eliminating the number of advertisements are required.The increasing number of advertisements has a negative effect on the consumers. Firstly, their working perfomance can be reduced. Obivously, when a person is working, he cannot receive a large number of advertisements, process and response them. I know a researcher who receives a lot of advertising emails from certain banksand even some scientific journal while he require time to perform many research projects. This makes him feel uncomfortable when working, thereby reducing the research's quality. Secondly, the advertisements can affect on people private space and time. For examle, when they spend time on their family after a hard working day, or even when they are sleeping. This completyly affects on the consumers, in terms of both physical and mental health.For protecting consumers, certain methods need to be proposed. Firstly, it can be implied that the consumers' information is illegal used by many companies. Therefore, an imporvement of security method can allow us to protect consumers. Secondly, eliminating the number of advertisements performed by companies and eliminating the hours for companies send advertisements are required.In conclusion, the increasing numbers of advertisements leads to certain unwanted results for consumers, such as reducing their working performance as well as their private space and time. For protecting consumers, we need to protect their personal information and eliminate the number of advertisements.;The proliferation of advertisements in today's market has become a pressing concern for consumers. With numerous companies vying for attention, the average consumer is bombarded with a relentless stream of ads, making it challenging to discern valuable information from noise. This phenomenon not only infringes upon consumers' personal space but also poses a significant threat to their privacy and decision-making abilities. Therefore, it is imperative to propose measures that protect consumers from the deluge of advertisements and safeguard their personal information.To mitigate the negative impacts of excessive advertising, several proposals can be considered. Firstly, implementing stricter regulations on data collection and usage can help prevent companies from exploiting consumers' personal information for targeted advertising. This can be achieved through legislation that enforces transparency and obtains explicit consent from consumers before their data is used for advertising purposes.Secondly, a cap on the number of advertisements that can be displayed to a consumer within a given timeframe can be introduced. This would prevent the sensory overload that many consumers experience and allow them to make more informed decisions without the influence of manipulative advertising tactics. Furthermore, promoting media literacy among consumers can empower them to critically evaluate the advertisements they are exposed to, recognizing both the overt and subtle messages that are conveyed.Ultimately, protecting consumers from the onslaught of advertisements requires a multi-faceted approach that involves regulatory measures, as well as educational initiatives. By proposing and implementing such methods, we can create a more balanced and transparent advertising environment that respects consumers' rights and promotes ethical business practices. This not only benefits consumers but also fosters a more sustainable and trustworthy market ecosystem.

Some people think that the closure of local business will bring about the death of local communities.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;As the huge company extends their bussiness, the local markets is dimmished to local society. This essay explains why I disagree closure of local business will bring about the death of local communities with relevant examples.First, Big company drag the new residents. I believe major company make the local communities to flourish. My cusion lived in countryside for 30 years. Every time when I visited that place, that farm land still same during the a few decades. However, recently when I dropped by there I surprised with new tall building that newly built. My cusion told me once the big supermarkert open in this neighborhood, grasp many couples or familly to live here. Eventually, that rural place's population is surged.Someone thought giant grocery's product cheap price can not compete with local product, that make local place to close. I considered it is anachromism idea. Now the customer's purchasing value is totally diffrent with previous eras. Buyer start choose organic product and eco-friendlly or morality brand. If local stores have their own unique products, which are not replace with other, such as handmade cheese and unique taste of bread, local bussiness can compete with global chain markets.In conclusion, albeit famous company expands their sites every moments, the local community can be larger by new residents settled down near local region. Also, local bussiness have specialty, community can not dismissed;The expansion of huge companies into local markets has led to the diminishment of local businesses, and subsequently, the erosion of local communities. However, I strongly disagree with the notion that the closure of local businesses will inevitably bring about the death of local communities. While it is true that the presence of large corporations can lead to the decline of small, family-owned businesses, I believe that local communities have the resilience and adaptability to survive and even thrive in the face of such challenges.For instance, in many small towns, the closure of local shops has led to a surge in community-led initiatives, such as farmers' markets, craft fairs, and cooperative stores. These initiatives not only provide alternative platforms for local producers to sell their goods but also foster a sense of community and social connection among residents. Furthermore, the absence of large corporations can lead to a resurgence in community-based innovation, as local entrepreneurs are forced to think creatively and develop unique solutions to meet the needs of their community.Moreover, the demise of local businesses can also lead to a renewed focus on community-based services, such as local healthcare, education, and social services. For example, in some towns, the closure of large supermarket chains has led to the establishment of community-supported agriculture programs, where residents can purchase fresh produce directly from local farmers. Such initiatives not only promote local economic development but also enhance the overall well-being and quality of life of community members. In conclusion, while the expansion of huge companies may pose significant challenges to local businesses, I firmly believe that local communities have the capacity to adapt, innovate, and thrive in the face of such challenges, and that the closure of local businesses will not necessarily bring about the death of local communities.

Anyway, a lot of people think that this types of sports are very dangerous and should be banned. This essay will talk about extreme sports giving my own opinion about the idea of banning this activities because of their risks.Practicing a sport is very important for the general health of a person; a lot of people choose to practice dangerous sports, like skiing, because of the adrenaline and the sensation that it brings to you. Sports of this type can help you to go over your fear and they will help you to see life from a different perspective.Anyway, the risks that an athlete will go through are many; every year the amount of people that have injuries or, sometimes die, because of this types of activities are numerous. Especially with skiing, a person should never go alone in places that don't have the right equipment to guarantee a safe experience; many times when practicing this types of sports, athletes from all over the world decide to go over their limit going to practice in zones that are known to be dangerous or unsafe and, in this cases, the possibility of something bad to happen is high.Personally, I think that when you want to practice or experiment a sport that is extreme you should take all the right prevention to make the experience as safe as possible to avoid any injuries. Practicing sports is important but it is also fundamental to try your best to avoid injuries when practicing it. This essay talked about extreme sports and their risk, giving my own opinion at the end.";The notion of banning extreme sports, such as sky diving and skiing, has sparked a heated debate among enthusiasts and critics alike. Many people believe that these activities are inherently dangerous and should be prohibited to prevent injuries and fatalities. However, I strongly disagree with this perspective.While it is true that extreme sports carry a level of risk, I believe that this is a fundamental aspect of their appeal. Participants in these sports are aware of the potential dangers and take necessary precautions to minimize them. Moreover, the thrill and adrenaline rush that come with extreme sports are unparalleled, and the sense of accomplishment and personal growth that participants experience are invaluable.Furthermore, banning extreme sports would be an overreach of authority and an infringement on personal freedom. Adults should be allowed to make their own choices about the activities they participate in, as long as they are not harming others. Additionally, the economic benefits of extreme sports, such as tourism and equipment sales, should not be overlooked.It is also worth noting that many extreme sports have robust safety protocols in place, and the risk of injury or death is relatively low when participants follow proper procedures and guidelines. For example, in sky diving, the use of specialized equipment and instruction from certified professionals greatly reduces the risk of accident.In conclusion, while extreme sports do carry risks, I firmly believe that they should not be banned. The benefits of participation, including personal growth, thrill, and economic benefits, outweigh the potential dangers. With proper safety protocols and precautions in place, individuals should be free to make their own choices about participating in these activities. By allowing extreme sports to continue, we promote a culture of adventure, resilience, and personal responsibility.

Personally, I think there are some good advantages team activities cause our life,and especially in business scenes more comfortable and productive.Initially, only one person's work is limited, compared with group activities. This means that working only one person will be able to cause some profits to some extent. On the other hand, group working will be more productive and efficient to make more sales figures. In addition, each person has a great ability. For example, some people have great communication skills and negotiations. Those people arethe most appropriate roles for sales. Furthermore, some people are good at analysing the group performance quality and making strategies. Those who are good at these activities are best for marketing team. As a result, they can focus on their strong points for work and they can divide and conquer the tasks with each other.Of course, some people are eager to work alone at their own relaxed pace and make a profit to some extent. This is less stressful they do not need to keep attention from other colleagues. But this means that they need to decide all tasks and take all responsibility. Sometimes it might be risky once they made a mistake and caused a huge deficit.Finally, there is no doubt that more than two heads are better than one. People can share their experiences and opinion to improve their group activities. If some people who are sensitive and feel pressure if some people meddle in too much. It is necessary to organize some rules that must be effective. For example, all people need to try to stay positive, avoid stating negative or swear words, and not deny one person's opinion straightforwardly and emotionally. Making a great atmosphere, saying positive words with each other, and including some humor, will lead to everyone's performance being more productive.;The concept that group work can be more beneficial for people's lives is widely discussed across the globe.

When individuals work together towards a common goal, they bring their unique skills, experiences, and perspectives to the table. This diversity of thought and expertise can lead to innovative solutions and better decision-making.One of the primary advantages of group work is that it fosters communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills. When people collaborate, they learn to express their ideas, listen to others, and build on each other's strengths. This not only enhances their interpersonal skills but also promotes a sense of camaraderie and shared responsibility. Moreover, group work encourages creativity, as individuals are exposed to different viewpoints and approaches, which can stimulate new ideas and approaches.In the business world, group work is particularly valuable. Companies that adopt a team-based approach often experience improved productivity, increased employee satisfaction, and better customer service. When employees work together, they can share workload, provide mutual support, and celebrate each other's successes. This, in turn, can lead to a more positive and motivated work environment. Furthermore, group work enables businesses to tap into the collective knowledge and expertise of their employees, leading to more informed and effective decision-making.In conclusion, I firmly believe that group work has numerous benefits that can make our lives, especially in business settings, more comfortable and productive. By working together, individuals can develop valuable skills, foster creativity, and achieve common goals. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, the importance of group work will only continue to grow, making it an essential aspect of personal and professional development.
317;Write about the following topic.In many countries large amounts of foods are wasted. Why do you think people waste food in this way? What can be done to reduce the amount of food thrown away?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, many countries are confronted with the increasing amount of waste and one of the major contributions is food wasted by people. This issue is mainly driven by an over-ordered food and misunderstanding about the method of food disposal. However, people could cease from creating food waste through the act of both restaurants and governments.To begin with, it is obvious that countries have wasted because the amount of food that people buy is more than the amount they need. The crucial factor of this behavior is that when people contemplate menus in a restaurant, they tend to order many items in order to satisfy their desire level. Eventually, a lot of food scraps are left when these people finish eating their meals. Another potential cause could be because people do not know how to deal with food scraps. As a result, they might understand that putting wasted food into a garbage is the only solution they could do. This is exemplified by statistics published by Thai waste association which demonstrate that more than a half of waste in Thailand come from household food.A possible solution for this matter could be for restaurants to fine their customers who leave some food. This policy possibly encourages customers to carefully think of the reasonable amount of food when they order. In addition, from the country’s level governments could also educate their citizens including companies in the food-service industry about how to do with food waste due to the fact that some edible items could be food for animals. For instance, authorities could give an instruction demonstrating that dogs can be fed with remaining food such as rice or bread while remaining vegetables can be food for rabbits.In conclusion, people waste food since they order food by what they want without considering the amount and most of them misunderstand about the way to dispose of food waste. Nevertheless, this concern can be coped with the penalty by restaurants as well as the guidance from governments regarding feeding animal with food scraps.;The escalating issue of waste management has become a pressing concern for many countries worldwide. One of the significant contributors to this problem is food waste, which is largely attributed to the actions of individuals. A substantial portion of food waste is generated by people who over-order food at restaurants, resulting in uneaten leftovers. Furthermore, this issue is exacerbated by a lack of understanding about proper food disposal methods. This problem not only leads to unnecessary waste but also has severe environmental and economic implications. The production, transportation, and disposal of food that is ultimately wasted result in a significant waste of resources, including water, energy, and land. Therefore, it is essential to address this issue through effective solutions.One potential solution to mitigate food waste is for restaurants to implement a policy where customers are fined for leaving uneaten food. This approach would encourage people to be more mindful of their food orders and reduce the likelihood of over-ordering. Additionally, governments can play a crucial role in educating citizens about the importance of proper food waste disposal. By launching public awareness campaigns and implementing recycling programs, governments can empower individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to manage food waste responsibly.In conclusion, the issue of food waste is a complex problem that requires a multi-faceted approach. By adopting strategies such as fining customers for uneaten food and promoting education on food waste management, we can work towards reducing the amount of waste generated by food waste. It is crucial for individuals, restaurants, and governments to collaborate and take collective action to address this issue and promote a more sustainable food system.
1025;Write about the following topic.In many countries, a small number of people earn extremely high salaries. Some people believe that this is good for the country, but others think that governments should not allow salaries above a certain level.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In many parts of the world, few people get a lot of money thanks to their job. It is believed by some that this is an advantage for the country, while it is thought by others that governments should put a limit above which salaries cannot be.In my opinion, I believe that not only people have to be rewarded for their performance, but also their wage salary has to be proportional to the benefits that they are leading to the country.For instance, due to the Covid a lot of people suffered several injuries which were cured only thanks to the doctors and the nurses. For this reason, since they are saving lifes everyday,it seems unbelievable the fact that they are earning much less money than football players.Another example can be found in people involved in the national security: I believe that it would be fairer if these professionals were paid more than an influencer.However, in our society this figures (such as doctors) are paid by governments through taxes, while football players or influncers gain incomes by private companies.In order to not impose an heavier taxation, politics should categorise jobs basing on their importance in the society. Hence, we will have a specific amount that these employers can earn.Thus, if these no-fundamental workers (like actors or actress) are earning more money than the precise level chosen, these will be used as funds to increase life-saving jobs' salary.In conclusion, I believe that highest salaries should exist only if we are referring to a job that is needed by everyone.;The Distribution of Wealth: A Call for FairnessIn many parts of the world, a stark reality prevails: a select few reap the lion's share of financial rewards from their professions. This disparity raises fundamental questions about the fairness and equity of our economic systems. In my opinion, the remuneration of individuals should not only reflect their performance but also be commensurate with the benefits they bring to their country. This principle underscores the need for a more balanced approach to compensation, one that values and rewards contributions to society proportionally.Professionals such as doctors, teachers, and engineers, who dedicate their careers to improving the health, education, and infrastructure of their communities, often find themselves at the lower end of the salary spectrum compared to celebrities or social media influencers. This juxtaposition is particularly striking when one considers the tangible, long-term benefits that these professionals bring to society. For instance, a doctor's work directly improves public health, a teacher educates future generations, and an engineer contributes to the development of critical infrastructure.On the other hand, the role of influencers, while impactful in the realm of entertainment and consumer trends, pales in comparison to the societal value added by these professionals. It seems counterintuitive, therefore, that in many cases, influencers are compensated at a level that surpasses that of those in more traditionally valued professions. This disparity not only reflects a skewed sense of priorities but also a flawed reward system.In conclusion, a more equitable distribution of wealth, one that aligns salaries with the societal benefits generated by various professions, is essential for fostering a fair and just society. By recognizing and rewarding the true value of different professions, we can work towards a system where compensation reflects not just individual performance, but the broader impact on the community and the country at large. This shift in perspective is crucial for creating a more balanced and sustainable economic model, one that encourages and supports the professionals who are the backbone of our societies.
233;Write about the following topic.In some parts of the world people try to find out one's own family history. Why do people do this? Do you think it is a positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"At present, discovering one`s own family history is becoming more and more commom. In the following paragraphs, I will present the motives why people do that and the reason I strongly believe this is important and have positive effects on people.Probably the most crucial motive people search for their family`s past is to find out about any chronical diseases. One of society`s biggest concern nowadays is healthy leaving. Therefore, by knowing the family health history and genetic predisposition to a specific disease such as cancer or diabetes, one can prepare and take the appropriate mesures to prevent it or have an early treatment.Moreover, another reason people may seek for their ancestors`s history is to build a sense of belonging. Human beings need to feel welcomed and inserted into a culture; a community`s identity is as important as an individual one, as it provides people with the opportunity to grow and develop relantioships. When people know about their family history, their sense of belonging is promoted, and they can actively participate in their culture and contribute to their community.As mentioned in the previous paragraphs, people search about family history for health and cultural reasons. One and the other do impact positivily a person`s life, as being healthy and part of a community integrate people`s satisfaction about living.To summarize, one may try to find out about their family history for two main motives, one being about their health and the other one about feeling part of a community. Both reasons are important and have positive impacts on one`s life.";The pursuit of uncovering one's family history has become an increasingly popular endeavor in recent years. Discovering one's own family history is becoming more and more common, as individuals seek to learn about their ancestors and the events that shaped their lives. Among the most crucial motives that drive people to search for their family's past is the desire to uncover information about any chronic diseases that may have affected their relatives. By researching their family's medical history, people can gain valuable insights into potential health risks and take proactive steps to mitigate them.Another significant reason people seek out their ancestors' history is to build a sense of belonging. Learning about one's heritage and the experiences of their forebears can foster a deeper connection to their roots and cultural identity. By exploring their family's past, individuals can gain a greater understanding of the traditions, customs, and values that have been passed down through generations. This, in turn, can help people develop a stronger sense of self and a more profound appreciation for the sacrifices and achievements of their ancestors.Moreover, exploring one's family history can also lead to unexpected discoveries and surprises, as individuals uncover hidden stories, forgotten relatives, and previously unknown historical events. As people delve into their family's past, they may stumble upon fascinating tales of migration, hardship, and resilience, which can serve as a source of inspiration and pride. Ultimately, the quest to discover one's family history is a deeply personal and rewarding journey that can lead to a greater understanding of oneself and one's place within the larger narrative of their family's story. As such, it is no wonder that an increasing number of people are embarking on this journey of self-discovery, seeking to unravel the mysteries of their family's past and forge a deeper connection to their heritage.
987;Write about the following topic.Information technology is changing many aspects of our lives and now dominates our home, leisure and work activities.To what extent do the benefits of information technology outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;There is no doubt that these days information technology has invaded our space and dominated our home leisure and work. However, the question: is dominating our lives by this technology have a negative or positive impact on our lives? Is considered one of the most controversial issues today. In this essay, I am going to examine this phenomenon from both viewpoints.On one side of the argument, some people argue that the benefits considerably outweigh the disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is integrating technology in every aspect eases our lives and decreases hardworking. For example, advanced houses with integrated voice commands give the person the ability to achieve multiple tasks without any physical activity. Moreover, the technology allows people to connect multiple devices with an email address and control them remotely. One good illustration of that you can switch on and off your home AC while you are at work by the WIFI technology.On the other hand, it is also possible to consider it with the opposing case. It is often argued that in fact using advanced technology increase the number of unhealthy people. People often have this opinion because people become lazier, and their daily activity dramatically decreases making them prone to diseases.As we have seen, there are no easy answers to this question. On balance, however, I tend to believe that using advanced information technology should be limited to simple tasks, so at any point if a technical error happened you can resume your life without any obstacles.;The advent of information technology has revolutionized the way we live, work, and leisure. It has invaded our personal space, dominating our homes, as well as our workplaces. The question of whether this domination has a negative or positive impact on our lives is a highly debated topic in today's society. The controversy surrounding this issue stems from the varying opinions on the benefits and drawbacks of technology's pervasive presence.On one hand, some people argue that the benefits of information technology far outweigh the disadvantages. They contend that technology has made our lives more efficient, convenient, and interconnected. With just a click of a button, we can access vast amounts of information, communicate with people worldwide, and perform tasks with unprecedented speed and accuracy. Moreover, technology has opened up new avenues for entertainment, education, and economic opportunities, thereby enhancing our overall quality of life.On the other hand, there are those who caution against the unbridled adoption of technology, citing concerns about its potential negative impacts. They argue that excessive reliance on technology can lead to social isolation, decreased attention span, and a decline in face-to-face communication skills. Furthermore, the constant stream of information can be overwhelming, leading to increased stress levels and decreased productivity. However, proponents of technology argue that these drawbacks can be mitigated by responsible and balanced use of technology.In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the potential negative impacts of information technology, the benefits of this technology are undeniable. By embracing technology in a thoughtful and measured way, we can harness its power to improve our lives, without sacrificing our well-being or humanity. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to ensure that technology serves as a tool to enhance, rather than control, our lives.
1033;Write about the following topic.It is inevitable that traditional cultures will be lost as technology develops. Technology and traditional cultures are incompatible.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many people hold the view that traditional culture and technological development cannot coexist as the latter catch on, the former will be bound to disappear. I totally disagree with this because both can be implemented jointly by putting technology at the service of tradition and through pilot projects.To begin with, technological progress, which is making major strides in our daily lives, is the means by which local mores, custom and traditions could be brought back to life, proving they are compatible. In fact, by tapping technology to make tradition far more attractive, considerably more audience will be engaged into such activities. Bologna is a case in point, since, thanks to digital machines and drones which have supported housewives into the making of , the traditional celebration of “making pasta day ” has recently being turned into a successful events, which draws people from country as far afield as China.Another example of possible coexistence is the possibility to heighten awareness of people costumes through the creation of pilot projects which bring both habits and technology to a new whole level. This can be put into practice by setting a direct connection to cultural heritage of a specific area of the world to those who do not have access easily. To this end, many primary schools in New York have developed a project in which, owing to the ultimate high speed connection, pupils who come from abroad can learn ancient craft directly from a master located in their country of origin.To conclude, I firmly believe that traditional culture and technology development are widely compatible as the technology can positively beef up the presence of cultural traditions nowadays, so as to keep its memory Alive. In addition, pioneering projects can be implemented to underpin cultural awareness amongst youngsters.;The notion that traditional culture and technological development are mutually exclusive has become a widespread belief. Many people hold the view that as technology advances, the former will inevitably disappear. However, I strongly disagree with this perspective. In my opinion, traditional culture and technological development can not only coexist but also complement each other.By putting technology at the service of tradition, the two can be harmoniously integrated. For instance, technology can be used to preserve and promote traditional cultural heritage, such as digitizing ancient artifacts, creating virtual museums, and developing cultural databases. This approach allows for the preservation of cultural traditions while making them more accessible to a wider audience.Moreover, pilot projects can be implemented to test the feasibility of combining traditional culture with technological development. These projects can help identify areas where technology can enhance traditional practices without compromising their authenticity. For example, technology can be used to improve traditional craftsmanship, such as using 3D printing to create traditional handicrafts, or utilizing digital platforms to promote traditional music and art.In conclusion, the idea that traditional culture and technological development cannot coexist is a misconception. By leveraging technology to support and enhance traditional culture, we can ensure the preservation and promotion of our cultural heritage. Through pilot projects and innovative approaches, we can successfully implement both traditional culture and technological development jointly, creating a unique blend that showcases the best of both worlds. Ultimately, this integration will not only preserve our cultural traditions but also pave the way for a more inclusive and diverse future.
1117;Write about the following topic.It is now possible for scientists and tourists to travel to remote natural environment, such as the South Pole.What are advantages and disadvantages of this development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Thanks to the development of our society, individuals can now travel to isolated areas, namely the South Pole. Never has this area been exploded before so researchers could discover crucial information for thesis and tourists could appreciate a fabulous landscape. However, discovering those faraway environments could increase environment-related issues such as climatic change.South Pole is a place which has ever seen human activities before, and it seems to have numerous discoveries to make. Indeed, scientists which fauna and flora are the current studies, could find new mode of the marine life and discover new species. Moreover, people who are interested in travelling to South Pole might now do it, children who dreamed about polar animals could see them. Thus, the tourism should create new jobs and develop economic growth.Nevertheless, as each breakthrough that the society does, there are repercussions. In this case, the harmful effect of this discovery is global warming because when humans go somewhere, they let a carbon footprint which directly changes the environment. For instance, if individuals had to travel to South Pole, they would only use air or marine transport such as cruise ship which pollute the area with greenhouse gases. As a result, those greenhouse gases can warm nature which, unfortunately, would melt the ice and have a detrimental impact on the landscapes. As a consequence, in the forthcoming decades, this panorama may disappear. Thereby, if scientists want to study this natural area, they could not or in a limited way.To conclude, the advantages could be to discover new landscapes and how species can live in this hostile area. However, just going into this remote natural environment could destroy it before discovering something.;I must correct the initial statement - the South Pole is not a place that has never seen human activities before. In fact, it has been explored and researched by numerous expeditions and scientists over the years. Despite this, the South Pole and its surrounding oceans remain a vast and relatively unexplored region, offering a unique opportunity for scientific discovery.The Antarctic waters are home to a diverse range of marine life, and scientists believe that there are still many new species and modes of marine life to be discovered. The extreme and isolated environment of the South Pole creates a unique ecosystem that is adapted to the harsh conditions, and studying this ecosystem can provide valuable insights into the evolution and adaptation of life on Earth. By exploring this region, scientists may uncover new species, as well as new modes of marine life that have never been seen before.However, as with each breakthrough that society makes, there are often repercussions to consider. The discovery of new species and ecosystems can lead to concerns about the impact of human activity on these fragile environments. The introduction of non-native species, pollution, and climate change can all have devastating effects on the delicate balance of the Antarctic ecosystem. Furthermore, the increased interest in exploring and researching the South Pole can lead to a rise in human activity, which can result in habitat destruction, disturbance of wildlife, and other negative consequences.In conclusion, while the South Pole offers a unique opportunity for scientific discovery, it is essential to consider the potential repercussions of our actions. By adopting responsible and sustainable research practices, we can minimize our impact on the environment and ensure that our pursuit of knowledge does not come at the expense of the very ecosystem we are trying to understand.

Some people,however, think that other types of progress are equally important for a country.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;This is a world that fast developing and full of pollution.there is a worldwide problem whether economic progress is the most important goal when the other types problem are increasing. In my word is economic progress is important than other problems.Firstly,this is an economic world. human life condition is base on their income. For example,there have a village with poor people. They might working hard for live but they must have no time to think about other goal. This is reason why the governments to develop social economic . it is not uncommon that government have no money to solve the problem that environment pollution and others.Second, although economic progress is necessary for people but it also lead to other problems. With the increasing income it might need more resources to build the country. If it not solved correctly that give rise to more problems. The other types of progress will have a good developing when the economic progress finished and the government get enough money.Overall , i prefer economic progress to other types of progress. The better life come from money and the solution of the other types problem are come from the good economy.;In today's fast-paced world, economic progress has become the primary driving force behind human development. As the world grapples with the challenges of rapid industrialization and urbanization, it is undeniable that pollution has become a significant byproduct of our relentless pursuit of growth. However, I firmly believe that economic progress takes precedence over other problems, including environmental concerns.The reason for this prioritization is simple: a better life is inextricably linked to financial stability. Money provides the means to access quality education, healthcare, and other essential services that are crucial for a decent standard of living. In a world where resources are limited, economic progress ensures that individuals and communities have the financial wherewithal to afford these basic necessities. Without economic progress, it is unlikely that people would be able to enjoy the comforts and luxuries that make life worth living.While some may argue that environmental degradation and social welfare are equally important, I would counter that economic progress is the foundation upon which these other aspects of society are built. A strong economy creates jobs, stimulates innovation, and generates tax revenue that can be used to fund social programs and environmental initiatives. In other words, economic progress is the engine that drives social mobility, improves living standards, and ultimately, leads to a better quality of life.In conclusion, while pollution and other environmental issues are pressing concerns, I firmly believe that economic progress is the key to unlocking a better life. The benefits of economic growth, including improved living standards, access to education and healthcare, and increased social mobility, far outweigh the costs. As such, I prioritize economic progress over other types of progress, recognizing that a strong economy is the foundation upon which a prosperous and sustainable society is built.
555;Write about the following topic.Many parents today organise extra classes for their children after school and at the weekends.Do you feel that this is a worthwhile thing to do or do you feel children have enough education at school?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays educational institutions are equipped with devices that were unimaginable only a few years ago, which offer many opportunities to children to study every kind of subject. In other words, the technology introduced in schools helps many children to learn various subjects with different gadgets, such geography, art, maths by computers or history by means of audio-visual-techniques. However, I believe that children thanks to these appealing methods of learning have enough education and they need some time to unwind and experience their life with other activites.To begin with, apply children to extra classes at the weekends has become an issue of debate by many people. I hold firmly to the belief that children after schools need to dedicate their free time on sports. However, sports and other physical activities help young people to enhance their concentration, self-esteem and cognitive skills, social skills with their peer group. For example the most popular and suitable to children are sports with teams, such as football, basketball etc... where children could learn how to collaborate with other mates and the leadership skills gained in sports can help kids to excel in school, life and in the workplace, such as organising a good teamwork.On the other hand, there are few parents who argue that children need to attend extra classes at schools during the weekends. For instance, the world is still facing a global pandemic of covid-19, which caused many problems of attendency of students in many educational institutions due to various measures introduced. However this led many students to lazyness and reduction of methods of gaining knowledge, because it is widely believed that online lessons are not interactive as the lessons in presence. Moreover using continously a technological gadget for hours may cause distraction and negative mental effects. So the better solution for some people is to let their children do extra classes in presence in order to make up for the hours lost during the online lessons.To sum up, children need to experience different activities afterschool in order to have a good educational career. However some parents consider the extra classes an acceptable opportunity to not lose the methods of studying.;The notion that children should be enrolled in extra classes on weekends has sparked a heated debate among many individuals. While some argue that additional academic instruction is essential for a child's intellectual development,I firmly believe that children,children,after school need to dedicate their free time to sports rather than extra classes. Thanks to the appealing methods of learning, children nowadays have access to sufficient education during the weekdays. Therefore, they need some time to unwind and experience life through other activities. Engaging in sports is an excellent way for children to spend their free time, as it provides them with a unique opportunity to develop their physical and mental abilities.Participating in sports can help children develop important life skills such as teamwork, discipline, and perseverance. Moreover, sports activities can help children to stay healthy and fit, which is essential for their overall well-being. By dedicating their free time to sports, children can also learn valuable lessons about fair play, sportsmanship, and friendship. Furthermore, sports can provide children with a much-needed break from the academic pressures of school, allowing them to recharge and refocus for the upcoming week.In conclusion, I strongly believe that children should spend their free time engaging in sports rather than attending extra classes. This will enable them to develop their physical and mental abilities, learn important life skills, and maintain a healthy balance between academics and leisure activities. By prioritizing sports, we can help children grow into well-rounded, happy, and healthy individuals who are equipped to succeed in all aspects of life.
305;Write about the following topic.Many people use written language in a less formal and more relaxed way. Why? Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, written language is used in comparatively more informal and relaxed way. I assume that it happens because of the need of making communication easier and faster. Without features of formal written language it is simplier to share your idea in a shorter period of time. This option is essential in a modern temp of life. This essay will cover both advantages and disadvantages of this development.The less formal and tense written language provides some pros. First of all, without formalization the process of communication requires less amount of time. Then letters consists of less number of symbols and can help to solve the discussed problem much faster. Moreover, this way of communication does not support formal borders between members of a dialogue. Then it is easier to come closer with the interlocutor and feel no pressure during the using of written language.On the other hand, development of making written language more informal and relaxed has some cons. Firstly, communication goes less respectful. Then interlocutors have almost no opportunity to pay a respect to each other. Formalized written language is significant in issue of social borders that can hihlight a paid respect. Secondly, sometimes the main gist of the letter goes unclear, because informal language is more relaxed. In these conditions, the quidity of the letter can be hidden with less formal features. If participants of the communication are not close, they will not understand each other correctly.In conclusion I would like to say that the process of using written language in a more informal way has both advantages and disadvantages. It can be revealed in different situations. That is why everyone should have their own opinion based on the information discussed in this essay.;The use of written language has undergone a significant transformation in recent years. Unlike the past, where written language was characterized by its formality and strict adherence to grammatical rules, the modern era has seen a shift towards a more informal and relaxed approach. This trend is evident in the way people communicate through social media, blogs, and text messages, where the tone is often casual and conversational.One of the primary advantages of this shift is that it makes it simpler to share ideas and express oneself. Without the constraints of formal written language, individuals can convey their thoughts and opinions in a more natural and spontaneous way. The less formal and tense written language provides several benefits, including increased accessibility and a sense of community. People feel more comfortable sharing their ideas and engaging with others when the language is relaxed and easy to understand.On the other hand, the development of making written language more informal has some drawbacks. One of the main concerns is that the loss of formality can lead to a lack of clarity and precision. When language is too casual, it can be misinterpreted or misunderstood, leading to confusion and miscommunication. Furthermore, the over-reliance on informal language can also erode the importance of proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation, which are essential skills for effective communication.In conclusion, the shift towards a more informal written language has both pros and cons. While it has made it easier for people to share their ideas and connect with others, it also poses a risk to the quality and clarity of communication. As we navigate this new landscape of written language, it is essential to strike a balance between informality and formality, ensuring that our messages are conveyed clearly and effectively.
1051;"Write about the following topic.Most people have forgotten the meaning behind traditional or religious festivals; during festival periods, people nowadays only want to enjoy themselves.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.";"In recent years, it is argued that many people have lost track of the meaning behind traditional and religious celebrations; Now, people seem to treat these celebrations as another holiday break. The following essay will fully endorse the statement and examine the reasons behind it.Firstly, there are several reasons why people forgot about the message behind celebrations. One of the most significant one is globalisation. As people start connecting with each other through social media worldwide, many people are too distracted with the latest trends and updates. A study from Yales University mentioned that 60% of the population on earth do not persuit the stories about their traditional roots and background. Hence, they do not celebrate festive or cultural events meaningfully. Another important reason is broken families. People who experienced a tough childhood without a male or female parent are not capable of understanding their own traditions and values. Therefore, they do not grasp the concept of cultural celebrations.Moreover, there are also cons to this arguments as people just want to take a holiday break. Although people may argue that it is important to remember the intention behind diverse celebrations, others just want to use the day for self-fulfillment purposes. For example, people would organise a party and invite friends over to their house so they can have a good time. Another argument that people only want enjoyment during festive periods is work-stress related illnesses. The majority of middle class workers are hardworking and dedicated to their job. However, the period of time for holiday breaks are significantly short and they just want to use the celebration events to rest at home. Despite the fact that they are neglecting their duties to demonstrate the meaning behind these celebrations to the younger generations, they also have a right to take care of themselves mentally and physically before others.In conclusion, there are both sides of the argument on why people think others have forgotten the meaning behind event celebrations and why this is not neccesarily true all the time. Personally, I agree that people should always find the meaning behind these celebrations in order to understand themselves better.";The world has become increasingly secular, and as a result, many people have lost touch with the significance and meaning behind traditional and religious celebrations. This statement is a harsh reality that warrants attention and examination. In recent years, it has become evident that the true essence of these celebrations has been overshadowed by commercialism and cultural assimilation.A study conducted by Yale University revealed a startling statistic: 60% of the global population do not pursue the stories and legends surrounding their traditional roots. This staggering figure suggests that a significant portion of the world's population has become disconnected from their cultural heritage. The reasons behind this trend are multifaceted. One major factor is the increasing influence of globalization, which has led to the homogenization of cultures and the erosion of traditional practices.Furthermore, the commercialization of celebrations has also played a significant role in the loss of their original meaning. Holidays such as Christmas and Halloween have become more about consumerism and materialism, rather than their original religious or cultural significance. As a result, the stories, legends, and values that underpin these celebrations have been lost in the noise of modern society. The consequences of this trend are far-reaching, leading to a loss of cultural identity and a disconnection from one's heritage. Therefore, it is essential to rekindle an interest in the stories and traditions that underpin our celebrations, and to rediscover the true meaning and significance behind them. By doing so, we can work towards preserving our cultural heritage and promoting a deeper understanding of our roots.

Others, however, think that music can have a negative influence on both.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Music is the moonlight in the gloomy night of life.It is the universal language of mankind.There are mixed opinions about music on whether it is advantageous or not to individuals and society.This essay will discuss about pros and cons of music being part of our life.Some people have a perception that playing or listening to music is not beneficial in any manner. They feel music separates a person from socializing and that it is a form of addiction and distraction.Especially, parents feel that their child's concentration is impacted while multitasking with music and studies.For extroverts its a sort of discomfort or hindrance.Few extroverts feel better to share their feelings and difficulties with others than staying alone and listening to a song. Few recorded instances has suggested that sad music inculcates negative thoughts and aggression while in depression.On the other hand, there are people who think that music having a negative effect on individual and society is completely preposterous.They feel that tunes produces a kind of pleasure which human nature cannot do without.Music is a form of expression of feelings rather than being a hindrance.It greatly helps people to overcome their hurdles.Soothing and melodious music gives a refreshing effect.Jazz and Pop music facilitates society to come together and dance.Concerrts helps certain groups to spend time for relaxation from their busy schedule.Not only that, singing or playing instruments is a form of expression of their feelings.The essay argued that though music is considered to be a distraction , it is a form of rejuvenation to both society and individuals of all age groups.;The Perception of Music: Beneficial or Detrimental?There exists a dichotomy in the perception of music, with some individuals believing it to be detrimental to one's well-being and society, while others vehemently disagree. On one hand, some people perceive music as a hindrance to socialization, claiming that it isolates individuals and prevents them from engaging with others. They also view music as a form of addiction and distraction, asserting that it detracts from more productive pursuits. According to this perspective, excessive music consumption can lead to a decline in social skills and an increase in antisocial behavior.On the other hand, there are those who find the notion that music has a negative impact on individuals and society to be utterly absurd. They argue that music has numerous benefits, including its ability to bring people together, evoke emotions, and provide a means of self-expression. Music has been shown to have a positive impact on mental and physical health, with studies indicating that it can reduce stress, improve mood, and even alleviate symptoms of certain diseases. Moreover, music has the power to unite people across cultures, genres, and generations, fostering a sense of community and social bonding.In conclusion, the perception of music as beneficial or detrimental is a subjective matter that depends on individual perspectives and experiences. While some people may view music as a negative influence, others recognize its numerous benefits and positive impacts on individuals and society. Rather than being a distraction or addiction, music can be a powerful tool for socialization, self-expression, and emotional well-being. Ultimately, music is a universal language that has the ability to transcend boundaries and bring people together, and its value should not be underestimated.
587;Write about the following topic.Nowadays, sports is a big business with high earnings for professional sports people and companies involved both financially and other ways. Is this a positive or negative development for sports?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is argued that using mobile devices is as antisocial as smoking and that in certain areas smoking has been forbidden so mobile devices should be prohibited as well. I strongly disagree with this statement because this would not solve the initial problem and could turn out expensive as well.Firstly, banning mobile devices from certain places would be exagerated. This is because smoking actually damages your body, while the use of mobile phones is comparatively harmless. For example, a recent research found out that the risk of lung cancer grows by 0,02% with every cigarette, while high screen time has less damaging side effects like the loss of concentration. Altough the use of mobile phones is sometimes antisocial, I think that we should concentrate on the origins of this problem than simply prohibit it in certain areas.Secondly, banning mobile devices would have a regulatory side effect which could be expensive. The government would have to decide on new laws as well as implement them. Furthermore, it would be no easy task for the police to control these rules in an efficient way. As a result, police would struggle with a high workload. Admittely, I have enough faith in our legal system and I am sure that they could manage it but I think that we have more prescious und urgent tasks to concentrate on.In conclusion, I strongly disagree with banning mobile devices in certain areas. However, I admit that we use our phones too much which sometimes leads to antisocial behaviour. Nevertheless, prohibiting the phones in certain areas would not solve this problem and could as well be expensive for the government.;The notion that using mobile devices is as antisocial as smoking has sparked a heated debate. Proponents of this idea suggest that mobile devices are a hindrance to social interaction and should be treated similarly to smoking, with restrictions and bans in public places. However, I strongly disagree with this statement. Banning mobile devices would not solve the initial problem of antisocial behavior. Mobile devices are merely a tool, and it is the individual's choice to use them in a way that is either social or antisocial. Moreover, banning mobile devices could turn out to be an expensive endeavor. The implementation and enforcement of such a ban would require significant resources, which could be better spent on addressing the root causes of antisocial behavior.Furthermore, banning mobile devices would have regulatory side effects that could be costly. For instance, the mobile device industry is a significant contributor to many economies, and restricting its use could have unintended consequences on employment and economic growth. Additionally, the development of alternative technologies and infrastructure to support a mobile device-free society would require substantial investment.In conclusion, while the intention behind the comparison of mobile device use to smoking may be to promote social interaction, it is a misguided approach. Rather than banning mobile devices, we should focus on promoting responsible and considerate use of these devices, and addressing the underlying issues that contribute to antisocial behavior. By doing so, we can create a more harmonious and inclusive society, where mobile devices are used to enhance social interaction, rather than hinder it. Ultimately, a balanced and nuanced approach is needed to address the complex issues surrounding mobile device use, rather than resorting to simplistic and potentially costly solutions.

Some sociologists claim that parents and other members of society often set a bad example.Discuss the causes and some effects of widespread drug use by young people in modern day society. Make any recommendations you feel are necessary to help fight youth drug abuse.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The use of drugs has been a warning habit in modern day society. In some research, it shows that households are losing their financing easily due to the fact that one of the parents has been addicted to drugs. Although there are some drugs which were approved by the government to be used moderately, yet some people are using these drugs heavily.This has drawn the attention of the youth either by a drug addict parent or a friend. Moreover, the number of youngsters taking drugs has increased dramatically throughout the years as there are people who provide these drugs in the black market. This critical issue has caused serious issues both socially and mentally.The social and mental impact of using drugs by the youngsters have damaged the educational progress, the social participation such as family and friends gatherings. Additionally, lack of stamina, weight loss, and loss of appetite are key factors of excessive use of drugs.There is a number of contributing elements to the phenomena. One of these elements is the sense of belonging to a group. Since humans are social animals, young people want to have the feeling of being accepted and loved, and this can be sensible when it comes to a group of friends. Therefore, once someone introduces a drug, the rest of the group will try, and if one says no, then they will be rejected. However, this rejection can be helping to solve this alarming issue.The solution is to find a way to distinguish the types of drugs and legalize the ones that do not harm greatly and prepare in parallel the better ways to control the consumption of drugs.;The use of drugs has become a alarming habit in modern day society, posing a significant threat to the well-being of individuals, particularly youngsters. This critical issue has far-reaching consequences, both socially and mentally, affecting not only the users but also their families and communities. The social and mental impact of drug use among youngsters is a matter of grave concern, as it has the potential to damage their educational progress and social participation.Drug use can lead to a decline in academic performance, as users often experience impaired cognitive function, memory loss, and decreased motivation. This can result in poor grades, increased absenteeism, and ultimately, a higher dropout rate. Furthermore, drug use can also lead to social isolation, as users may withdraw from social interactions and relationships, fearing judgment or rejection. This can lead to a lack of social skills, poor communication, and difficulty forming and maintaining healthy relationships.Moreover, drug use can have severe mental health consequences, including anxiety, depression, and psychosis. Youngsters who use drugs are more likely to experience mental health issues, which can further exacerbate their social and academic problems. The long-term effects of drug use can be devastating, leading to a lifetime of addiction, health problems, and social and economic marginalization.It is essential to address this critical issue through education, prevention, and intervention. Schools, families, and communities must work together to provide youngsters with the support and resources they need to make informed decisions about drug use. By promoting healthy lifestyles, providing counseling and treatment services, and encouraging social participation, we can help youngsters avoid the dangers of drug use and reach their full potential. Ultimately, it is our collective responsibility to ensure that youngsters are equipped with the knowledge, skills, and support to make positive choices and lead healthy, productive lives.

This researches get the attention of the organizations and help them to shape their designs of their offices or buildings.

Because of our visual plays an important role in our pyschology, colours are becoming important issue that needs to be point out. For example, the alertness effect of red colour on human's feeling is well known by the goverments. In order to alert people, stop signs or traffic lights are always include some level of red colour. This way, humans can be warned and accidents numbers can be decreased.Also, this affect of colours can play a big role in our health and work place.

They are being used by the organizations to benefit from this effect.;The relationship between colours and human feelings has long fascinated psychologists, becoming a significant area of research. The impact of colours on human emotions and behaviour is a complex phenomenon that has garnered considerable attention. In this essay, I will delve into the effects of colours and their influence on various aspects of human life. It is undeniable that certain colours have a profound impact on our mental state and feelings, shaping our perceptions, attitudes, and interactions.Research has shown that colours can evoke strong emotional responses, with different hues eliciting distinct reactions. For instance, the colour red is often associated with feelings of energy, passion, and excitement, while blue is commonly linked to calmness,,assistantand serenity.

Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"In development countries they must allow works for people who have skills and experience employees from poor countries. I agree with this point of view because everyone they should have a chance. There were a opportunities and benefits.The first point, I would like to make is that there were a great opportunities for both rich countries and people who came from poor areas. When people thinking to transfer abroad there were many reason but the most important when they want a chance to show of there craft and ability. Such as, Indian people they travelled many areas and they give them a lot of discoveries and skills; moreover, the rich countries need some people to help to make their country better place for living. For example, I have read an article in the newspaper they talked about development countries like UK, US and Arabic countries they need those people to improve their economy and life.The second point, I will clarify is that there were many benefits when this countries allow jobs for those. They will be equality for all ;furthermore, there will be a improvement in living. For instance, I have saw a T.V decomontry they say "" In United States there are a equality and improvement in live between people they came from Africaand citizens they help them to have good education, skills and experience also they contribute the US economy to growth "".Finally, we can say that there were a opportunities and benefits for both sides. I am with this to have good life for all. I hope in the future poor countries they can take benefits from those people and developed their country to came better than now .";The issue of allowing skilled and experienced employees from poor countries to work in developed countries has sparked a heated debate. In my opinion, I strongly agree with the notion that developed countries should open their doors to talented individuals from impoverished nations. This stance is rooted in the belief that everyone deserves an equal chance to succeed, regardless of their country of origin.By permitting skilled workers from poor countries to work in developed nations, we can foster a more equitable and inclusive global economy. This approach not only benefits the individual workers but also enriches the host country with diverse perspectives,. Furthermore, it can help to bridge the skill gap in developed countries, where there may be shortages in certain professions. For instance, nurses, doctors, and engineers from developing countries can fill critical gaps in the healthcare and infrastructure sectors of developed nations.Moreover, allowing skilled workers from poor countries to work in developed countries can have a positive impact on their home countries as well. These individuals can send remittances back to their families, which can help to alleviate poverty and stimulate economic growth. Additionally, they can acquire new skills and knowledge, which they can bring back to their home countries, contributing to their nation's development.In conclusion, I firmly believe that developed countries should provide opportunities for skilled and experienced employees from poor countries to work in their territories. This is not only a matter of social justice but also a sound economic strategy. By embracing diversity and inclusivity, we can create a more prosperous and interconnected world, where everyone has a chance to thrive, regardless of their nationality or background. Ultimately, this approach can lead to a more equitable distribution of wealth and opportunities, and help to reduce poverty and inequality globally.
973;Write about the following topic.Some organisations believe that their employees should dress smartly. Others value quality of work above appearance.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Manners in the workplace have always been a topic that is discussed by many people as it is essential to know how we should behave in such a formal environment. Some companies give the opinion that their workers should have a smart look while others consider the attitude toward the job more important.To my mind, appearance should not the only thing to be considered. We can dress smartly and impress others, but it is only the first impression. Therefore, productivity, quality of work, and the way we are responsible for our tasks are things that make us outstanding workers. Moreover, it is obvious that the success of one company does not depend on how its employees dress but on how it is organized.In spite of the fact that dressing does not play a key role in the value of a worker, a neat and intelligent appearance still gives us significant benefits. I always suggest that one should dress suitably in different situations. In fact, it is not crucial for an organization to ask their employees to dress formally, but a set of smart casual clothes is something that we should wear when it comes to the working environment. It is because that wearing politely shows how we respect our jobs, our employers, and even our workmates. In some cases, a company's professionalism can be seen through the way its workers wear.To sum up, dressing smartly is not the best and only thing that one worker can do to have better performance. However, having a good appearance is something that great employees would do since it can be considered as their respect for the jobs.;"The debate about what makes an outstanding worker has sparked a lot of discussion among companies. While some companies emphasize the importance of a ""smart look"" for their employees, others prioritize the attitude towards the job. In my opinion, the emphasis on appearance alone is misguided. A smart look may create a good first impression, but it is not the sole determining factor of a worker's capabilities.Productivity, quality of work, and a sense of responsibility are, to me, the essential qualities that make a worker stand out. A worker who is diligent, efficient, and dedicated to their tasks is far more valuable than one who simply looks the part. It is the output and the results that matter, not the packaging. A well-dressed employee who lacks motivation and work ethic can ultimately hinder the progress of a company, whereas a worker who may not conform to traditional dress codes but delivers high-quality work consistently is an asset.Moreover, prioritizing appearance over attitude and work quality can lead to a superficial work environment where employees feel pressured to conform to certain standards rather than focus on their actual performance. This can stifle creativity, innovation, and overall job satisfaction. On the other hand, focusing on productivity, quality, and responsibility fosters a culture of hard work, dedication, and excellence, which are the true hallmarks of outstanding workers.In conclusion, while appearance may play a role in making a good impression, it should not be the only consideration. Companies should look beyond the superficial and prioritize the qualities that truly contribute to a worker's success and the company's prosperity. By doing so, they can cultivate a team of outstanding workers who are not only presentable but also highly competent and dedicated to their work."

Others believe that some information is too important or too valuable to be shared freely.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In recent years, some people believe that it is good to share information about scientific research, business and the academic field to many people. Others reckon that such informations are too important or too valuable to be share for free. Here are discussions of the statements and my opinion.By development of the technology, people can more likely to access to valuable information such as experimental results and interviewing results of citizens than before. Some people use it for their academic interests or for the business strategies, so that people believe that such information contribute to companies profits or individuals' advantages in academic. For example, many of the medical students read dissertation of diseases, which were written in the past. By reading and using the scientific information students will become excellent professionals.On the other hand, people can access informations from any countries via internet. Recently, increasing the cyber crimes is the serious problem all over the world. Therefore some people reckon that it is too risky to share valuable informations. If information on valuable national research results is leaked, the country would had enormous loss for the economy.To sum up ,sharing as much informations as possible is useful for the everyone to improve their academic skills and contribute to their companies, while easier access to every aspects of informations might bring disadvantages such as information leakage or cybercrime. In my opinion, I mostly agree with it is good to share information, but I believe the source of information needs to be careful not to misuse the sources.;The dissemination of information has become a highly debated topic in recent years. On one hand, there are those who believe that sharing information about scientific research, business, and the academic field with the general public is highly beneficial. They argue that by making such information accessible, people can gain a deeper understanding of various subjects, as well as stay updated on the latest developments. This, in turn, can foster innovation, collaboration, and progress in various fields. Moreover, sharing information can also promote transparency and accountability, as people are better equipped to make informed decisions.On the other hand, there are those who believe that such information is too valuable or sensitive to be shared freely. They argue that sensitive business information, cutting-edge research, or proprietary academic knowledge can be misused or exploited if it falls into the wrong hands. Additionally, they believe that the effort and resources invested in producing such information warrant some form of compensation or protection. They advocate for controlling access to such information, limiting it to those who have a legitimate need or are willing to pay for it.However, it is essential to strike a balance between these two perspectives. While it is crucial to protect sensitive information, it is also important to recognize the benefits of sharing knowledge and promoting collaboration. Perhaps, a middle ground can be found, where information is shared in a controlled and responsible manner, with measures in place to prevent misuse or exploitation. Ultimately, the dissemination of information about scientific research, business, and the academic field should be guided by a careful consideration of the potential benefits and risks, with the aim of promoting progress, innovation, and the greater good. By doing so, we can harness the power of information to drive positive change and improvement in various aspects of our lives.
273;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Environmental problems are the biggest issue that people have to concern and by product form fossil fuels is one of causes. Someone think one way that can reduce result from fuels is sale car fuels in higher price. In my opinion, I disagree with this because highly price of oil leads to other problems such as financial problem and impact to food price, moreover, we can heal their environment by other ways.The negative effects of increasing the cost of vehciles fuels are improtant to human life. The significant points is price of basic requirements, for instance, foods and medicines which have to transportation by trucks that use oil fuels for movement. The expensive fuels increase business costs, so their products price are rising up. Futhermore, social problems follow by financial problems. When poor people do not have money but they still hunger, they will steal some food or water this situation roads to social problems.Other ways to reduce environment problems, the causes of this problem are not only fossil fuel but also agricultural or industial aspect which we have to focus on. Intustial areas are the top areas that make lot of pollutions such as air pollution, water pollution from thier procesing and chemical pollution which they use during process. Those of them lead to many problems and effect to qulity of human life. Moveover agricultural areas, there produce many of gas which result to global warming.In conclusion, the increasing car fuels might reduce some of environmental problems but also have drawback to population life. We should to chooce other ways to protect enviromant without effect to our life.;The increasing cost of vehicle fuels has far-reaching negative effects on human life, making it a pressing concern that warrants attention. One of the most significant impacts of rising fuel costs is the subsequent increase in the price of basic requirements, such as food and medicine. As fuel prices soar, the cost of transportation and production also rises, leading to a surge in the prices of essential goods.The ripple effect of expensive fuels is felt across various industries, particularly in the transportation and logistics sectors. Businesses are forced to absorb the increased costs of fuel, which in turn, leads to higher production and transportation costs. Consequently, the prices of their products also rise, making them less affordable for the average consumer. This is particularly concerning for low-income households, who already struggle to make ends meet. The increased cost of basic necessities, such as food and medicine, can have devastating effects on their well-being and quality of life.Furthermore, the rising cost of fuels can also have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and those with chronic illnesses, who may rely on medication and other essential goods to survive. As the prices of these goods continue to rise, it can become increasingly difficult for them to access the necessities they need to maintain their health and well-being. Therefore, it is essential to address the issue of rising fuel costs and mitigate its negative effects on human life. By exploring alternative energy sources and implementing policies to reduce fuel costs, we can help ensure that basic requirements, such as food and medicine, remain affordable and accessible to all. Ultimately, the consequences of inaction far outweigh the costs of addressing this critical issue, and it is our responsibility to take action to protect the well-being of individuals and communities worldwide.
135;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that school children should not be given homework by their teachers, whereas others argue that homework plays an important role in the education of children.Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The issue that whether teachers should assign homework or not has attracted great attention recently.Some people believe that homework is a good way to consolidate students'learning effect.However,others argue that homework exerts huge pressure on students,which is bad for their long-term development.As for me,appropriate homework should be seen as the better choice.I will explain my idea from two aspects.Firstly,homework could examine student's learning results.After teaching the basic content,giving some homework is important to consolidate the knowledge.As an old saying goes,practice makes things perfect.Only doing many practices,can we master the knowledge proficiently.There is an example.In my teaching experiences,I found the students finishing their homework better would achieve higher scores in final examination,while those who couldn't finish their ordinary homework would gain lower grades in any examination.And my translation skills were also improved by practicing the homework from my guiders who gave the targeted examination to me.Secondly,too much homework will cause so many negative effects,such as making students tired very much,causing their depressed mood and their bored emotion.For example,my brother's daughter always suffered from the huge homework which was assigned by his Chinese teacher.She once complained with me that everyday she felt tired and bored after finishing Chinese teacher's assignments.So appropriate homework is reasonable for most students and those ideas that the more homework,the better students' scores ,are wrong to certain extent.Sometimes huge homework is the reason that why some students'scores are reduced.In sum,removing homework is not an ideal option for student's improvement in learning,and reasonable homework provides us a better way to deal with the problem.That is to say,we should strike a balance between assigning homework and removing homework.;The debate about homework has been a long-standing issue in the educational sector. Some people believe that homework is a good way to consolidate students' learning effect, as it reinforces the concepts and skills learned in the classroom. They argue that homework helps students to develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter, as well as improves their critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Moreover, homework enables teachers to assess students' progress and identify areas where they need extra support.On the other hand, there are those who argue that homework exerts huge pressure on students, which is detrimental to their long-term development. They claim that excessive homework can lead to stress, anxiety, and a negative attitude towards learning. Furthermore, excessive homework can limit students' free time, hindering their ability to engage in extracurricular activities, sports, and socialize with their peers, which are essential for their physical, emotional, and social growth.As for me, I believe that appropriate homework should be seen as the better choice. Homework, when assigned in moderation, can be beneficial in reinforcing learning and promoting academic achievement. However, it is crucial that teachers strike a balance between assigning homework that is challenging yet manageable, and allowing students sufficient time to complete it without feeling overwhelmed. Appropriate homework should also be relevant, interesting, and aligned with the learning objectives, making it a valuable tool for learning consolidation rather than a source of stress. By finding this balance, educators can ensure that homework supports students' learning and development, rather than hindering it. Ultimately, the key to making homework effective is to make it purposeful, reasonable, and student-centered.
525;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child's development while others think that it is important for children to go to school.Discuss the advantages of both methods and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In regards to the notion 'it is important for children to go to school', there are two contrasting opinions of supporting it and also disagreeing with it. Schools are conceptually thought to be essential and compulsory for many parents while others may not despite of what the society says.There are people who suggest that going to school is indeed necessary for children and students as it enables them to develop social ability and make friends which will ultimately be useful in the future. Attending school, a microsom of society, itself already teaches young students how to interact with other people ouside of family tree. Those who did not attend school when they were young may have severly low EQ or lacking interaction ability. For instance, an adult who was studying at home might not know how to respect and share objects with others. By being enrolled in a school, children can make remarkable childhood memories that may help them in the future when they are in a slump or depression.On the other hand, some people may disagree to this notion as they think studying at home is far more effective. Their argument might be that going to school would be a waste of time as children usually play around at school. Teaching children can be much more efficient as transportation time and playing time can be eliminatied by not going to school. Furthermore, as children do not have to go out, there will not be any conflicts on bullying or fight with friends. They will not fall onto deviation such as smoking, drinking et cetera which are usually encountered at school due to bad friends. Also, money can be saved by teaching at home as uniforms, for example, do not have to purchased.All in all, although young students might have number of advantages by not going to school, it is nevertheless more important to attend school in a daily basis to improve their social ability and interaction with other people.;"The notion that ""it is important for children to go to school"" is a widely debated topic among parents and educators. While many believe that attending school is essential and compulsory for children, others disagree, arguing that alternative methods of education, such as homeschooling, are just as effective. Proponents of traditional schooling argue that it provides children with a unique opportunity to develop social skills and form meaningful relationships with their peers. By interacting with children of different backgrounds and personalities, students learn valuable skills such as communication, empathy, and conflict resolution.Moreover, attending school enables children to make friends, which is crucial for their emotional and psychological development. Friendships formed in school can last a lifetime, providing children with a support network and a sense of belonging. On the other hand, some people disagree with this notion, suggesting that studying at home is a more effective way of learning. They argue that homeschooling allows children to learn at their own pace, without the distractions and pressures of a traditional school environment. Additionally, homeschooling provides parents with greater control over their child's curriculum, enabling them to tailor their education to their individual needs and interests.However, it is essential to note that traditional schooling offers a structured and well-rounded education, with access to resources and facilities that may not be available at home. Furthermore, schools provide children with a safe and supervised environment, where they can learn and grow under the guidance of qualified teachers. In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, it is generally accepted that attending school is essential for children's social, emotional, and academic development. By providing a supportive and inclusive environment, schools play a vital role in shaping the minds of future generations."
323;Write about the following topic.Some people believe women are better leaders than men. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is argued by some individuals that men aren't skilled enough as women in regard to leadership. This essay disagrees with the given statement as leadership skills are not depending on gender but are strongly related to people's personality and work experience.The role of a leader should not be stereotyped according to gender, for example, women might be considered more powerful than men because they could normally appear more organised and perfectionist. Indeed, several studies concerning leadership and the role of the leader, have demonstrated that some people have innate attitudes of a leader regardless of their gender. Some of those attitudes are related to active listening, emotional intelligence skills and great communication abilities. Thus, if effectively developed and fostered, those skills can support individuals to achieve higher roles in leadership and management.In the same way, the working experience also plays a crucial role in determining and further developing leadership skills. For example, a large number of women are still renouncing to their career paths in order to care for their families. Indeed, most of the women, apply for part-time roles which do not offer the opportunity to achieve a leadership role despite their abilities. For this reason, is difficult to affirm if women are better than men in leadership.To conclude, the role of a leader is shaped by innate characteristics and people's personalities regardless of their gender. Moreover, the poor presence of women employed in leadership roles does not create pieces of evidence to support such a point of view.;The notion that leadership skills are tied to gender is a misconception that has been debunked by various studies. In reality, leadership abilities are not determined by one's sex, but rather by their personality and work experience. Effective leaders possess certain traits such as confidence, empathy, and strategic thinking, which are not exclusive to any particular gender. Regardless of their gender, individuals with these qualities, along with extensive work experience, are more likely to excel in leadership positions. However, despite the progress made in promoting gender equality in the workplace, a significant number of women still find themselves at a crossroads, forced to choose between their career aspirations and family responsibilities. Many women are renouncing their career paths to care for their families, which not only hinders their personal growth but also deprives organizations of talented and skilled leaders. This trend is a result of societal expectations and the lack of support systems for working mothers. It is imperative that we work towards creating a more inclusive and supportive work environment that allows women to balance their professional and personal responsibilities. By doing so, we can tap into the vast potential of female leaders and promote a more diverse and equitable leadership landscape. Ultimately, it is the combination of personality, work experience, and a supportive environment that fosters strong leadership, not gender. As we continue to break down these barriers, we will undoubtedly witness a surge in female leaders who will bring unique perspectives and skills to the table, enriching their organizations and society as a whole.

Others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Packing of goods has become a noticeable issue nowadays, especially in terms of environmental concerns and sustainable development of society. In order to reduce the amount of packaging, some people believe that manufacturers and supermarkets are more responsible for taking measures, while others insist that customers play a more critical role in reality. In my view, the effort needs to be made by the supplier and the consumer both to guarantee the achievement of the goal.On the one hand, the problem of over-packaging is often caused by commercial strategy. The supplier attempts to use beautiful packaging to make their products more attractive to customers. It is fairly easy to imagine that people would be more likely to choose a product decorated gorgeously than the same one with a plain appearance provided that there is thus no significant increase in price. Following that, producers would try to make every effort to obtain more competitive packaging for their products, which probably leads to excessive use of the wrap. Therefore, it is undoubtedly the duty of the producer to partake in reducing the amount of over-packaging by finding another way to improve the competitiveness of their products instead of merely attaching more value to their appearance.On the other hand, the behaviors of customers give rise to over-packaging as well. The more attention that people will pay to the appearance of goods, the more encouraged producers will be to exert themselves on wrapping. Moreover, the public awareness about the harmful influence of over-packaging is also profound in decreasing the amount of packaging. As customers take the problems caused by over-packaging into account, they would be more willing to purchase the goods with less packaging, which is a highly practical way to prevent producers from wrapping unduly.In conclusion, it is clear that suppliers and customers both are responsible for the trend of over-packaging. Therefore, the success of altering the situation needs the participation of them both.;The packing of goods has become a noticeable issue in today's world. The excessive use of packaging materials has led to a significant increase in waste and pollution, which is detrimental to the environment. In response to this issue, some people argue that manufacturers and supermarkets are more responsible for taking measures to reduce packaging waste. However, in my view, the effort needs to be made by both the supplier and the consumer to guarantee the achievement of the goal.On the one hand, manufacturers and supermarkets do have a significant role to play in reducing packaging waste. They can adopt sustainable packaging practices, such as using biodegradable materials, reducing packaging sizes, and promoting refill options. By making these changes, they can significantly reduce the amount of waste generated by their products. Moreover, they can also influence consumer behavior by providing education and awareness about the importance of sustainable packaging.On the other hand, consumers also have a crucial role to play in reducing packaging waste. They can make informed choices by choosing products with minimal or biodegradable packaging, avoiding single-use items, and recycling as much as possible. Additionally, consumers can also demand more sustainable packaging options from manufacturers and supermarkets, which can drive change in the industry. By working together, both suppliers and consumers can create a significant impact and achieve the goal of reducing packaging waste.In conclusion, reducing packaging waste requires a collective effort from both suppliers and consumers. While manufacturers and supermarkets have a responsibility to adopt sustainable packaging practices, consumers also have a role to play in making informed choices and demanding change. By working together, we can reduce packaging waste and create a more sustainable future for our planet. Ultimately, it is a shared responsibility that requires the effort and commitment of both parties to achieve the desired outcome.
181;Write about the following topic.Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding change. Others, however, think that change is always a good thing.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people rather doing the same things over and over avoiding change, meanwhile others consider change as a positive thing. Some people are probably afraid of change and for this reason they prefer staying in the confort zone because it's something familiar. On the other hand, others believe that change is a good opportunity to grow and discover new things.Changing it's not for everybody, because there are people that doesn't like it, so they try to avoid it. Spending the whole life doing the same thing is not as bad as change for some people. This is probably linked to the fact that sometime change is something unknown. So, sometime people prefere to stay in their confort zone because even if it's not the best at least is something familiar. For example, people that hate their jobs but are stuck with it, is because they're too afraid to change it and land in a worse place or position. So they rather stay in that place because they're too afraid to lose it and end up worse. I believe that this is an understandable and common reason around people, however i believe that change can give more chances for improvement.Other people believes that change is always a positive thing. Changing is an opportunity to grow and discover new things, It's a chance to achieve something better and improve. There are people who doesn't like to be in the same place (phisically, economically or emotionally) and prefer changing. For instance, going to a new country because the idea of living in the same place forever is not charming enough, so find out new places to see, and places to feel confortable ,emotionally and economically for instance, is something that only people who are hungry enough of change would do it. I believe that sometime it's better risk it than live the same life everyday.In conclusion, the preference about change depends on people and wheter is beneficial or not depends on the different point of views and situations. I think, that change is important, everything change even if try to avoid it. So, it's better embrace it because no matter how things go it will leave you either with an experiece or with a lesson. So, in my opinion change is a good thing.;"The concept of change is a multifaceted one, eliciting diverse reactions from individuals. While some people welcome change with open arms, perceiving it as a positive force that brings new experiences and opportunities, others are more apprehensive, preferring the comfort and familiarity of routine. This dichotomy in attitudes towards change is a fundamental aspect of human nature, reflecting the unique preferences, values, and coping mechanisms of individuals.On one hand, there are those who thrive in environments where change is a constant. They view change as a catalyst for growth, a means to acquire new skills, and to broaden their horizons. Such individuals are often described as adventurous, resilient, and adaptable, capable of navigating through the uncertainties that change presents. For them, the prospect of doing something new, meeting new people, or exploring new places is exhilarating, and they actively seek out experiences that challenge their status quo.On the other hand, there are individuals who prefer the stability and predictability of doing the same things over and over. They find comfort in routine and may view change as a source of stress or anxiety. These individuals often prioritize stability and security, preferring to stick with what they know and understand, rather than venturing into the unknown. Their preference for consistency is not a sign of stagnation, but rather a reflection of their personal comfort zone and how they best function.It's essential to recognize that changing is not for everybody. The aversion to change is deeply rooted in human psychology, stemming from fears of the unknown, fear of failure, or simply a preference for the familiar. People who avoid change are not inherently resistant to progress or new experiences; they simply have different coping mechanisms and priorities. Understanding and respecting these differences is crucial in creating inclusive and supportive environments, whether in personal, professional, or social contexts.In conclusion, attitudes towards change vary widely among individuals, reflecting a complex interplay of personal preferences, values, and psychological inclinations. While some embrace change as a positive force, others prefer the comfort of routine. Recognizing and respecting these differences is key to fostering understanding and support, allowing each individual to navigate change, or maintain consistency, in a manner that aligns with their unique needs and aspirations."
149;Write about the following topic.Some people think living in big cities is bad for people’s health.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In the past decades, the rise of urbanization has brought trends of moving into the cities. While some people believe that the availability of resources and welfare in metropolises can outweigh the unhealthy environment, I strongly believe that the fancy infrastructures come in exchange for health sacrifice.To begin with, most megacities are overpopulated. With scarce resources and higher demands in every aspect, products and services received in these bustling locations usually come at a higher price, lower quality and longer waiting time. For example, it could take up to weeks or months to queue up for non-urgent medical services while it takes only a few days or even without booking in non-busy areas. Moreover, the nature of crowded areas accelerates the spreading of transmittable diseases during the pandemic.Another undeniable health factor for those residing in cities is pollution. Most cities come with traffic issues where there are exceeding amounts of cars which create air pollution. It is proved that, in long term, smog in the air could result in respiratory diseases such as lung cancer. Furthermore, the number of the city's population is equal to the extremely large amount of waste and without an appropriate waste management system, it could lead to several more problems. One of them is pests such as mice and bugs which are the perfect mediums for severe diseases such as rabies.All in all, urbanization has tremendous benefits to human society as a whole and is unavoidable in the present context. Thus, governments should focus on addressing these issues to ensure the sustainable progress of cities and the citizens' quality of life.;The past few decades have witnessed a significant rise in urbanization, with an increasing number of people moving into cities in search of better opportunities. However, this trend has also brought about several challenges. One of the most notable consequences is the scarcity of resources, products, and services in these bustling locations. As a result, the cost of living in cities has skyrocketed, with essentials often coming at a higher price, lower quality, and longer waiting times.Furthermore, the crowded nature of urban areas has made them hotbeds for the spread of transmissible diseases, particularly during the pandemic. The high population density and lack of personal space have accelerated the transmission of illnesses, putting residents at a higher risk of infection. This has been evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, where cities have been disproportionately affected due to their densely populated nature.Another undeniable health factor for those residing in cities is pollution. The high concentration of vehicles, industries, and construction activities in urban areas has led to a significant increase in air and noise pollution. This has severe consequences for the health and wellbeing of city dwellers, including respiratory problems, cardiovascular diseases, and other pollution-related ailments. The poor air quality and lack of green spaces in cities have also been linked to mental health issues, such as stress and anxiety.In conclusion, while cities offer many opportunities and advantages, they also come with significant challenges. The scarcity of resources, spread of diseases, and pollution are just a few of the health and environmental concerns that city residents face. It is essential for urban planners and policymakers to address these issues and work towards creating sustainable, healthy, and livable cities for their residents. By doing so, we can mitigate the negative consequences of urbanization and create a better quality of life for city dwellers.

While some people believe that art lessons are a waste of time and that teachers should focus on science subjects, others argue that art is just as essential as math,,assistant, science, and language. Those who oppose art in schools think that it is a frivolous activity that does not provide students with the practical skills they need to succeed in life. They believe that science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects are more valuable and should be prioritized.On the other hand, proponents of art in schools argue that it is a vital part of a well-rounded education. They believe that art lessons help students develop their creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Art also allows students to express themselves and communicate their thoughts and feelings in a unique and meaningful way. Moreover, art is an essential part of human culture and history, and studying it helps students understand and appreciate the world around them.Furthermore, art and science are not mutually exclusive. In fact, many artistic concepts, such as design and architecture, rely heavily on mathematical and scientific principles. By studying art, students can gain a deeper understanding of these concepts and develop their spatial reasoning and visual processing skills. Additionally, art lessons can help students develop their fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, and attention to detail, all of which are essential for success in many fields, including science and technology.In conclusion, art lessons are just as important in school as math, science, and language. They provide students with a unique set of skills and knowledge that are essential for success in all areas of life. Rather than seeing art as a waste of time, we should recognize its value and importance in a well-rounded education. By incorporating art into the curriculum, we can help students develop their creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, and prepare them for success in an increasingly complex and rapidly changing world.
221;Write about the following topic.Some people think that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is believed that responsibility for the rise in obesity in children is on government. I strongly disagree with this opinion. I think that state policy cannot lead to the people's obesity. Moreover, I am sure that only parents are responsible for their children diseases.First of all, it is important to say that government's actions can not be followed with the obesity. It is responsible only for control that all available products are not dangerous for people's health. Food that consist of a lot of fats do not put your health under the threat after the first consumption. Only overeating of this kind of food can be harmful for your health leading obesity. For instance, there is no government's responsibility if you go to the mall and buy 6 cans of beer providing health problem for yourself. I am sure that government is responsible only for making 1 can of beer acceptable for your health.Secondly, children's actions and potential consequences of these actions should be controlled by their parents. Obesity can be a result of a permanent overeating. Because of their age, chilldren cannot control themselves. That is why this responsibility goes on their parents. As it was mentioned before, there is no product that can be harmful for the healh after the first and the only consumption. There is no reason to condemn government because of the permanent consumption of any products. For example, child could eat 3 pieces of cake insted of 1 just because of his wish. In this case, his parents should stop him after the first one to avoid potential obesity.In conclusion, I would like to say that I do not see any reasons to say that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children. It has no responsibility for people's overeating and lack of parents' control over their children.;The notion that the government is solely responsible for the rise in obesity among children is a prevailing opinion. However, I strongly disagree with this perspective. While it is true that governments play a crucial role in ensuring public health, I believe that their responsibility lies in regulating and controlling the safety of products available to the public, rather than dictating individual choices.It is the government's duty to guarantee that all food products and beverages available in the market are safe for consumption and do not pose a threat to people's health. They can achieve this by enforcing strict regulations and standards on food manufacturers, ensuring that products are labeled accurately, and that marketing towards children is fair and not misleading. Nevertheless, the ultimate responsibility for a child's diet and lifestyle lies with their parents or guardians.Parents have a significant influence on their children's eating habits and physical activity levels. They are responsible for providing a balanced diet, encouraging healthy habits, and monitoring their children's screen time and outdoor play. It is the parents' duty to educate their children about the importance of a healthy lifestyle, set a good example, and provide a supportive environment that fosters positive habits. By doing so, parents can empower their children to make informed choices and develop healthy habits that will benefit them throughout their lives.In conclusion, while governments have a role to play in ensuring the safety of food products, the responsibility for the rise in obesity among children cannot be solely attributed to them. Parents and guardians must take an active role in controlling their children's actions and potential consequences, and in promoting healthy habits from a young age. By working together, we can combat the growing issue of childhood obesity and promote a healthier future for generations to come.
565;Write about the following topic.Some people think that it is more beneficial to take part in sports which are played in teams, like football. But others think taking part in individual sports is better, like swimming. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"There are lots of benifits in both party of sports which is group sports and individual sports. Many argue that one is better than another. By analyzing my personal experience, both side advantages and disadvanteges will be discussed.Health, the main factor that make people doing the sport in some extent. Many sports help body to increase the metabolism and keep our figure look slim. For example, like swiming, the sport is well-known for beauty body buidling, many reaserch show that water pressure form muscle into more dynamic beautiful shape than any other sport regardless of safty issues which part of events were practice in open water.Compare to swiming, a group sport like soccer game need 22 players participate into the field. Average soccer player have very powerful core strenth, in order to compete in this match, soccer player need to wear certain protection to prevent from injury such as foot pad to reduce the impact from side kick from other players and ankel protector. Undoubtly, soccer players have most strong body among many sports. However, they are the group of people most likely get injuryed more frequently.Sport also can build trust and friendship between people. In this aspect, both individual sports and group sports are proven that partipating in group games or competing with another player on a 1v1 match can increase the improvement of sportsmanship between people. Like olympic motto, ""stonger, faster and higher"", a good sport can bring people together and compete each other in a fair and friendly enviornment. However, individual sport may get boring faster than group sports due to lack of competition.In conclusion, neither group sports nor individual sports are perfect in every aspects. It is important to found a sport suit for each individual personal interest. All kinds of sports always carry benifits with dangerous if people do not do it well.";The world of sports is diverse and offers numerous benefits to participants, regardless of whether they engage in group or individual sports. Through my personal experience, I have had the opportunity to explore both realms, and I must say that each has its unique advantages and disadvantages. In this essay, I will delve into the benefits of both group and individual sports, and discuss the pros and cons of each, based on my own experiences.On the one hand, group sports such as soccer, basketball, and volleyball, offer a plethora of benefits. For instance, they foster teamwork, communication, and camaraderie among teammates. By working together towards a common goal, individuals develop essential life skills such as coordination, strategy, and mutual support. Moreover, group sports provide a social outlet, where one can make new friends and connections, which can lead to a stronger sense of community and belonging. In my experience, playing soccer with my school team taught me the value of cooperation and reliance on others, which has translated to other areas of my life.On the other hand, individual sports like tennis, swimming, and golf, also have their own set of advantages. They promote self-discipline, perseverance, and personal responsibility, as the individual is solely accountable for their performance. Additionally, individual sports allow for greater flexibility and autonomy, as one can practice and compete at their own pace. Personally, I have found that playing tennis has helped me develop a stronger sense of self-reliance and time management, as I have to balance my practice schedule with other commitments.However, both group and individual sports have their drawbacks. Group sports can be intimidating for beginners, and may lead to conflicts among teammates. Conversely, individual sports can be isolating and may lead to burnout, if one is not careful to balance their practice routine. Nevertheless, the benefits of both group and individual sports far outweigh the disadvantages, and I firmly believe that participating in either, or both, can have a profoundly positive impact on one's physical, emotional, and social well-being.
189;Write about the following topic.Some people think that we should divide students based on their academic ability, while others think we should educate all students together. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people argue that students who have noticeable abilities and nice educational skills in academics should be separated during the learning process. The other says that it is no object who a better in education who not they should study together. I believe that it is terrible idea to include separation among students.On the one hand, when students with strong and weak academic abilities educate separately, teachers could control the learning process more thoroughly. In this way the teacher could give them more difficult tasks and focus on really relevant topics. A good example of this are private schools with fees and entering exams. It is the fact that there students in final classes have better knowledge than in common schools.On the other hand, when students with different skills educate together the strong students will help weak ones. In these classes there are standards and all students should follow them and there are opportunities to ask schoolmates how to solve some task correctly. The nice example of this is my school. If I did not know how to solve a task I would have a chance to wait for help from my more wise mate.In conclusion, although separate education will give a chance to learn a lot of difficult tasks and it helps teachers, the losing way of asking help if you do not know how to solve the task would be devastating for the educational process. In addition, it could be separated by abilities and wisdom, anyway it is an awful idea.;The debate over whether students with exceptional abilities and academic skills should be separated from their peers during the learning process has sparked intense discussion. On one hand, some people argue that separating gifted students from the rest would allow them to reach their full potential, as they would be taught at a pace and level that is tailored to their needs. This approach, proponents claim, would prevent these students from being held back by their less academically inclined classmates.On the other hand, there is a compelling argument that suggests that students with varying skills and abilities should learn together. This inclusive approach allows strong students to act as role models and mentors for their weaker peers. When students with different skills learn together, a collaborative and supportive environment is fostered, where the strong students can help their weaker counterparts. This not only benefits the weaker students, who receive individualized attention and guidance, but also the stronger students, who develop important skills such as communication, empathy, and leadership.Moreover, educating students with diverse skills together promotes a sense of community and socialization, which is essential for personal growth and development. By interacting with students of varying abilities, students learn to appreciate and value differences, and develop a more nuanced understanding of the world around them. Furthermore, this approach prepares students for real-world scenarios, where they will be working with people of diverse skills and backgrounds.In conclusion, while separating gifted students may seem like a viable option, the benefits of educating students with different skills together far outweigh the advantages of separation. By learning together, students develop essential life skills, such as teamwork, communication, and empathy, and are better prepared to succeed in an increasingly complex and diverse world.
569;Write about the following topic.Some teachers think that international student exchange would be beneficial for all teenage school students.Do you think its advantages will outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The international student exchange is getting more popular in many high schools in big cities. This operation brings many advantages which would be beneficial for teenager students. Though, here some disadvantages still exist.Firstly, I think one of disadvantages is that lack of supervision on the international exchange teenagers as they are living in other countries. In general speaking, the youths felt strange and inadaptable at initial period. They can’t speak well foreign language, can’t communicate well with other classmates or teachers, so they might feel alone and isolate from a new circumstance. If they can’t adjust themselves well to fit in with groups as soon as possible, they will encounter more difficult things, such as studying, social and daily routine. The worse situation is that they might give up their studying, even they will mislead them into crime.On the contrary, the advantages are far more than disadvantages. For example, youths will extend their horizons. They will see and know many new things what they never seen in domestic. They would easily accept those new things than adults, because youths have curiosities all long. Furthermore, the teenagers easier to make new friends in other countries, because they are always passion and single-minded. In order to communicate with different background students from all over the world, they must cultivate their social capacities harder than before. It is the best way to elevate their skills of the foreign language is communication. Moreover, through the different viewpoint collisions the international exchange students have gained multiple and scientific logics, which will have a profound impact at the rest their lives. However, I think the simplest advantage is that most the international exchange students have possessed with an excellent foreign language ability after then come back.At the end of my essay, I think it is not suit for all teenagers to be the international exchange students. Here the teenagers must accept some selection processes under the fair and effective principles.;The international student exchange program has gained immense popularity in many high schools located in big cities. This operation has numerous benefits that can be highly advantageous for teenager students. The primary advantage of this program is that it provides students with a unique opportunity to experience different cultures, traditions, and ways of life. By living with a host family in a foreign country, students can immerse themselves in a new language, learn about customs and values, and develop a broader perspective on the world.Another significant benefit of international student exchange is that it helps students develop essential life skills such as independence, self-reliance, and adaptability. Living away from home and navigating unfamiliar environments can be challenging, but it also fosters personal growth, resilience, and confidence. Moreover, students can develop valuable friendships and connections with people from diverse backgrounds, which can be beneficial for their future academic and professional pursuits.On the contrary, some may argue that international student exchange programs have disadvantages, such as homesickness, language barriers, and cultural shocks. However, these disadvantages are far outweighed by the numerous advantages that this program offers. In fact, many students who participate in international student exchange programs report that the benefits they gained, such as improved language skills, cultural competence, and self-awareness, have had a lasting impact on their lives.In conclusion, international student exchange programs are an invaluable opportunity for high school students to gain a unique educational experience, develop essential life skills, and broaden their perspectives on the world. While there may be some challenges associated with this program, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages, making it an highly rewarding and enriching experience for teenager students. As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, participating in international student exchange programs can be a valuable investment in a student's future, preparing them to become global citizens, leaders, and change-makers.

From my perspective, such a trend contains much benefits and it is undoubtedly a positive development.On the one hand, people can have more access to their interested expertise and delve into related fields with the help of online courses offered by universities. It is comparatively hard and inconvenient for people to attend courses in the university if they are not college students. Luckily, with myriads of online courses which are usually free and of high quality, learners merely need to register and sign in to find out some interesting courses ranging from academic knowledge to practical skills, which can afford a challenging but exciting experience for those attend the lessons.On the other hand, it is a good way for the universities to improve the quality of the courses as well as make some adaptation to the content of the courses. In order for people outside the universities to acquire knowldege effectively, online courses should cater to people's preference to some extent. It is expectable that some courses which is of great necessity and closely connected with people's daily life would be popular. Thus, universities would therefore release more high-quality courses by innovating teaching skills to meet people's needs.In conlusion, I think online courses provided by universities can surely make a positive impact on society because people who have the desire to acquire knowledge can enjoy sufficient resources without boundaries, which enhances individual's rights to grasp knowledge and facilitates the improvement of higher education in the long run.;The advent of online courses offered by universities has revolutionized the way people acquire knowledge.

531;Write about the following topic.The issue of gay marriage remains controversial. Some people think that this trend has adverse effects on the society while others believe that it is seen as a natural trend and right for people to choose this type of marriage. Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Recently, many countries have legalized gay marriage. However, there are many people who do not agree with that, and claim that it has a bad influence on the education of children, and the evolution of society. However, in my opinion, I think it is a good opportunity for homosexual people as they are now understood by others, and have the right to have children despite of their situation.To begin, there are many parents, for example, who tend to believe that because of the access to gay marriage, their children will find it normal to fall in love with a person from the same sex. As a result, more and more children will become homosexual, which is unconventional as far as the parents are concerned. However, I believe that it is not because children understand the fact that being gay is normal, that they will be influenced by this. In fact, they will be able to compassionate for people who struggle to express their homosexuality, so they will help them to feel more comfortable with that. Moreover, they will be more open-minded which is very important for children development.Secondly, many other people are convinced that gay marriage will inevitably tends towards a decrease of the young population as gay individuals can not have their own kids. As a consequence, This phenomenon represents a threat because young people will not be able to take over for the future. However, I am not of this opinion. I think that such a decrease in young people population will not occur as the vast majority of the world's population in not homosexual. Moreover, by allowing gay marriage, gay couples will be able to adopt children. Indeed, due to the fact that they are not able to give rise to new-born, they can adopt children who are abandonned, and give them the opportunity to live in a new family with good conditions.To conclude, I firmly believe that gay marriage is a good opportunity for the development of the society. Indeed, not only it makes children more open-minded, which is important for their own development, but also gives for those who are unfortunately abandonned, a safe environment to thrive in.;The legalization of gay marriage has marked a significant milestone in the fight for equality and understanding of homosexual individuals. This development has not only provided a sense of validation and recognition to the LGBTQ+ community but has also opened up new avenues for them to build families. With the advent of gay marriage, homosexual couples now have the opportunity to adopt children, thereby starting their own families. This is a testament to the progress society has made in accepting and embracing diversity.However, the concern among some parents that the normalization of gay marriage might influence their children's sexual orientation is misplaced. The notion that children will be more likely to identify as gay because they see gay marriage as normal oversimplifies the complex nature of sexual orientation. Sexual orientation is not a choice but rather an inherent aspect of a person's identity. The visibility and acceptance of gay relationships can indeed help reduce stigma and make it easier for young people to be honest about their feelings, but it does not influence their underlying orientation.In fact, the acceptance of gay marriage and the visibility of gay couples can have a positive impact on all children, regardless of their sexual orientation. It teaches them about respect, acceptance, and the importance of loving relationships, regardless of the gender of the people involved. By understanding and embracing diversity, children learn valuable lessons about inclusivity and the spectrum of human experience. Therefore, rather than being a cause for concern, the recognition of gay marriage should be seen as an opportunity to foster a more compassionate and inclusive society for everyone.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many today have come to the conclusion that the most significant effect on people of music is to relieve stress. While I agree that music also has more important positive functions other than reducing stress.On the one hand, I have to admit that music is a good way to reduce stress and it do plays an important role in our daily life. A good example of this can be seen in Shanghai, where has a large number of single karaoke rooms in the office buildings. As we all know, compared to the others cities in China, the people living in Shanghai face more stress, like the surprisingly high price of house and the fierce competition of work. Those public karaoke rooms, which were provided by the government for the public, become a good place for people to enjoy the music and have fun.On the other hand, for many people, music is an ideal career to persue in their life, like the job as an accountant, which can bring them with incomes and improve their living standard. For example, the TV programs related to music attract more and more people to participate in, like The Voice. Most of the participants wish to show their excellent peformance in music through these stages with the purpose of having access to more business opportunities and making more money at the same time. It is undeniable that the following income would be exponential increased than before if they succeed finally.In conclusion, it is not doubt that music is very essential for us, not only for its spiritual meanings, but also for its more important role in our society which could allow the person to relise their dream while creating more economical benefits.;"The Impact of Music on Society: Beyond Stress ReliefMany people today have come to the conclusion that the most significant effect of music on individuals is to relieve stress.

Additionally, music has been shown to have a positive impact on mental and physical health, with studies indicating that it can improve cognitive function, reduce anxiety and depression, and even alleviate symptoms of chronic illnesses. In conclusion, while music is indeed an effective tool for stress relief, its impact on society extends far beyond this benefit, and its importance cannot be overstated."

Finding solutions to reduce traffic is very crucial. I totally agree that if people travel less from home to work or to education or even for shopping can reduce the amount of traffic. With the covid 19 outbreak pandemic we saw how much the working from home and using the zoom application for studying reduced the traffic in cities. People now are using online for shopping too. We know that traffic can be reduced if less consumers are using the roads. However, I dont agree that this is the only way to reduce traffic. Other strategies to reduce traffic are :1. Planning the roads and building the road bridges in a smarter way with special lanes for public transportation.2. Encourging people to use light trails, public transportations and to use car pools.3. Building special lanes for motorcycles and electric bikes.4. The governoment can put more regulations regarding how many cars each family can have.5. Increasing the vehicles prices and reduce the public transportation tickets.6. Educate people on the consequences of traffic and how it can inadverntly affect their life.7. Encourge people to walk more and to choose a work that is close to your home.As I mentioned above there are many strategies that can help in reducing tranffic and only by reducing the need for people to travel from home. I think i people travel less it abviously can reduce the traffic but we need a multi strategy with the collaberations of many sectors to successfly reduce traffic in cities.;The ever-increasing traffic in cities has now become a major public health problem. The congestion on roads is not only causing frustration and wasting valuable time, but also posing serious health risks to citizens. The air pollution emitted by vehicles is a significant contributor to respiratory diseases, while the noise pollution is leading to increased stress levels and other mental health issues. Therefore, finding solutions to reduce traffic is very crucial to mitigate these adverse effects.One potential solution to alleviate traffic congestion is to reduce the need for daily commutes. I totally agree that if people travel less from home to work or to education, it can significantly reduce the amount of traffic on the roads. By adopting flexible work arrangements, such as telecommuting or flexible hours, people can minimize their daily travels. Similarly, schools and educational institutions can also explore online learning platforms to reduce the need for students to commute to schools. This not only reduces traffic but also provides students with more flexibility and comfort while learning.Moreover, cities can also invest in public transportation systems, such as buses, trains, and subways, to encourage people to use shared modes of transport rather than private vehicles. By providing efficient, reliable, and affordable public transportation, people can be incentivized to leave their cars behind, thereby reducing traffic congestion. Additionally, cities can also promote non-motorized transport, such as cycling and walking, by building dedicated bike lanes and pedestrian paths. This not only reduces traffic but also promotes physical activity and a healthier lifestyle.In conclusion, reducing traffic in cities requires a multi-faceted approach. By reducing the need for daily commutes, investing in public transportation, and promoting non-motorized transport, we can significantly alleviate traffic congestion and mitigate its adverse effects on public health. It is essential that policymakers, urban planners, and citizens work together to find innovative solutions to this pressing problem and create a healthier, more sustainable, and livable urban environment.
235;Write about the following topic.There are several factors that motivate people to stay in the workforce, and money is the most important reason/factor. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The topic of motivation for work has merely failed to be discussed. Someone elaborate that the most significant factor is money while others suppose it is not. As far as I am concerned, although money is of great importance, it cannot always be the most valuable one.Undoubtedly, money can be a crucial factor to diminish the financial burden of families, especially for those who were born in a poverty-stricken area. To be more specific, only by earning sufficient money can they raise their later generations and keep the elderly. Provided that they cannot find a decent job that allow them to own some disposable money, it would add insult to injury.However, there are a great number of factors that may be considered as worthwhile to be the motivation of stay in the staff by some people. First of all, being in the workforce can help to strengthen an individual’s interpersonal skills. It is widely acknowledged that there are a colossal number of activities as well as team programmes that require people to collaborate, compromise and compete with the others. Thus, individuals will tend to learn some social skills and become gregarious and sociable, which can help them better adapt themselves to the mainstream society. In addition, people may also get a chance to broaden their horizons and lay a firm basis for future development by staying in the workforce. For instance, under the circumstance that numerous companies may provide the staff with the opportunity to go abroad and get involved in some international programs, people are able to get access to different cultures. As a result, people can develop panning-for-gold thinking rather than sponge-feeding thinking in the process of understanding divergent cultures, which can be beneficial for their future careers.In conclusion, although money is valuable for individuals to be in the workforce, there are many other factors that cannot be overlooked. Only by treating all the factors rationally can we enjoy the pleasure rather than pressure.;The Role of Money and Personal Growth in the WorkforceMoney is often considered a significant motivator for individuals to join and remain in the workforce. For many families, it can be a crucial factor in diminishing the financial burden, allowing them to maintain a stable and secure lifestyle. However, money is not the only driving force behind an individual's decision to stay in the workforce. There are numerous other factors that can be equally, if not more, motivating.Being part of the workforce offers a multitude of benefits that extend beyond financial gain. For instance, it provides an opportunity for individuals to strengthen their interpersonal skills. Interacting with colleagues, supervisors, and clients on a daily basis can significantly enhance one's ability to communicate effectively, resolve conflicts, and work as part of a team. These skills are not only valuable in a professional setting but also in personal relationships and community engagements.Furthermore, participation in the workforce can be a catalyst for personal growth and development. It offers a platform for individuals to broaden their horizons, both professionally and personally. Through work-related training, workshops, and conferences, individuals can acquire new skills, stay updated with the latest trends and technologies in their field, and explore different areas of interest. This exposure can lead to a more fulfilling career and a greater sense of accomplishment. Additionally, the diverse environment of the workforce can expose individuals to different cultures, perspectives, and ways of thinking, fostering a more open-minded and adaptable individual.In conclusion, while money is a vital aspect of why people choose to work, it is by no means the only motivator. The opportunity to enhance interpersonal skills and broaden one's horizons are significant factors that motivate individuals to stay in the workforce. These aspects not only contribute to professional success but also to personal growth and satisfaction, making the decision to be part of the workforce a worthwhile and rewarding experience.

However, some people believe that insects are not only unhealthy but harvesting them will also negatively affect nature. What are the benefits and drawbacks of eating insects?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some countries and culture already utilize insects as part of food source. As such, it can be relatively inexpensive to consume insects - which are often freely found in certain environments and do not take much skill to be collected, killed and consumed - as compared to the cost and manual labor involved in raising animal livestock, butchering, as well as preparing the meat for consumption. Similarly agriculture also involves consistent manual labor, and has costs associated with it, including for machinery and materials needed. However, people may be against the idea of consuming insects due to the novelty of it, and they may also feel disgust around it. As the prompt states, some may find it unhealthy. Harvesting insects on purpose will also require some physical and psychological work - but the benefit here is that it may be easier than harvesting large animals or cultivating crops.I have never consumed an insect product - and my father has mentioned to me that had lived in such-and-such country, I would not be so scared of cockroaches - viewing them as a food source. He intended this to be an ironic comment, meant to comfor me somewhat due to my strong aversion to cockroaches. However, he may be correct! For individuals socialized in such a society, their aversion to roaches may be lower than mine. Hence, part of the issue here is socialization and accepting this new food norm, should it be novel to the individual and/or the country.I have tried an octopus for the first time when I was around 20 years old - as I was curious about this dish called Takoyaki, and had heard good reviews of it. It was not unpleasant to eat the ocotpus, per se, but I likely will not go back to it. All in all, new experiences, including consumption of new types of food, may create strong aversion at first, but once dip your toes into it, so to speak, it may be tamer than the experience you were expecting - even if you never go back to eating it again.;The concept of entomophagy, or the practice of consuming insects as a food source, has been met with resistance by many individuals. One of the primary reasons for this aversion is the novelty of the idea. For those who have not been exposed to insect consumption in their daily lives, the thought of eating insects can be unsettling and even disgusting. This reaction is deeply rooted in socialization, as people tend to adhere to the food norms that they have been accustomed to since childhood. The idea of consuming insects challenges these deeply ingrained norms, leading to a natural resistance to the concept.Furthermore, some individuals may also view insect consumption as unhealthy, which can further exacerbate their reluctance to adopt this new food source. This perception may stem from a lack of understanding about the nutritional benefits of insects, which are rich in protein, fiber, and micronutrients. However, the perceived health risks associated with consuming insects can be a significant barrier to overcome, especially in countries or cultures where this practice is not common.The issue of socialization and acceptance is particularly relevant when considering the introduction of insect consumption in new regions or to individuals who have not been exposed to it before. If the concept is novel to the individual and/or country, it can be even more challenging to gain widespread acceptance. Nevertheless, it is essential to recognize the potential benefits of entomophagy, including its sustainability and nutritional value. By educating people about the advantages of insect consumption and gradually introducing it into their diets, it may be possible to shift societal norms and increase acceptance of this unconventional food source. Ultimately, a nuanced approach that takes into account the social, cultural, and nutritional aspects of insect consumption is necessary to overcome the initial resistance and make entomophagy a more mainstream practice.

So they could contributed more for any pension plan or those kind of program. We need to guarantee that our next governants will be capable to redesign the retire's program in an way to guarantee those beneffits to whole population.Looking by a health care perspective, all the improvments and medicine advance, it brings the possibilite to have a good life even allthough the years.For instance, we can see many people that healed from a bad ill like cancer or other ones and have a good life nowadays.This is the reason that elderly people is not a problem to our society, but in fact their represents more knowledge and we have all tecnology to take care about theirselfs.In other way we can see that our society open more space and are more concern with elderly population. We can see some places speciallyzed to take care of their and also a kind of intertainement focused on them, like some hotels, restauurants, clinics.In whole way our society are looking for treaty our elderly society in a decent way, respect them, make a enviroment friendly for their deficient and any dificult of mobility and any other issue that we need to cope to guarantee their activities.;The advancements in healthcare have led to a significant increase in the number of elderly people in the population. As medical technology and treatments continue to improve, people are living longer and healthier lives. I firmly believe that these improvements in healthcare are not only increasing the lifespan of individuals, but also bringing numerous benefits in the way we care for them.From a healthcare perspective, the advancements in medicine and technology have opened up new possibilities for the elderly to live fulfilling lives. With the development of new treatments and medications, age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's are being managed more effectively, allowing elderly individuals to maintain their independence and quality of life. Furthermore, the improvements in healthcare have also led to a reduction in disability rates among the elderly, enabling them to remain active and engaged in their communities.The benefits of these improvements in healthcare are multifaceted. Not only do they enable elderly individuals to live longer and healthier lives, but they also bring economic benefits, as elderly individuals are able to continue contributing to society through volunteer work, mentoring, and other activities. Additionally, the advancements in healthcare have led to a shift in the way we care for the elderly, with a greater emphasis on preventative care, rehabilitation, and palliative care. This approach focuses on maintaining the physical and mental well-being of elderly individuals, enabling them to age with dignity and respect.In conclusion, while the improvements in healthcare may increase the number of elderly people, they also bring numerous benefits in the way we care for them. By providing elderly individuals with access to better healthcare, we are enabling them to live fulfilling and meaningful lives, and to continue contributing to society in meaningful ways. As we continue to advance in the field of healthcare, it is likely that we will see even more innovative approaches to caring for the elderly, and enabling them to live happy, healthy, and productive lives.
933;Write about the following topic.Young people in the modern world seem to have more power and influence than any previous young generation.Why is this the case?What impact does this have on the relationship between old and young people?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"In modern times, the younger generation appear to be more powerful and influencial compared to the generations in times past. I believe this is as a result of younger people being more ascertive, stepping up to question and change existing societal norms and archaic cultures. At first, this may negatively affect their relationship with the older generation as a result of how unfamiliar they are to these changes but subsequently, the tension is bound to resolve, when the older generations come to accept these changes.To begin with, it is an open truth that young people these days tend to be very bold and outspoken and unlike their predecessors, are better at questioning norms that do not sit right with them and even going an extra mile to change these norms or cultures. A good example of this is seen in women empowerment and rights activism. In my part of the world, some years back, it was believed that a woman's place is in the kitchen and her sole job was to birth and rear children, therefore, women were not allowed to be educated or have paying jobs. Women in the older generation complied to this because it was the norm, but this is not the case in modern times, because many young women opposed to it and now, homes are even headed by women; the power of activism.Many people in the older generation are not familiar with young people being more outspoken and this is understandable because in their time, they were taught to only follow rules and not to question them. Therefore the fact that young people have become more outspoken and powerful is foreign to them and just like every human nature, whatever is foreign or different is automatically hated. As a result, there is likely going to be a tension between the 2 generations, however, with constant advocation and learning the tension is bound to resolve. For example, going back to women's rights activism, at the start, many older people were not on board as they did not think it was normal, however, there are now a lot of older people who have become activists.In conclusion, I believe that the power and influence the younger generation has is as a result of their ascertiveness and will to effect changes in their societies and even though it may cause a negative relationship with the older generation at first, subsequently, their differences is likely to be ironed out when the older generation learns to accept these changes.";The dynamics of power and influence have undergone a significant shift in modern times. Unlike in the past, when age and experience were the primary determinants of authority, the younger generation has emerged as a force to be reckoned with. In my opinion, this phenomenon can be attributed to the growing assertiveness of young people, who are no longer hesitant to question and challenge existing societal norms and outdated cultural practices.This newfound boldness has enabled the younger generation to bring about much-needed changes, pushing the boundaries of what is considered acceptable and driving progress in various spheres of life. However, this shift in power dynamics has not been without its challenges. The older generation, who are often unfamiliar with these changes, may view them with skepticism and even resistance. This can lead to tension and conflict between the two generations, as the older generation struggles to adapt to the new realities. Nevertheless, I believe that this tension is a necessary step towards progress and ultimately, it will resolve with time. As the younger generation continues to advocate for their values and beliefs, and as the older generation engages with them in open and honest dialogue, the gap between them will begin to narrow. Through constant learning and education, the older generation will come to understand and appreciate the perspectives of the younger generation, and the two will find common ground. Ultimately, the empowerment of the younger generation will be recognized as a positive force for change, driving society forward and creating a brighter future for all. By embracing this shift in power dynamics, we can harness the energy and idealism of the younger generation to build a more just, equitable, and progressive world.
351;Write about the following topic:In many countries, not enough students study science subjects. What are the causes? What will be the effect on society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, there are many courses available to take, from arts that include theatre and music to scientific topics such as mathemathics, physics, chemistry, biology and medicine. There is an evidence that the amount of students willing to learn science subjects is not sufficient. In this essay I will discuss the causes of the issue and the possible effect on society.There are several casues for the fact that students tend to skip science subjects. First, studying science can be hard and exhausting. The complexity of some subjects such as math and physics requires from the student to study many hours at home. Secondly, there are students who do not only find those courses difficult, but also get low marks even after studying long hours. As for chemistry classes, some courses include labratory lessons which may not appeal to some students.The importance of people having knowledge in science is great. The society relies on science on a daily basis. For instance, doctors who study medicine, must know mathematics, biology and chemistry well, because biology is relevant to the patient's body. In addition, doctors prescribe medications so they must know chemistry well. Another example is architects whose job is to plan and design buildings. Without a proper knowledge in physics, they could not plan buildings.Discussing those facts, studying science can be challenging. However, it is vital for the society that students will study science. Without doctors, nurses, scientists and other professions that rely on science, the health of the society might be effected negatively.;The pursuit of scientific knowledge is essential for the progress and development of societies. However, there is growing evidence that the number of students willing to learn science subjects is not sufficient. This trend is alarming and warrants an examination of the underlying causes. Upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that there are several reasons why students tend to shy away from science subjects.First and foremost, studying science can be a daunting and exhausting task. The complexity and abstract nature of scientific concepts often require a significant amount of time and effort to grasp. As a result, many students find themselves overwhelmed by the sheer volume of material to be covered, leading to a decline in interest and motivation. The rigorous demands of science courses can be intimidating, causing some students to opt for less demanding subjects.Furthermore, the difficulty of science subjects is compounded by the fact that some students, despite dedicating long hours to studying, still manage to achieve low marks. This can be a significant deterrent, as the perception of inefficacy can lead to frustration and disillusionment. When students invest considerable time and effort into studying, only to receive poor grades, it can be disheartening and may lead them to question their ability to succeed in science. This vicious cycle of difficulty and disappointment can ultimately drive students away from pursuing science subjects, thereby perpetuating the shortage of interested learners. It is essential to address these challenges and make science more accessible and engaging for students, in order to foster a greater interest and appreciation for scientific knowledge.
1185;Write about the following topic:Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Poverty has been always a major issue around the world. Due to viruses, natural disasters, and poor management in the country and overpopulation, each day the poverty increases. In addition, some developed countries ignore the help or just give a temporary solution. Poverty has a great effect on the income that can lead to serious problems.To begin with, developed countries shouldn't only support with financial aid, as that kind of solution will not help the people. In my opinion, rich countries can stop poverty in such way to look for the natural resources of the poor country and to help and develop its resources. For example, in Africa they are famous for their large area of land. A rich country can take this opportunity to implement a long-term plan to benefit and fight poverty, such as to start expanding the lands of agriculture to use their natural resources such as cocoa, rice, and coffee. Furthermore, this idea can also help the people of the country where they can work on the land and be employed.Also, developed countries can donate and build health care centers and schools to prevent the dangerous disease from spreading. Schools can empower children to grow up and help the country's economy to rise and to fight poverty.In conclusion, developed countries can unite and discuss this significant concern rather than helping with financial support as poverty is taking the lives of many children. Poor countries just need better solutions and understanding from the world to prevent such problems from continuing to happen.;Poverty has been a perennial issue plaguing societies worldwide. The scourge of poverty is further exacerbated by the advent of viruses, natural disasters, and poor governance in many countries. As a result, the poverty gap continues to widen with each passing day. In my opinion, rich countries have a pivotal role to play in mitigating poverty in impoverished nations.One effective way to address poverty is for rich countries to collaborate with poor countries to harness and develop their natural resources. Many poor countries are endowed with an abundance of natural resources, including minerals, forests, and water sources. However, due to lack of financial and technical capabilities, these resources often remain underutilized or unexploited. Rich countries, with their advanced technology and expertise, can assist poor countries in extracting, processing, and marketing these resources, thereby generating revenue and creating employment opportunities.By doing so, rich countries can help poor countries to break the vicious cycle of poverty and set them on a path of sustainable development. Moreover, this cooperation can also foster economic growth, improve living standards, and reduce income inequalities in poor countries. Furthermore, it can also help to reduce migration and brain drain from poor to rich countries, as people will have better opportunities in their home countries.In conclusion, poverty is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted approach to resolve. Rich countries have a moral obligation to assist poor countries in overcoming poverty. By helping poor countries to develop their natural resources, rich countries can make a significant contribution to poverty reduction and sustainable development. It is time for the international community to come together and find solutions to this pressing issue, and make a poverty-free world a reality.
343;Write about the following topic:Some people believe that it is important to spend a lot of money on family celebrations. While others think it is a waste of money. Discuss both views.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Spending money in family celebrations can be seen as a way of appreciating where one comes from. Although some people say it is a total waste of money, l assert that it is wiser.To begin with, many people feel that it is of no importance to consume money on family gatherings. This is because people usually have more pressing issues in life like urgent health cases that require money. Also, some struggle to provide basic needs for their families, for example, tuitions, decent meals and shelter. For these reasons, it seems using money on family gatherings is just a luxury.Despite the merits of the arguments above, although many say it is wasteful to financially cater for family parties, l assert that it is crucial. One reason is that, it unites families and a sweet spirit is maintained if family members are recognised for their special days such as wedding anniversaries, birthdays and graduations where money is spent. Further, appreciation to others within the family cannot be expressed in many ways without forking out some money.Furthermore, money has to be spent on family get togethers where everyone is in a joyous mood so that people can catch up and release stresses from their straining personal lives. What is more, culture, closeness and love is easily displayed when families come together for such celebrations and use money for their own satisfaction. For instance, when my childhood birthdays were celebrated, l felt so much loved and l still cherish the memories as l vividly can recall.To conclude, although others feel that it is money consuming to fund family gatherings, l advocate that it is a wiser option. Should this be the case, love within families would not wax cold and family members would feel more appreciated.;The age-old debate about the value of spending money on family celebrations has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that it is a frivolous waste of resources, I firmly believe that it is a wise investment. Spending money on family celebrations is not just about indulging in extravagance, but rather a thoughtful way of appreciating one's roots and heritage.By allocating funds to celebrate special occasions such as birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries, we demonstrate our gratitude and respect for our family's history and traditions. These events provide a unique opportunity to come together, strengthen bonds, and create lasting memories. When family members feel recognized and appreciated on their special days, it fosters a sense of belonging and unity. The joy and love shared during these celebrations can have a profound impact on our emotional and mental well-being, ultimately leading to a more harmonious and supportive family environment.Moreover, family celebrations offer a chance to honor and acknowledge the contributions and sacrifices made by our loved ones. By showing our appreciation through thoughtful gestures and gifts, we reinforce the values of love, respect, and gratitude that are essential to a strong and resilient family. In contrast, neglecting these celebrations can lead to feelings of neglect and isolation, ultimately damaging the fabric of our family relationships.In conclusion, spending money on family celebrations is a wise decision that yields long-term benefits. It is an investment in the well-being and happiness of our loved ones, and a meaningful way to express our appreciation for our family's love and support. By prioritizing these special occasions, we can nurture a sense of unity, love, and gratitude that will be passed down to future generations.

Discuss both views and state your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;International sports events are one of the most trendy interactions at any hosting country. Depending on the hoster, the events could represent a virtue or a slip. This dependence is associated with the costs, logisitcs, marketing, etc. I tend to be of the opinion, that the virtues outweigh the disadvantages and that they shall be considered as opportunities to exploit.Some people think of the international sport events as being disadvantageous, because for example of being a pressure on the countries' infrastructure as well as the provided services and facilities. Another reason might emerge as some countries also might not be well-suited for such events. For instance, despite spending a big budget on the organisation of the event, the lack of qualified personnel or needed objects and materials shall cause a massive distruction of the hostees' experiences.The other perpective of the usages and utilization of such events could be clear through the massive amount of virtues, which these events normally brings to the hosting countries. For example, these events are regularly sponsored from international organisation, which provide the financial means not for only the logisitcs of the events, but additionally fees for the hosters. Furthermore, the financial benefits shall not stop by the provided fees through the owning organisation, but also the global or regional branding of such country will affect the tourism and the local service providers absolutely positive.Concluding, international sport events could be absolutely virtous, if the hosting countries were to implement their strategies successfully. Should such countries be willing to give the event the raw focus on the organisation and the user-experience, that would absolutely lead to massive benefits financially, marketing-wise and from intercultural perspective.;International sport events have become a significant phenomenon in modern times, attracting millions of spectators and participants from around the globe. These events, such as the Olympics, the World Cup, and the Commonwealth Games, are often considered a benchmark of a country's prestige and reputation. As a hosting country, these events can either represent a virtue or a slip, depending on the host's ability to organize and execute them successfully.On one hand, hosting international sport events can be a slip if not managed properly. The massive investment required to build and maintain infrastructure, accommodate athletes and spectators, and ensure security can be a significant burden on the host country's economy. Moreover, the event can also be marred by controversies, scandals, and logistical issues, which can tarnish the host country's image.On the other hand, I firmly believe that the virtues of hosting international sport events outweigh the disadvantages. These events have the power to unite people, promote cultural exchange, and foster global understanding. They also provide a unique opportunity for the host country to showcase its rich culture, history, and natural beauty to a global audience. Furthermore, the investment in infrastructure and amenities can have a long-term positive impact on the host country's economy and tourism industry.Additionally, international sport events can also promote social and economic development, particularly in developing countries. They can create jobs,.and stimulate local economies, while also promoting social cohesion and national pride. In conclusion, while there are potential risks and challenges associated with hosting international sport events, I firmly believe that the virtues outweigh the disadvantages. With careful planning, execution, and management, these events can be a resounding success, promoting global unity, cultural exchange, and economic development.

1377;should children grow up in the city or countryside (advantages/disadvantages)?;Some people think it is better for children to grown up in the city, while others think that life in the countryside is more suitable for them. What are the advantages and disadvantages of both places?Living in the rural area is the best option for children by a group of people, while others believe that cities offer more opportunities. In my opinion, if the city offers security and green areas, I agree it is a better place to raise the next generation some advantages both sides.Firstly, the countryside in touch with nature, taking care of animals and helping with the gardening. Because of that, they learn how to protect the environment and to live without any technological equipment. Besides that, they have more freedom to play outside the house without any security worries, whereas in the city they are kept at home smartphones and computers for this reason. On the other hand, schools usually have lower quality and it is hard to find extracurricular classes. Therefore, children difficulties trying to develop their abilities besides the school curriculum.However, schools at metropolitan areas tend to have better quality and offer all kinds of activities. Even if there is a sport or an art course that the institution does not offer, it is possible to look for it in another place around the city. As a result, all children’s talents and passions can be easier to develop. On the other hand, security, pollution and contact with nature are issues that we have to worry about. The better option would be a city with an excellent quality of life where children could play in parks and gardens.To sum up, growing up in the countryside can be very positive for someone’s childhood, but the city will usually offer better opportunities for their talents’ development.This is a well written essay. It talks about all parts of the task and the arguments and ideas are extended and supported by some examples. The information is sequenced in a logical way and most of the ideas are linked using appropriate connective words.

Overall this essay seems good enough to deserve IELTS Band 8.;The debate about whether children should grow up in the city or the countryside has been ongoing for years. While some people believe that the city is the ideal place for children to grow, others argue that the countryside is more suitable. Both places have their advantages and disadvantages, which are crucial to consider when making a decision.On the one hand, growing up in the countryside has numerous benefits for children. For instance, they get to be in touch with nature, taking care of animals, and helping with gardening. This not only teaches them valuable life skills but also instills in them a sense of responsibility. Additionally, children in the countryside have more freedom to play outside without any security worries, which is essential for their physical and mental development. The peaceful and serene environment of the countryside also provides a unique opportunity for children to connect with nature and develop a deeper appreciation for the environment.On the other hand, there are some drawbacks to growing up in the countryside. One of the major disadvantages is that schools usually have lower quality, which can hinder a child's academic development. Furthermore, it is hard to find extracurricular classes, which are essential for a child's overall development. This can limit a child's opportunities to explore their interests and talents, which can have long-term consequences on their career choices and personal growth.In conclusion, both the city and the countryside have their advantages and disadvantages when it comes to raising children. While the countryside offers a unique opportunity for children to connect with nature and develop valuable life skills, it lacks in terms of quality education and extracurricular activities. Ultimately, the decision of where to raise children depends on what parents value most for their child's development and well-being.
917;‘Failure is proof that the desire wasn’t strong enough’To what extent do you agree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Failure is what nobody wish for, but it could occur secondarily to an unsuccessful attempt towards ones goal, for various reasons. I am in the view that, failure is not a proof of lack of desire, rather it is more to do with improper techniques, less allocation of time and lack of proper attitude.It is the general view that, ultimate success in any field is taught through the failures in life. One can be subjected to multiple failures due to lack of ability to develop essential skill set, also known as techniques, that would be essential to achieve a certain goal. One classic example is Thomas Alwa Eddison, the great inventor of all time, who went through nearly 100 unsucessfull experiments, before inventing the light bulb. He was brave enough to accept the failure experiments had taught him 100 different impossible ways not to discover the light bulb.On the other hand, time plays one of the most crucial factors in obtaining a goal/success. By this I meant, the time that is allocated towards full filling tasks that are directed towards preparing for the goal. The little time is spent during the preparation, the further away the goal felt like. For an instance, one cannot expected to win a marothon with just one day preparation.Similarly, attitude plays by far the most striking part of the success. This is simple as, one cannot dream of becoming a good physician, having shown no interest in paying attention to people and their health related complaints.In a nut shell, failure is not a proof for inadequate desire in fact, failure is due to improper practices of techniques,failure of managing time in preparing and attitudes that fires the drive.;The concept of failure is often misconstrued as a reflection of one's desire or willingness to succeed. However, this notion is far from the truth. Failure is not a proof of lack of desire, but rather a result of improper techniques, inadequate allocation of time, and a lack of proper attitude. It is essential to recognize that failure is a common occurrence, even for individuals who are passionate and driven to achieve their goals.One of the primary reasons for failure is the lack of essential skill sets. Without developing the necessary skills, one can be subjected to multiple failures, regardless of their desire to succeed. This is because skills are the building blocks of success, and without them, even the most determined individual can falter. Furthermore, improper techniques and inadequate time allocation can also lead to failure. If one is using outdated or ineffective methods, they will likely struggle to achieve their goals, no matter how much they desire success.Additionally, a lack of proper attitude can also hinder success. A negative mindset, lack of resilience, and an inability to learn from mistakes can all contribute to failure. It is crucial to recognize that failure is not a reflection of one's character or desire, but rather an opportunity to learn and grow. By acknowledging the root causes of failure, such as improper techniques, lack of skill sets, and inadequate attitude, individuals can take the necessary steps to rectify these issues and work towards achieving their goals. Ultimately, it is not the desire that is lacking, but rather the approach and mindset that needs to be adjusted. With the right techniques, skills, and attitude, individuals can overcome failure and achieve success, regardless of their past experiences.

Therefore, some people think that the education system is the only important factor to the development of a country and they may be right.Education is the foundation of developed society.

Any country can become more technologically advanced and developed because of education.However, there are other factors that also play an important role in the development of a country. Such as governments have to encouraged people to do soIn conclusion, I would like to say that a good education system will lead to a developed country.;"The Role of Education in National DevelopmentEducation is widely regarded as a crucial factor in the development and prosperity of a country. The phrase ""education is a ladder to success"" aptly captures the significance of education in achieving individual and national goals. By providing individuals with knowledge, skills, and competencies, education empowers them to contribute meaningfully to the economy and society. This, in turn, drives national development and progress.One of the key benefits of education is its role in creating employment opportunities. An educated workforce is better equipped to secure jobs and create employment for others, thereby reducing the incidence of unemployment. Unemployment is a major challenge that many countries face, and it can have far-reaching consequences, including poverty, social unrest, and economic instability. By investing in education, a country can ensure that its workforce is skilled and employable, thereby minimizing the risk of unemployment and its associated problems.Furthermore, education has a multiplier effect on the economy. Educated individuals are more likely to start their own businesses, innovate, and create new opportunities, leading to economic growth and development. They are also more likely to make informed decisions about their health, environment, and civic engagement, leading to a more informed and participatory citizenry. In conclusion, education is indeed a ladder to success, not just for individuals but for countries as a whole. By prioritizing education, a country can unlock the potential of its citizens, drive economic growth, and achieve sustainable development. Therefore, it is imperative that governments and stakeholders recognize the vital role of education in national development and work towards creating a knowledgeable, skilled, and employable workforce."
