1095;A country becomes more interesting and develops more quickly when its population includes a mixture of nationalities.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is belived that countries are developing faster and become more inspiring when their populations consist of variety of people with different nationalities. In my opinion, it is very controversial question, but I believe that nations who are tolerant to others and friendly are able to succeed in constracting better world not only for themselves and their surroundings but also for future generations. In this essay, I will discuss both points of view about attractiveness and development of countries based on national diversity.On the one hand, people of different nationalities are hardly able to understand each other and can be impatient for people who have another nationalities, that can create difficulties in communication, making agreements, sovling of problems. For example, people with different backgrounds can strat arguing about better governmental constitutions and politics, religions, educational system, traditional and another types of medicine, and so on. It worths to mention that none of those people will be completely right, if they deside to show off their experience instead of accepting ideas of others and just giving advice. Moreover, some disputes can even lead to quarrels, but not to finding the better dessisions, that can influence on safety of people with different nationalities. So, for living peacefully and sharing some ideas of better developmental practice, people should first of all respect each other independantly of their nantionalities.On the other hand, people of various nationalities are able to create not only interesting and diverse community, but also share knowlege and experience in order to achieve the best results in countries' development. For achieving this, people should follow several basic rules, which are usually unwritten, but those mental and behavioral lows should be understood by everyone. Firstly, they should be tolerant to each other and accepting some differences. Secondly, they should be polite when they want to share their knowlege and experiences, not showing off. Thirdly, it would be wonderful if they are able to create international community where people can communicate and make friends. Last but not least, they should remember that their attitudes for each other influence on the world as a whole where they and their children live, so they should be responsible for their words and behavior.In conclusion, countries which managed to connect people of different nationalities and create a friendly surroundings, in my opinion, are able to develope faster and look like fascinating diverse community which consist of people of various backgrounds.;It is believed that countries with diverse populations, comprising individuals from various nationalities, tend to develop more rapidly and become more inspiring. In my opinion, this is a contentious issue, but I firmly believe that nations that are tolerant and friendly towards others are better equipped to construct a more harmonious world, not only for themselves and their immediate surroundings, but also for future generations. This essay will delve into both perspectives on the attractiveness and development of countries based on national diversity.On one hand, individuals from different nationalities often struggle to understand one another, which can lead to impatience and create difficulties in communication, agreement-making, and problem-solving. For instance, people with diverse backgrounds may engage in heated debates about superior governmental constitutions, politics, religions, educational systems, traditional and alternative medicine, and so forth. It is essential to acknowledge that none of these individuals will be entirely right if they insist on showcasing their experiences rather than embracing others' ideas and offering constructive advice. Moreover, some disputes may even escalate into quarrels, rather than leading to informed decision-making, which can compromise the safety of individuals from diverse nationalities. Therefore, for peaceful coexistence and the exchange of developmental best practices, people must first and foremost respect one another, irrespective of their nationalities.On the other hand, individuals from diverse nationalities have the capacity to create not only intriguing and diverse communities but also to share knowledge and experience, thereby achieving optimal results in countries' development. To accomplish this, people should adhere to several fundamental, albeit unwritten, rules. Firstly, they should be tolerant of one another and accepting of differences. Secondly, they should be polite when sharing their knowledge and experiences, refraining from ostentation. Thirdly, it would be desirable if they could establish international communities where people can communicate, forge friendships, and exchange ideas. Last but not least, they should remember that their attitudes towards one another have a profound impact on the world at large, where they and their children reside, and thus, they should be accountable for their words and actions.In conclusion, countries that have successfully integrated people from diverse nationalities and fostered a friendly environment, in my opinion, are more likely to develop rapidly and resemble fascinating, diverse communities comprising individuals from varied backgrounds.
1374;Advertising affects what people think is important and has a negative effect on their lives (agree/disagree);Today people are surrounded by advertising. This affects what people think is important and has a negative impact on people’s lives. To what extent do you agree or disagree?With the advent of the Internet, advertisements, originally displayed only on TV, billboards, posters and so on, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and commonplace for the general public. In my view, this kind of impact could be both crucial and, on a certain level, detrimental.On the one hand, this phenomenon could denote that although we have already had a diverse range of , people are still capable of inventing innovative approaches catering for all kinds of requirements of advertising. It is a symbol that demonstrates the creativity rooted in human beings. Apart from that, it also represents that the speed of spreading information is conspicuously escalating. More purposeful is, therefore, the fact that, besides booming of the advertising, it constitutes a major reason why people could be so prosperous in this digital age.On the other hand, there are various unpleasant consequences as well. Firstly, with the omnipresent , it could potentially cause people to do impulsive shopping. Secondly, the , if regulated in a mismanaged , could make people constantly feel uncomfortable or annoyed. In this sense, instead of being an instrumental tool to promote amenities, advertisements could be considered a hindrance when people are frequently blocked by them. Furthermore, it would cost one precious time to have to sift the helpful ad from a host of others.In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, advertising is a beneficial phenomenon for all with a number of insignificant drawbacks. I believe that in the future we can improve the way advertising is done at present, and embrace the positive influence of advertising even further in the long run.This essay is another example of what Band 8 writing may look like. It’s weak point is that the author goes slightly off-topic while trying to discuss whether advertising affects what people view as important and instead talks about the reason advertising is spreading and about human creativity. However, the other part of task type (negative effects of advertising) is covered well, the ideas are well-developed and supported. There is a clear logical flow of information and a range of transitional words is used appropriately to sequence ideas. The way author uses synonyms to rephrase the task topic in the intro paragraph demonstrates their lexical skill, which is also evident in other parts of this essay. There are many complex sentences and very few errors. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.0.;The pervasive presence of advertising in modern life has sparked a debate about its impact on individuals' perceptions of importance and its overall effects on their lives. With the rise of the internet, advertisements are now ubiquitous, extending beyond traditional mediums like TV, billboards, and posters to become an integral part of daily life. In my opinion, this phenomenon has both significant benefits and drawbacks.On the one hand, the proliferation of advertising signifies the human capacity for innovation, catering to diverse advertising needs and showcasing creativity. It also underscores the accelerating pace of information dissemination, contributing to the prosperity of the digital age. The booming advertising industry is a key factor in this prosperity, making it a vital tool for promoting amenities and services.On the other hand, there are several negative consequences. Firstly, the omnipresence of advertising can lead to impulsive shopping, as individuals are constantly exposed to persuasive messages. Secondly, poorly regulated advertising can cause discomfort or annoyance, transforming what should be a useful promotional tool into a hindrance. Furthermore, the abundance of advertisements requires individuals to spend precious time distinguishing between useful and irrelevant ads.In conclusion, I believe that advertising is largely beneficial, despite some minor drawbacks. I am optimistic that future improvements in advertising practices will enhance its positive influence, allowing us to harness its benefits more effectively. This essay demonstrates characteristics of Band 8 writing in the IELTS. Although it slightly deviates from the topic by discussing the spread of advertising and human creativity, it effectively covers the negative aspects of advertising, with well-developed ideas and a clear logical flow. The use of transitional words, complex sentences, and lexical skills, such as rephrasing the task topic, are notable strengths. With few errors, this essay aligns with the standards of an IELTS Band 8.0 score.
1395;Advertising is all around us, it is an unavoidable part of everyone’s life. Some people say that advertising is a positive part of our lives while others say it is a negative one. Discuss both views and include your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. You should write at least 250 words.;Many people wonder about . Some people think that it has negative impact in our life. However, positive effect on this world.? Of Course for several reasons: firstly, it motivates the psychological point in everyone, and women in particular. They will run to buy this advertised product especially if it’s from , just to show their beauty to men, which may lead to negative effects of too much sexual attention. Secondly, you can sit comfortably with your family and suddenly the telephone is ringing, but it’s nothing important, it’s just another company to convince you to buy one of their products. It is a real . Lastly, sometimes you do not have the financial ability to buy something, but with these new methods of advertisement, you run to buy it, which affect your budget.On the other hand, there are some good sides to advertising. For instance, it compares the prices of many companies which the consumer. Besides, it really see more products which we unless the TV or Radio advertised them. , it breaks our daily routine and allows us to see new faces and learn the language better with the help of the daily updates they deliver through .In conclusion, as we can see there are many aspects to this . I feel that we gain no benefits at all from advertisement, it plays buy more things that they do not need it at all.;Many people ponder the impact of advertising on our lives. Some individuals believe it has a negative influence, but does it have a positive effect on the world? Of course, there are several reasons to consider. Firstly, advertising motivates people, particularly women, to purchase products that promote beauty and attractiveness to men, which can lead to excessive sexual attention and negative consequences. Secondly, advertising can be intrusive, interrupting daily life with constant phone calls and messages from companies trying to convince consumers to buy their products, creating a sense of annoyance. Lastly, advertising can encourage people to make impulsive purchases, even if they cannot afford them, ultimately affecting their budget.On the other hand, there are some benefits to advertising. For instance, it allows consumers to compare prices among different companies, making informed purchasing decisions. Additionally, advertising exposes consumers to a wide range of products they may not have known about otherwise, thanks to TV, radio, and other media. Advertising can also break up daily routines, introducing new faces and helping people learn languages more effectively through daily updates.In conclusion, as we can see, there are multiple aspects to consider when evaluating the effects of advertising. However, it seems that the drawbacks outweigh the benefits, as advertising often encourages people to buy things they do not need, promoting unnecessary consumerism.
845;Boxing is a blood sport which often results in physical injury. It is inappropriate for this sport to exist in the modern age.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;There is debatable issue as to whether boxing, a seemingly bloody sport, should be excluded from the modern society. As far as I am concerned, the attempt to remove boxing from the current age is utterly unjustified.Admittedly, boxing is often associated with various disturbing factors, such as foul language, disregard to rivals, violent punches and inelegant appearance as a result of intense physical contacts. However, such gory scenes may frequently take place in underground boxing games which are barely recognised by the professional community of boxing and by the legal system. Unlike underground boxing, professional boxing upholds moral principles and universal values, for examples, respect to opponents, obedience of rules, etc. Also, professional boxers are protected by safety equipment and judges who may stop the game when witnessing any player suffering serious injuries. Therefore, the health hazards involved in boxing games may not be as severe as the public assumes.Another reason reinforcing my position is that boxing already enjoys considerable popularity around the world and plays an important part in people's entertainment, as exemplified by the successful ticket sales of most boxing games and high audience rating of TV programmes broadcasting boxing matches. Given such popularity of boxing, the removal of this sport may cause widespread dissatisfaction and complaint.To draw a conclusion, the exclusion of boxing is completely groundless and irrational, given the safety protection, sportmanship and popularity as reflected in this sport. I expect in the future, more views could arise to furnish the understanding in this regard.;The question of whether boxing, a sport often perceived as brutal and bloody, has a place in modern society is a topic of debate. In my opinion, the attempt to banish boxing from contemporary life is entirely unwarranted.It is true that boxing is often linked to unpleasant aspects, such as profanity, disrespect towards opponents, violent blows, and unflattering appearances resulting from intense physical confrontations. Nevertheless, such gruesome scenes are more likely to occur in underground boxing matches, which are barely acknowledged by the professional boxing community and the legal system. In contrast, professional boxing adheres to moral principles and universal values, including respect for opponents, adherence to rules, and more. Moreover, professional boxers are safeguarded by protective gear and officials who can halt the match if a participant suffers severe injuries. Consequently, the health risks associated with boxing may be less severe than the public assumes.Another argument supporting my stance is that boxing has gained significant popularity worldwide, playing a vital role in entertaining people, as evident from the successful ticket sales of most boxing events and high television ratings for programs broadcasting boxing matches. Given boxing's popularity, its removal could lead to widespread discontent and protests.In conclusion, excluding boxing is completely unfounded and irrational, considering the safety measures, sportsmanship, and popularity that characterize this sport. I anticipate that in the future, more perspectives will emerge to deepen our understanding of this issue. 
1429;Boys are most influenced by their fathers and girls are most influenced by their mothers. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons to support your opinion.;It is true that nowadays have a great influence children. Some people hold the opinion that the same sex is the major determination of influencing parent, but others . As far as I am concerned, . My arguments for this point are listed below.First of all, a father is the person who have already passed ways his son is passing now, in other words, sons are following their father’s footsteps. , based on experience it is easy for a father to notice his sons’ drawbacks and to influence them.Secondly, it is true that a boy is , a girl is a subtle and fragile one. It is hard for mothers to influence their sons, because it is not likely that can affect a strong one.In conclusion, it seems to me unfair that boys are most influenced by their mothers. Based on at least two points above I strongly agree that children are influenced by a parent of the same gender.;It is undeniable that parents have a significant impact on their children's lives. While some people believe that the same sex plays a crucial role in determining parental influence, others disagree. In my opinion, children are more likely to be influenced by a parent of the same gender. My arguments for this point are as follows:Firstly, a father can serve as a role model for his son, as he has already navigated the path that his son is currently on. This shared experience enables a father to easily identify his son's weaknesses and provide guidance. Based on their similar life experiences, a father can have a profound influence on his son.Secondly, boys and girls have different personalities and characteristics. Boys are often more energetic and strong-willed, whereas girls are more subtle and fragile. As a result, mothers may find it challenging to influence their sons, as they may struggle to connect with and understand their sons' stronger and more assertive nature.In conclusion, it seems to me that boys are more likely to be influenced by their fathers, rather than their mothers. Based on the points mentioned above, I strongly believe that children are more influenced by a parent of the same gender. This is not to say that mothers have no influence on their sons, but rather that the influence of a same-gender parent can be more profound and lasting.
1364;Changing drivers age limits is the best way to reduce traffic accidents (from Target Band ;This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskThe best way to reduce traffic accidents is to raise the age limit for younger drivers and to lower the age limit for elderly ones. Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsIn today’s world the number of traffic accidents is constantly rising as well as the number of injuries and deaths they cause. A better regulative approach is required traffic accidents can be reduced. Some people say that changing the drivers’ age limits is the best solution to the problem. However, there are other, more practical ways to deal with this problem.One alternative is imposing heavier fines the drivers who exceed the permitted alcohol consumption. According to recent , a great proportion of traffic accidents has alcohol as its reason. Utilising technology and installing devices that detect drunk drivers and lock car ignition can be used to keep people with track record of drunk driving off the roads. On some occasions and for repeat offenders in particular, a prison sentence may also be considered.Furthermore, people should be better educated and more careful while behind the wheel. To be more specific, people should learn to obey road rules and respect the other drivers instead of causing tension or submitting to road rage. In addition, heavy fines should also be levied for exceeded speed limits. Last but not least, safer and wider roads should be constructed to make for easier and more comfortable driving.Tightening age limits for drivers can be a complementary approach. For example, the elderly with vision problems or other important health issues should be excluded from driving. Besides, young people under 18 years old are considered immature to drive. However, maturity does not necessarily always increases with one’s age, which is why other measures are needed dangerous driving.In conclusion, I believe that stronger measures should be implemented for the prevention of traffic accidents, and drivers should have a more responsible attitude. Setting age limits could be helpful but should not be considered the optimal and only solution to the problem.The writer’s position is clear throughout the essay. There is a logical organisation of information and effective use of paragraphing. The range of vocabulary is wide enough for the student to show flexibility and accuracy of expression. Overall, the control of grammar and punctuation is good, with only a few errors made. The essay is up to the mark and is likely to get Band 8 in IELTS.;"This essay is based on a topic from the ""Target Band 7"" book (page 54, reprinted with permission) and should take approximately 40 minutes to complete. The question is whether raising the age limit for young drivers and lowering it for elderly ones is the best way to reduce traffic accidents. In today's world, the rising number of traffic accidents, injuries, and fatalities necessitates a more effective regulatory approach. Some argue that adjusting the age limits for drivers is the solution, but there are more practical alternatives. One option is to impose stricter fines on drivers who exceed the permitted blood alcohol level, as a significant proportion of accidents are caused by drunk driving. Utilizing technology, such as devices that detect drunk drivers and prevent them from starting their cars, can keep repeat offenders off the roads. In severe cases, prison sentences may also be warranted.Moreover, drivers need to be better educated and more cautious on the road. This includes obeying traffic rules, respecting other drivers, and avoiding road rage. Heavy fines should also be imposed for speeding. Additionally, constructing safer and wider roads can facilitate easier and more comfortable driving. While adjusting age limits can be a supplementary measure, it is not a foolproof solution. For instance, elderly individuals with vision or health issues should not be allowed to drive, and those under 18 may be deemed too immature. However, maturity is not solely determined by age, and other measures are necessary to prevent reckless driving.In conclusion, I firmly believe that stricter measures are necessary to prevent traffic accidents, and drivers must adopt a more responsible attitude. Although setting age limits can be helpful, it should not be considered the only solution. The writer's stance is evident throughout the essay, and the information is logically organized with effective paragraphing. The vocabulary range is sufficient to demonstrate flexibility and accuracy of expression. Overall, the essay demonstrates good control of grammar and punctuation, with only minor errors. The essay meets the requirements and is likely to achieve a Band 8 score in IELTS."
1366;Childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents (agree/disagree);"Childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your own opinion and include relevant examples.It is true that parents need some knowledge and experience in order to raise their in an appropriate way. In this regard, many families attend different training courses. While I agree that these courses might be useful for some of them, I totally disagree with the recommended obligatory of such training.On the one hand, training courses usually offered by governments could be very useful for those guardians who have a with special needs. For example, if a child has a birth defect or has been diagnosed with any mental or musculoskeletal disorders, these kinds of training could be lifesaving. Additionally, as we know, the first few months after birth are really a crucial period of a child’s life; parents should obtain different information related to their child’s vaccinations, common health problems, different developmental issues and so on, which can be delivered through such training courses.On the other hand, I believe that making these programs a mandatory option would cause several problems for societies and individuals as well. To begin with, in order to achieve this goal, many professionals should be trained which may not be affordable for some governments. From an individual’s point of view, this kind of programs could be very time-consuming for some families who have other at home or who work long hours. The other important consideration is that parent training courses may not provide all the necessary information for each and every family. To be more specific, parents could get more beneficial information through different websites such as YouTube according to their own preferences.In conclusion, although I believe that many families can take advantage training courses, I do believe that making them a compulsory option for everyone is too time and money-consuming for individuals and governments.The introduction is very good and relevant. The writer’s position is balanced, relevantly and properly developed in two body paragraphs. The conclusion summarizes both sides of the argument and logically finished the essay. To maintain the necessary level of formality the word ‘kids’ should be replaced with ‘children’ everywhere in this essay. The use of prepositions needs more attention as some are inappropriate or incorrect. The length could be reduced – it’s not necessary to write a very long essay to get a higher score, and often it is better to write a shorter essay (no shorter than 250 words though!) but spend more time proofreading, correcting errors and improving the quality of writing. Overall this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.";The statement that childcare training courses should be mandatory for all parents is a topic of debate. In my opinion, while these courses can be beneficial, making them compulsory is not a viable solution. It is undeniable that parents require certain knowledge and skills to raise their children effectively, and many families attend various training courses to achieve this. However, I disagree with the notion of obligating these courses for all parents.On one hand, government-offered training courses can be extremely valuable for parents of children with special needs. For instance, if a child is born with a defect or is diagnosed with a mental or musculoskeletal disorder, such training can be crucial. Moreover, the initial months after birth are a critical period in a child's life, and parents need information on vaccinations, common health issues, developmental problems, and more, which these courses can provide. On the other hand, I believe that making these programs mandatory would lead to several issues for both societies and individuals. Firstly, training a sufficient number of professionals to lead these courses may be too costly for some governments. From an individual perspective, these programs can be very time-consuming, especially for families with multiple children or those who work long hours. Another significant consideration is that parent training courses may not cover all the necessary information for every family. Parents can often find more relevant and beneficial information on websites like YouTube, tailored to their specific needs and preferences.In conclusion, although I acknowledge the benefits of training courses for many families, I firmly believe that making them compulsory for everyone is too time-consuming and expensive for both individuals and governments. Therefore, while such courses have their advantages, they should not be made obligatory for all parents.
1384;Children should be engaged in paid work, agree or disagree?;"In many countries children are engaged in different kinds of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?The issue of whether or not children should be engaged in some paid work has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that having some employment experience is conducive to a child’s learning and development, I contend that it would bring harm to the child’s and learning.First of all, a workplace designed for adults normally child-friendly facilities. Desks and chairs are too high for a child; the light switches are installed on the walls unreachable children; also emergency training and facilities such as phones are only provided to adults. Furthermore, various hazards such as polluted air and chemical fumes are still produced in factories and farms. Undoubtedly young people would suffer in such workplaces.Also, children would find it frustrating when they are not properly inducted before starting a job. A child working in a cement factory would feel a setback when he could not get immediate support while struggling with the procedures of recording different raw materials that required by the job. Further, without sufficient support, a child’s misunderstanding or inappropriately communicating with adults would only disappoint him and prevents him from active learning and interacting with other people.To conclude, a child’s paid employment experience would lead to a negative impact on their health and active learning. However, recognizing the importance of children’s learning and their awareness of responsibility, it is advisable to encourage them to be involved in some volunteering opportunities where they can meaningfully learn and interact with other people with sufficient care and support in place for such jobs.This is a good essay. There are only a few errors (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections), but otherwise this work seems worthy of Band 7.5 or 8. Remember to always proofread your essay before submitting it. Keep up the good work!";The question of whether children should participate in paid work has sparked a heated debate worldwide. In many countries, children are engaged in various forms of paid employment, with some people viewing it as entirely inappropriate and others seeing it as a valuable learning experience that teaches responsibility. The debate surrounding the suitability of children engaging in paid work is contentious. While some people believe that having work experience is beneficial for a child's development and learning, I argue that it poses risks to the child's health and learning process.Firstly, workplaces designed for adults are not tailored to meet the needs of children. The physical environment, such as high desks and chairs, and light switches out of reach, is not child-friendly. Moreover, emergency facilities like phones are typically only accessible to adults. Additionally, many workplaces, such as factories and farms, still pose health hazards like polluted air and chemical fumes, which would undoubtedly affect young workers negatively.Furthermore, children may find the work environment frustrating due to inadequate induction and support. For instance, a child working in a cement factory might struggle with procedures like recording raw materials without immediate guidance, leading to disappointment and a barrier to active learning and interaction with others. Without sufficient support, misunderstandings or inappropriate communication with adults could hinder a child's ability to learn and engage with others meaningfully.In conclusion, paid employment for children would likely have a negative impact on their health and ability to learn actively. However, acknowledging the importance of children learning about responsibility, it is advisable to encourage their participation in volunteer work where they can learn and interact with others in a safe and supportive environment. This approach ensures that children gain valuable experience without being exposed to the potential harms of adult workplaces.

Obesity is a major problem which is increasing day by day in children. There are various reasons behind it. This essay will discuss the causes of obesity and offer some solutions.The first cause of obesity is junk food. It is often seen that mostly children are fond of burgers, pizzas, noodles and . These types of foods are easily available to them in school canteens. Children love to purchase chips, , ice-cream for lunch.

857;Competitiveness is a positive quality for people in most societies. How does competitiveness affect individuals? Is it a positive or negative trend?;Life is full of competition. Soon after the release from competitive university exams, the hard fighting for higher positions in a company will be waiting for you. While the competitiveness has been bringing us a convenient society, no small number of employments have been tired of never-ending competitions. No doubt about a positive effect on societies, but when we start to argue about the effect on individuals, it becomes more controversial. This essay will argue the drawbacks of competitiveness for individuals, especially from the perspective of Japanese modern society and typical Japanese office workers. I believe that cooperativeness and uniqueness are sometimes more important attitude than competitiveness.Firstly, competitiveness causes less diversity. If there is a competition, there must be the same evaluation metrics to differentiate winners and losers. The evaluation procedure needs to limit the metrics into specific aspects of the human being. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to prove that the metrics are proper for all of the possible cases and effective for the HR evaluation. For example, Japanese companies are likely to judge quantitatively based on the numbers related to performance. However, how can we evaluate the cooperativity or the non-quantitative performance like in creative jobs? Most Japanese companies adopted the HR evaluation methods based on average working hours per day and number of reports monthly. That’s why the Japanese tend to overwork to fulfill this requirement. In addition, as a result of placing more importance in quantity of reports, rather than quality, Japanese employees are prone to choose easy and short-term tasks or outsourcing instead of building by their own methods. This tendency causes fewer complicated and long-term tasks.Secondly, competitiveness causes less cooperativeness. Fewer people volunteer to play a disadvantageous role for smooth teamwork. Moreover, some people play an evil role by blaming or cheating the competitors in order to be superior to them. As a consequence, overall efficiency will decline and some people will be overestimated. Even if there are no problems temporarily, the long-lasting large companies will eventually become corrupt, and those who have the most political power, rather than real power, will remain at the top.Consequently, competitiveness is the basis of capitalism which brings us a brighter and more convenient society, however, biased evaluation and less cooperative working environment possibly drive people into nervous breakdowns. Karoshi, overwork death derived from too much stress and less sleeping, is one of the most serious social problems in Japan. We may need to rethink about the competitiveness.;"Life is inherently competitive, with the intense competition of university exams soon giving way to the fierce battle for advancement in the corporate world. While competitiveness has undoubtedly contributed to the development of a convenient and prosperous society, its relentless nature has also taken a toll on numerous individuals, leaving them exhausted and disillusioned. The impact of competitiveness on society is undeniable, but its effects on individuals are more nuanced and contentious. This essay will examine the drawbacks of competitiveness for individuals, with a particular focus on modern Japanese society and the typical office worker.I firmly believe that cooperativeness and uniqueness are essential attitudes that are often overshadowed by the emphasis on competitiveness. Firstly, competitiveness can lead to a lack of diversity, as it necessitates a standardized evaluation metric to distinguish between winners and losers. This metric is often limited to specific aspects of human performance, making it challenging to prove its efficacy and fairness in all cases. For instance, Japanese companies frequently rely on quantitative evaluations based on performance metrics, such as working hours and report numbers. However, this approach struggles to account for intangible aspects like cooperativeness or creative performance. The adoption of such HR evaluation methods has led to a culture of overwork in Japan, where employees prioritize fulfilling quantitative requirements over quality and complexity. This, in turn, results in a dearth of complex and long-term tasks.Secondly, competitiveness can erode cooperativeness, as individuals become less inclined to take on supportive roles that may not yield immediate benefits. Furthermore, some individuals may engage in unscrupulous behavior, such as blaming or cheating others, to gain a competitive edge. This not only undermines overall efficiency but also leads to inaccurate assessments of performance, where those with the most political influence, rather than actual ability, rise to the top. Even if this approach appears to yield short-term gains, it can ultimately lead to corruption and stagnation in large, established companies.In conclusion, while competitiveness is a fundamental aspect of capitalism, which has undoubtedly brought about significant advancements and improvements in our society, its negative consequences, such as biased evaluations and a lack of cooperativeness, can have devastating effects on individuals. The alarming rise of ""karoshi"" (overwork death) in Japan, which is attributed to excessive stress and sleep deprivation, is a stark reminder of the need to reassess our emphasis on competitiveness. It is essential to strike a balance between the drive for excellence and the importance of cooperativeness, uniqueness, and individual well-being. By recognizing the value of these often-overlooked attitudes, we can work towards"
425;Computers are now the basis of the modern world. They should therefore be introduced into classrooms, and their programs used for direct teaching purposes. However, dependence on computers in teaching may carry a certain degree of risk to students.Discuss both sides and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Computers are presntly an integral part of the civilized world and are essential to daily living. Some individuals believe that they should be introduced into the classroom and used for teaching purposes while others are of the opinion that dependence on computers in teaching may pose a risk to students.Introducing computers and their programs in educational instuitions for learning purposes is a beneficial thing to students. The world is fast changing and students need to meet up and be at par with others in the world. The globe is becoming a more digital place and computers are the core of that, teaching using computers will open students' minds to new possibilitiies, faster approaches and more advanced ways of solving problems. A recent study showed that 75% of students who were taught using computers are currently more successful than others in their work places.It is understandable that people also think that dependence on computers in teaching may be detrimental to students. The students may become lazy and may not necessarily want to use their brains to calculate or understand things because the computer has already done that for them. Also using computers to learn in the school environment is also just adding to screen time for the learners; they are already being exposed to lots of wrong things at home adding school to it may not neceesarily the best option.Personally, students have a lot to learn using computers but truthfully speaking most of them already have the technological know how when it comes to using computers and if they actually want to learn more about how to use them, they can do so at home using the popular learning sites, it doesnt necessarily have to be introduced into the school learning system.In conclusion,computers are currently the foundation of the modern world and have their advantages and disadvantages, if they are put to the right use at the appropriate place and time, its benefits are beyond measure.";Computers have become an essential part of modern life, playing a vital role in daily activities. While some people argue that introducing computers into the classroom can enhance teaching and learning, others believe that over-reliance on computers may have negative consequences for students.However, incorporating computers and their programs into educational institutions can have numerous benefits for students. The world is rapidly evolving, and students need to keep pace with their peers globally. As the world becomes increasingly digital, computers are at the forefront of this shift. Utilizing computers in teaching can broaden students' perspectives, introduce them to innovative problem-solving methods, and facilitate faster access to information. Research has shown that 75% of students who received computer-based education are more successful in their professional lives compared to their counterparts.On the other hand, it is understandable that some individuals are concerned about the potential drawbacks of relying heavily on computers in education. Excessive computer use may lead to laziness, as students may rely too heavily on technology to perform calculations and understand concepts, rather than developing their critical thinking skills. Furthermore, adding computer-based learning to the school environment may contribute to increased screen time, which can be detrimental when combined with the existing screen time students are exposed to at home.From a personal perspective, while students can undoubtedly gain valuable knowledge from using computers, many already possess the necessary technological skills to navigate and learn from computers. If students are interested in acquiring more advanced computer skills, they can do so through online learning platforms in the comfort of their own homes. Therefore, it may not be necessary to integrate computers into the school curriculum.In conclusion, computers are a fundamental part of modern society, offering both advantages and disadvantages. When used appropriately and in the right context, the benefits of computers can be substantial. It is crucial to strike a balance between harnessing the potential of computers in education and minimizing their negative consequences, ultimately ensuring that students can effectively navigate and thrive in an increasingly digital world.
1329;Crime rates are likely to decline due to the advancements in technology, which will help prevent and solve crimes in an easier way. Do you agree or disagree?;"Nowadays technology is advancing faster than ever and many fields are benefitting from the opportunities this trend presents. Some think that crime prevention can be one possible application of new technologies, by allowing to deter offenders or solve crimes in a faster and easier way. In my opinion, innovation in crime prevention can be a game-changer that will reduce both the number of crimes committed and the time it takes to catch those responsible for them.Not everyone is optimistic about the prospects of the use of new technologies in crime prevention, and those who subscribe to the more pessimistic view say that advanced technologies can be accessed by criminals, therefore raising the crime rates. Such tools can, indeed, cause more damage if they fall in the wrong hands; however, it would require the offenders to be highly skilled to be able to use the modern technologies. Statistically, many of them tend to have a lower level of education, and for that reason they are likely to stick to the old ways of committing crimes, whereas the minority of highly skilled criminals are unlikely to make a big difference to the crime levels.Law enforcement workforce, on the other hand, has a much better grip on modern technology. Nowadays police officers and detectives undergo special training, take regular skill update courses, and use high-tech equipment. Facial recognition and thermal imaging are just two examples of the important tools that police are already using to find and catch offenders faster. Ordinary citizens can do their part in preventing burglaries by installing sophisticated systems with sensors, CCTV video feed and various alarms to detect and deter thieves. The combined effort will, no doubt, push the crime curve down.To sum up, even though the wonders of technology are available to everyone, it seems to me that they will better assist law enforcement in solving crimes, and law-abiding citizens in protecting themselves and their property, rather than felons. This will tip the balance in favour of reduction in crime rate and make the world a safer place.";The rapid advancement of technology is transforming numerous fields, and many believe that crime prevention can greatly benefit from these innovations. By utilizing new technologies, it may be possible to deter offenders and solve crimes more efficiently. In my view, innovative approaches to crime prevention have the potential to be a game-changer, significantly reducing the number of crimes committed and the time it takes to apprehend those responsible.However, not everyone shares this optimism, and some argue that advanced technologies can be exploited by criminals, potentially increasing crime rates. While it is true that these tools can cause harm if they fall into the wrong hands, it is essential to consider that using modern technologies effectively requires a high level of skill. Statistically, many offenders tend to have lower levels of education, making them more likely to rely on traditional methods of committing crimes. The minority of highly skilled criminals are unlikely to have a substantial impact on overall crime levels.On the other hand, law enforcement agencies have a strong grasp of modern technology. Police officers and detectives undergo specialized training, participate in regular skill update courses, and utilize high-tech equipment. Tools such as facial recognition and thermal imaging are already being employed to quickly locate and apprehend offenders. Additionally, ordinary citizens can contribute to preventing burglaries by installing sophisticated security systems equipped with sensors, CCTV video feeds, and alarms to detect and deter thieves. The combined efforts of law enforcement and citizens will undoubtedly contribute to a decline in crime rates.In conclusion, although technological advancements are accessible to everyone, it appears that they will primarily assist law enforcement in solving crimes and law-abiding citizens in protecting themselves and their property, rather than aiding felons. This will shift the balance in favor of reducing crime rates, ultimately making the world a safer place.

1409;Dieting can change a person’s life for the better or ruins one’s health completely. What’s your opinion?;Dieting seems to be of our life in this modern society, especially for those who are health conscious. Different people choose different type of dieting methods, trying to achieve what they believe to be good for either their health or physical appearance. In general, most of the people who diet are focusing on controlling their weight.In our urban society, most of the working class not have the opportunity to consume . Their daily meals consist of fast food which contains large amounts of fat and salt. The most significant of this unhealthy lifestyle is the weight gain especially among those middle age working professionals.Therefore, most of these young and energetic people have to control their diet in order to stay in shape either for their appearance or health. The most common and proper method of maintaining one’s weight is eating less oily food, preferably more green vegetables, fruits and alcohol.However, some have resorted to losing weight by taking their diet to the extreme, not eating at all for days. Others will make themselves vomit after each meal. Many others will go for dieting medication and beverages that help them to lose their appetite. These unhealthy will cause internal damage in the long run.In my opinion, dieting for better health is more important than solely for looking attractive. Individuals who wish to control their weight should seek professional if they are unable to reduce their weight after switching over to a healthy diet for a period of time. Losing weight and losing your health at the same time does not benefit any individual.This essay needs some work. The first body paragraph explains the reason people have for dieting, whereas it should explain what are the advantages or the dangers of it. The second body paragraph explains how to diet, whereas it should present arguments for or against dieting. Therefore, the task is only partially covered here.;In today's modern society, dieting has become an integral part of life, particularly for those who prioritize their health. Individuals adopt various dieting methods, aiming to achieve their desired physical appearance or improve their well-being. While controlling weight is a primary concern for most dieters, the importance of dieting extends beyond mere physical appearance. On one hand, dieting can have numerous benefits, such as reducing the risk of chronic diseases, like diabetes and heart conditions, which are prevalent in urban societies where fast food and sedentary lifestyles dominate. A well-planned diet can also enhance mental health and boost energy levels. However, the dangers of dieting should not be overlooked. Extreme dieting methods, including starvation, self-induced vomiting, and relying on diet medications or beverages, can lead to severe internal damage and other health complications in the long run.On the other hand, some argue that dieting is essential for maintaining a healthy weight, especially for middle-aged working professionals who are prone to weight gain due to their unhealthy lifestyle. A balanced diet that includes plenty of green vegetables, fruits, and moderate amounts of lean proteins can help individuals achieve their desired weight and improve their overall health. Nevertheless, it is crucial to prioritize health over physical appearance when it comes to dieting. Seeking professional advice is essential for those who struggle to reduce their weight after adopting a healthy diet. Losing weight should not come at the expense of one's health, as this can have devastating consequences. Ultimately, a balanced and informed approach to dieting is vital to reap its benefits while minimizing its risks. 
1323;Discipline is a growing problem in modern schools. Some people think that parents should discipline their own children, while others think it should be the responsibility of the government. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;While some people argue that parents should take sole responsibility for disciplining their children, others take the view that the government should be in charge of such matters. In my opinion, the young generation should be primarily guided by their parents where rules of behavior and moral principles are concerned. However, in some instances government intervention is necessary.On one side of the argument, there are people who hold the opinion that the responsibility of disciplining a child falls squarely on parents’ shoulders, since they are their first educators, and it is their duty to equip their children with good manners and morals even before their first day at school. In addition, every family has a unique understanding of what a suitable form of discipline entails. Therefore, some parents are concerned that any form of punishment meted out at school might be too harsh. To overcome this issue, they believe that parents should be informed by the school of their child’s wrongdoing so that they could decide an appropriate consequence for their behavior at home.Unfortunately, not all parents are objective enough to make the right decisions when it comes to the upbringing of their children. Some may lack information or sound moral background to discipline their children in a meaningful way. Therefore, the state should shoulder some of the responsibility by implementing a strict set of guidelines and policies on how to discipline children at school. I believe that such policies result in children who flourish and are more likely to become productive citizens that actively contribute to a prosperous nation. Also, this would help both parents and teachers understand which punishments are suitable for minor infractions like missing an assignment or major incidents like bullying or skipping school.In conclusion, while both views are commonly held in society, I believe that the government must be actively involved in the policies related to discipline at schools as this would ensure the well-being and successful development of the youth.;The debate about who should be responsible for disciplining children, parents or the government, is a contentious issue. Some argue that parents should be solely in charge of teaching their children right from wrong, while others believe that the government should play a role in this aspect of child development. In my opinion, parents should be the primary source of guidance for children when it comes to behavioral rules and moral principles, but government intervention is sometimes necessary.On the one hand, many people believe that parents are responsible for disciplining their children, as they are their first teachers and have a unique understanding of what discipline means to their family. They should be informed by schools about their child's misbehavior, allowing them to decide on an appropriate punishment at home. This approach acknowledges that every family has different values and beliefs about discipline.However, not all parents are equipped to make informed decisions about their children's upbringing. Some may lack the necessary knowledge, moral background, or objectivity to discipline their children effectively. In such cases, the state should step in by establishing clear guidelines and policies for disciplining children in schools. I believe that these policies can lead to well-adjusted, productive citizens who contribute positively to society. They also provide clarity for both parents and teachers on suitable punishments for various infractions, ranging from minor issues like missed assignments to serious incidents like bullying or truancy.In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I think that government involvement in school discipline policies is essential for the well-being and successful development of young people. By finding a balance between parental responsibility and government guidance, we can ensure that children receive the support and direction they need to thrive.
1066;Eating sweet foods produces acid in the mouth, which can cause tooth decay. (High acid levels are measured by low pH values)Describe the information below and discuss the implications for dental health.;The given graph shows the level of acidity in the mouth from consuming food that contains fruit or cane sugar and honey.To start with, if we take a look at honey-consistent food, we will notice that the acid level increases within the first 5 minutes. After that, the level of acidity remains at the rate of less than 5 pH, and, then goes down to a normal level. So, it is unlikely tooth decay to occur within such a short period of time.Regarding fruit and cane sugar-consistent food, it is quite noticeable that the acidity level increases dramatically at a level of less than 5.5 pH and 4.5 pH, respectively. However, the main difference between fruit and cane sugar is that the acid level of fruit sugar decreases within a bit more than 15 minutes. In contrast to it, the acid level of cane sugar goes down to a normal level within more than 25 minutes, which is more likely to get tooth decay.;The graph illustrates the acidity levels in the mouth after consuming foods containing fruit, cane sugar, or honey. Initially, examining foods with honey content reveals a notable increase in acidity within the first 5 minutes. Following this, the acidity level stabilizes below a pH of 5 and then gradually returns to normal. This rapid return to normal levels suggests that tooth decay is unlikely to occur within such a short timeframe.In contrast, foods containing fruit or cane sugar exhibit a dramatic increase in acidity, with levels dropping below 5.5 pH and 4.5 pH, respectively. A key distinction between the two is observed in the duration of acidity: the acidity from fruit decreases to normal levels in just over 15 minutes. Conversely, the acidity from cane sugar takes more than 25 minutes to return to normal, making it more likely to contribute to tooth decay due to the prolonged exposure to acidic conditions.
1362;Education in financial management should be a mandatory component of the school program, agree/disagree (from Target Band ;This essay was written on a topic from “Target Band 7” book (page 54, reprinted with permission).You should spend about 40 minutes on this taskEducation in financial management should be a mandatory component of the school program. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsMore and more young adults in our country are heavily indebted. Thus, it is considered by some that it should be mandatory to educate school children the administration of money. In my opinion, people should not leave school without a sound knowledge of financial management.To begin with, a country’s development is strongly upon the purchasing capacity of its inhabitants. That is to say, people who are in debt or financially vulnerable, would not be able to spend freely or invest, for example, in a new house, thus hindering the economic growth of the country. As a consequence, the rate of inflation would rise and people would be able to afford even less, which could ultimately result in the collapse of the entire economy. A good example of this vicious circle can be seen in countries such as Argentina, where people have to buy household items in the black market, because they cannot afford to buy them in regular stores due to skyrocketing prices. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to teach children early money management.Another point to consider is the low standard of living that people have when they mismanage their finances. Individuals who are constantly short of money could eventually end up being socially isolated and unhappy, because they couldn’t afford to participate in leisure activities, such as going to the cinema with a friend, resulting in their from social life. However, this could be avoided with ease by offering courses in money management.In conclusion, I strongly believe that school children should be taught how to manage their finances to prevent social isolation later in their life as well as to maintain the economic force of their country.The writer’s position is clear throughout the essay. Paragraphing is used effectively to organise ideas and information, however the paragraphs could have been balanced better in terms of the amount of content. The advanced vocabulary the writer uses creates a good impression of mature and fluent writer. Overall, the control of grammar and punctuation is fine, and the number of errors is small. The essay could achieve Band 8 in IELTS.;"The essay under discussion was extracted from the ""Target Band 7"" book, page 54, with permission. It is recommended to spend approximately 40 minutes on this task.The notion that education in financial management should be a compulsory part of school curricula has sparked debate. To what extent do you concur or dissent from this statement? Provide rationales for your stance and incorporate examples from your personal experience. A minimum of 250 words is required.A significant number of young adults in our nation are burdened with substantial debt, prompting some to advocate for the inclusion of financial literacy in school programs. In my viewpoint, individuals should not graduate without a solid grasp of financial management principles.Initially, a nation's economic growth is heavily contingent upon the purchasing power of its populace. In other words, individuals encumbered by debt or financially insecure would be unable to spend freely or invest, for instance, in real estate, thereby hindering the nation's economic expansion. Consequently, inflation rates would escalate, and people would be able to afford even less, potentially culminating in the collapse of the entire economy. A paradigm of this vicious cycle can be observed in countries such as Argentina, where individuals are compelled to purchase household essentials on the black market due to exorbitant prices in regular stores. Hence, it is imperative to educate children about money management from an early age.Another aspect to ponder is the low standard of living that individuals experience when they mismanage their finances. Those constantly struggling financially may ultimately become socially isolated and unhappy, as they are unable to participate in leisure activities, such as attending the cinema with a friend, resulting in a diminished social life. However, this could be effortlessly avoided by offering courses in money management.In conclusion, I firmly believe that school children should be instructed on financial management to prevent social isolation later in life and maintain their country's economic stability.The writer's stance is evident throughout the essay, and paragraphing is effectively utilized to organize ideas and information. Nevertheless, the paragraphs could have been more balanced in terms of content. The advanced vocabulary employed by the writer creates a favorable impression of a mature and fluent writer. Overall, the command of grammar and punctuation is satisfactory, with a minimal number of errors. This essay has the potential to achieve a Band 8 score in IELTS."

The impact of globalization on the world economy is multifaceted. It's essential to recognize that the negative effects are distinct from the positive ones. The negative aspects, such as low wages in less developed countries, are significant and warrant attention.For instance, taking the Eurozone as an example, the economic changes brought about by globalization are substantial. Many companies have relocated their factories to countries with cheaper production costs, resulting in rising unemployment rates in traditional industrial nations. However, for other countries like China, this shift in jobs presents a significant opportunity.It's crucial to acknowledge that the consequences for less developed countries, whose economies rely heavily on the availability of cheap labor, are substantial. Based on these facts, globalization can create problems. Nevertheless, there are also positive aspects to consider. Notably, a new trend of ""Thinking Global"" has emerged, where people are more willing to learn languages and educate themselves about different cultures. Countries like India, which were previously underdeveloped, are now getting opportunities to excel in specific fields.In conclusion, the effects of globalization are profound. The nature of economic processes has undergone a complete transformation. It's vital to think in broader terms, beyond national borders. While the positive outcomes of globalization are significant, it's essential to balance them with the negative consequences. Ideally, the world should strive for equilibrium, but this goal remains to be achieved."
1319;Even though experts believe that walking is a great way to improve one’s health, very few people walk nowadays. Why aren’t people walking? What can be done to encourage them to walk more?;The benefits of walking are numerous, and experts recommend it as a good way to keep healthy and fit. Despite this, the number of people who walk on a daily basis is on the decline. The reasons for this are manifold, but there are also several solutions that may help people walk more.Lack of time is the most common reason people cite for not engaging in any form of physical activity. These days most people have hectic schedules that involve juggling their work and home responsibilities. As a result, they are often too exhausted or pressed for time and therefore opt for faster and more comfortable forms of transport, such as cars, bikes or public transport. Another major reason for the reduced number of pedestrians on the roads is a lack of safety. Most full-time workers are not free to walk during the day, and will skip it in the evenings or early morning hours, if they do not feel safe enough to do so.Fortunately, there are quite a few solutions to this issue. One is making walkers safe, which means the government should ensure that there are enough sidewalks and streetlights available in every suburb, so that pedestrians can walk or jog safely whenever time allows. Another useful option is to create special walking tracks and parks in neighbourhoods where people can get some much-needed exercise in the evenings. The added benefit of promoting the healthy lifestyle and walking in the community makes this solution even more attractive.To conclude, the pressures of daily life and lack of safely while walking reduce the popularity of this healthy practice. Governments can reverse this trend by creating more green spaces for people to walk in and addressing their safety concerns.;Walking is an excellent way to maintain physical health and fitness, and experts highly recommend it. However, the number of people incorporating walking into their daily routine is decreasing. There are several reasons for this decline, but fortunately, there are also potential solutions to encourage more people to walk. The primary reason people give for not engaging in physical activity, including walking, is a lack of time. With increasingly busy schedules that balance work and home responsibilities, many individuals are left exhausted and short on time, opting instead for quicker modes of transportation like driving, cycling, or using public transport. Safety concerns also play a significant role in the reduced number of pedestrians. Many full-time workers are restricted to walking during limited hours, and if they feel unsafe, they tend to avoid walking altogether, especially in the early morning or evening.Fortunately, several solutions can address this issue. Ensuring walker safety is crucial, which involves the government providing adequate sidewalks and street lighting in all suburbs, allowing pedestrians to walk safely at any time. Creating dedicated walking paths and parks in neighborhoods is another viable option, providing residents with safe spaces to exercise in the evenings. This solution is particularly appealing as it promotes a healthy lifestyle and encourages walking within the community.In conclusion, the demands of daily life and safety concerns while walking are significant deterrents to this healthy habit. Nevertheless, governments can help reverse this trend by developing more green spaces for walking and addressing safety concerns. By doing so, they can make walking a more appealing and accessible option for everyone, ultimately promoting healthier lifestyles and communities.
1410;Even though globalization affects the world’s economy in a very positive way, its negative side should not be forgotten. Discuss.;Everything has two sides and the globalization is not exception. Our first thoughts about this topic include the process of global “McDonaldisation” and, generally speaking, spreading across the whole Globe.Firstly, I would try to concentrate on the positive aspects of globalisation. As far as economy is concerned, like the Global Bank or IMF are always focused on developing the ‘Third World’ and helping poor people to combat their life obstacles (through loans and donations). Moreover, the world becomes an area of sharing thoughts (e.g. philosophical or economical doctrines), which become popular due to lack of barriers.However, disadvantages of globalization are also widely known. Some people insist that because of this process, the spirit of countries and nations rapidly disappears. The integrity, established years ago is on the verge of collapsing. Furthermore, there’s a strong lobby of communists who , that the globalization indicates an uncontrolled reign of capitalists and slave work of lower labour-class. We should never forget about the detrimental impact of global investments on the environment – the green house effect or soar rains are triggered by globalization.To sum up, globalization has both positive and negative influence on our everyday life. I can’t agree with the popular statement that we should try to avoid being affected by it. However, we must not forget about our surroundings and local communities. They have a great value which should last forever.;"Like any phenomenon, globalization has its dual nature. Initially, our thoughts on this topic often revolve around the concept of a global ""McDonaldisation"" and the spread of uniformity across the globe. In exploring this concept, it's beneficial to first examine the positive aspects of globalization. From an economic standpoint, institutions such as the Global Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are dedicated to the development of underprivileged countries, offering assistance to impoverished communities through loans and donations. Moreover, globalization facilitates the exchange of ideas and doctrines, whether philosophical or economic, on a global scale, unhindered by geographical barriers.However, the drawbacks of globalization are equally pronounced. Critics argue that this process leads to the erosion of national and cultural identities, threatening the integrity that has been established over centuries. Furthermore, there is a strong argument from communists that globalization symbolizes the unchecked dominance of capitalism and the exploitation of the working class. It's also crucial to acknowledge the detrimental environmental impacts of global investments, such as the greenhouse effect and acid rains, which are exacerbated by globalization.In conclusion, globalization exerts both positive and negative influences on our daily lives. While I disagree with the notion that we should attempt to isolate ourselves from these effects, it's imperative that we remain mindful of our immediate surroundings and local communities. These hold significant value that should be preserved indefinitely. By recognizing both sides of globalization, we can work towards maximizing its benefits while mitigating its negative consequences, ultimately fostering a more balanced and equitable global community."
1306;Every household should have a government-imposed limit on the amount of rubbish it can throw away. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"The amount of waste people produce can be quite shocking, with every person generating kilograms of rubbish in a single day, and all this can be difficult to manage. This has given some people the idea that there should be a limitation on the amount of rubbish produced per household; however, opinions are divided as to whether this would be the the most effective option.Having a limitation on the amount of waste produced sounds like a fine solution to a significant problem, with over two hundred and fifty million tons being generated in 2016 by the U.S. alone. Taxing households that break limits would push people to produce less waste and make them more mindful of what can be recycled or composted. However, forcing people to produce less waste might not be attainable.Households produce as much waste as they need to live their lifestyles. The waste people generate is only a result of the products they purchase, and will most likely wish to continue to purchase. Taxing people may be a cause of resentment, with many of them already struggling to pay their usual bills. In addition, if people produce more than they are allowed, this will encourage littering and dumping, so that they are not caught with more waste than entitled, and this in turn will damage the environment.Though controlling the amount of waste produced is important, there could be other ways of encouraging lesser output. In my opinion, governments should encourage composting and recycling, which will also reduce wasted material. People should also be more aware of what waste they produce and how it can be reduced. An education drive on these issues would perhaps be more likely to succeed in reducing rubbish than imposing limitations.";The sheer volume of waste generated by individuals can be staggering, with each person producing several kilograms of trash daily, making waste management a daunting task. This has led some to propose implementing waste production limits per household, but opinions are split on whether this is the most effective solution. On the surface, capping waste production appears to be a viable solution to a significant problem, considering the United States alone generated over 250 million tons of waste in 2016. Imposing taxes on households that exceed these limits could incentivize people to reduce their waste output and become more mindful of recycling and composting opportunities. However, forcing individuals to cut down on waste might not be a feasible or realistic goal.Households generate waste as a byproduct of their lifestyle and consumption habits. The waste people produce is a direct result of their purchasing decisions, and they are likely to continue buying the products they need or want. Taxing people for exceeding waste limits may foster resentment, particularly among those already struggling to pay their bills. Furthermore, strict waste limits could lead to unintended consequences, such as littering and illegal dumping, as people may attempt to avoid penalties for exceeding their allotted waste quota, ultimately causing more harm to the environment.While controlling waste production is crucial, there may be alternative approaches to encouraging reduced waste output. In my view, governments should focus on promoting composting and recycling, which would also decrease the amount of wasted materials. Raising awareness about the waste people generate and ways to minimize it could also be effective. An educational campaign addressing these issues might be more successful in reducing waste than imposing restrictions.
1406;Every year an increasing number of students choose to go to another country for their higher education. Do you think the benefits of this development outweigh the problems associated with it?;The past twenty years have seen a dramatic change the number of students who go abroad . In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of this trend.On the one hand, both students and their country can benefit from this trend. First, students can choose more suitable methods for themselves because there are more options. The and teaching methods are quite different . According to foreign experts, Secondly, people can improve their foreign language, they can contact with when they are in a foreign country, and they quickly master the foreign language. Thirdly, it helps to promote the mutual understanding between their mother land and their destination countries. These students exchange information with the locals. Students can get better understanding of the countries. People in their home country will get more vivid information about other countries . Similarly, the locals also can get more clear recognition about other countries.On the other hand, there are disadvantages too. Firstly, it costs people a lot of money to begin college in foreign countries. Many families have to take out all their savings to support their children abroad. Secondly, some students cannot stand the big difference the new environment, they quit their study and come back home.To conclude, given the fact that in foreign countries helps students with their studies and promotes the mutual understanding countries, even if there are some drawbacks, I think the benefits outweigh the problems.;Over the past twenty years, there has been a significant shift in the number of students pursuing higher education abroad. This essay will examine the advantages and disadvantages of this trend. On the one hand, both students and their home country can benefit from studying abroad. Firstly, students have access to a broader range of academic options, allowing them to choose the most suitable methods for their individual needs. The teaching methods and approaches used in foreign institutions are often distinct and can provide a unique learning experience. Additionally, studying abroad offers students the opportunity to improve their foreign language skills through immersion and interaction with locals, enabling them to quickly become proficient. Furthermore, this trend helps promote mutual understanding between the students' home country and their host countries. Through exchanging information with locals, students can gain a deeper understanding of the host country, while also sharing knowledge about their own country with others. This, in turn, can provide people back home with more vivid and accurate information about other countries, and vice versa.On the other hand, there are also drawbacks to consider. Firstly, pursuing higher education in a foreign country can be extremely costly, with many families having to deplete their savings to support their children's studies abroad. Secondly, some students may struggle to adapt to the significant differences in their new environment, leading them to abandon their studies and return home.In conclusion, despite some drawbacks, I believe that the benefits of studying abroad outweigh the problems. The experience not only enhances students' academic pursuits but also fosters greater mutual understanding between nations. Ultimately, the advantages of studying abroad make it a worthwhile endeavor, even considering the challenges that may arise.
1305;Everybody today should pay a small amount from their income in order to help people who are homeless and / or suffering great poverty. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Homelessness and poverty is a terrible but topical issue in both more economically advanced and less industrialised countries. To deal with this, many people feel that a small proportion of everyone’s income should be used to aid the homeless and poor. This could create more opportunities and change the lives of many disadvantaged people for the better.Though there are certain facilities such as shelters and soup kitchens to aid the poor and homeless, it is clear that this is not enough. In the U.S. alone, a very developed country in itself, nearly two million people are homeless. These facilities can lend a helpful hand; however, they do not help eradicate the problem. Those people who are homeless or poor can have trouble finding jobs, or, if they are lucky to gain employment, the pay may not be enough to support them and their families.If a small percentage of everyone’s income was used to help build more aid facilities and fund organisations to help the homeless and poor, the suffering of many people could be alleviated. However, this is not a perfect world, and taxes are high enough for many people. A similar argument could be that a portion of the taxes already paid to the government should then be set aside for this cause, but of course government funds are usually stretched to breaking point as it is, as governments have so many financial responsibilities already.Though the fundamental idea that people should pay a small percentage of their income to help the homeless and poor is admirable, it is unlikely that enough people would agree to it. People need all the money they earn after taxes anyway and, although governments already have too many calls on their available funds, in my view they should prioritise support payments for the homeless.";The issue of homelessness and poverty is a pressing concern that affects both developed and less industrialized countries. Many believe that allocating a small portion of individual incomes to support the homeless and poor could create opportunities and improve the lives of disadvantaged individuals. Although facilities like shelters and soup kitchens provide some assistance, they are insufficient to address the problem. In the United States, a highly developed country, nearly two million people are homeless, highlighting the inadequacy of current support systems. These facilities offer temporary relief, but do not eradicate the root causes of homelessness and poverty, which can be exacerbated by difficulties in finding employment or securing a living wage.To effectively alleviate the suffering of many, a small percentage of individual incomes could be utilized to establish more aid facilities and fund organizations that support the homeless and poor. However, this proposal is not without its challenges, as many people already feel that taxes are too high. An alternative solution could be to allocate a portion of existing taxes towards this cause, but government funds are often over-extended due to numerous financial responsibilities.While the concept of contributing a small percentage of one's income to support the homeless and poor is commendable, its implementation is unlikely due to potential resistance from individuals who rely on their full income after taxes. Nevertheless, in my opinion, governments should prioritize supporting the homeless and poor, despite their already strained finances, as a moral imperative to address this pressing social issue.
1407;Financial education should be a mandatory component of the school program. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;In many countries the discussion about financial education getting more serious due to financial problems of young generation. Some people that financial education should be considered a mandatory subject at school.The common problem for those young people is that they don’t know how to spend money in right way. As we can see many advertisements often carry out the message, “Only 10 dollars a week, no deposits” which is misleading think that living in debt is normal. Financial education is one of the solutions for . The basic idea of financial education as a core school subject is to teach those young ones to understand the concept of using money and to estimate a risk of borrowing money to buy something in the future.However, another factor we need . In my opinion, the role of financial education is getting more important and it should be a part of the school program but the parents are also important and have responsibility to how to manage the money. More than 70% of young people’s money is from their parents. In addition, it has to be considered that a student might become person, talking about money all the time in class or even in a public place. It can be harmful for some students and affect their normal social life.In conclusion, I that financial education will have a positive effect on all young ones and other such social commutations should be considered just as important as financial education.;"The discussion about financial education has become increasingly serious in many countries due to the financial problems faced by the young generation. Some argue that financial education should be a mandatory subject in schools. A common issue among young people is their lack of knowledge on how to manage their money effectively. Misleading advertisements, such as ""Only $10 a week, no deposits,"" can create the false impression that living in debt is normal. Financial education is seen as a solution to this problem. The core idea of teaching financial education in schools is to equip young people with an understanding of money management and the risks associated with borrowing.However, another crucial factor to consider is the role of parents in teaching their children about financial responsibility. In my opinion, the importance of financial education is growing, and it should be incorporated into school curricula. Nevertheless, parents also play a vital role in managing money and should take responsibility for teaching their children about financial literacy. It is estimated that over 70% of young people's money comes from their parents, highlighting the significance of parental involvement.Moreover, it is essential to consider the potential consequences of teaching financial education in schools. For instance, constantly discussing money in class or public places can be harmful to some students and may affect their social life. In conclusion, I believe that financial education will have a positive impact on young people, and other social skills, such as communication and responsibility, should be considered equally important.

1404;Full time university students spend most of the time studying. They should be doing other activities too. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Full time study in university is a great experience in life but in parallel to that students other activities such as working for their pocket money, sports, participating in debates and . People differ in their opinion if students must in other things or stay concentrated on their studies only. The discussion will be presented below, followed by my opinion.Some people say that mere studying does not youth for a country. This way, students only earn theoretical knowledge not practical. For instance, students can be their studies but at the same time when they , they fail and cannot develop their confidence and work as brilliantly as they were in university. Hence, the best approach for them to be engaged here and there for practical experience.On the other hand, others believe that building a better career is the foremost thing in today’s world. So, they are targeted to their studies and gain as much knowledge as they can. Furthermore, if they are diverted from their studies, they will not be able to their .In my point of view, there must be blending of full time education and extra activities. It refreshes students’ minds and provides more energy . Moreover, by this way, they will learn how to with other people in the society.To summarize, it can be said that it is important to concentrate on but on the other hand there must be something to keep active and relaxed being involved in games, music, work and other extra activities.;Pursuing full-time university studies is a valuable life experience, but it can be complemented by other activities, such as part-time work, sports, debates, and other extracurricular pursuits. Opinions differ on whether students should focus solely on their studies or engage in other activities. The following discussion will present various perspectives, followed by my personal opinion.Some argue that merely studying does not prepare young people for the demands of the real world. By only acquiring theoretical knowledge, students lack practical experience. For example, students may excel in their studies, but when faced with real-world challenges, they may struggle and fail to develop the confidence and skills they need to succeed. Therefore, the best approach is for students to balance their studies with other activities to gain practical experience.On the other hand, others believe that building a successful career is the top priority in today's competitive world. As a result, they focus exclusively on their studies, aiming to acquire as much knowledge as possible. Moreover, if they are distracted from their studies, they may not achieve their academic goals.In my opinion, there should be a balance between full-time education and extracurricular activities. This balance refreshes students' minds, provides them with more energy, and teaches them how to interact with others in society.In summary, it is essential to focus on studies, but it is also important to stay active and relaxed by engaging in activities such as sports, music, part-time work, and other extracurricular pursuits. This balance is crucial for students' overall development and success.
1293;Having a salaried job is better than being self-employed. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;If one wants to work for money, there are really only two options, working for someone else for a salary and being self-employed. Most people are involved with these two options and they both have advantages and disadvantages.Being self-employed means that the worker owns the business that is being done. This might be a small one-person business or a large company with hundreds of employees. The first advantage of this is the capacity to earn more money. If the business does very well, the income can be considerable and the owner of the company will receive the benefits. On the other hand, if business is not good, the owner’s income will be low. Self-employed people also have the benefit to some extent of choosing their working hours and holidays and they have the right to change anything within their business. With this autonomy, however, comes the pressure to succeed and the reliance on one’s employees, if there are any, to do their best to make the business thrive.Salaried workers do not experience the same stress as the self-employed owners of companies. They might have stress in their duties, but the pressure that comes with keeping one’s own business operating successfully in order to support oneself and one’s family is just not felt by an employee. The employee also has a certain knowledge of his or her income, as the salary is usually fixed every month. The self-employed owner’s income often depends on how successful the business is. The employee’s fixed income, however, does not give much scope for earning large amounts more. In addition, an employee does not have the freedoms of the owner or the autonomy, and for many people, having control over their lives is a significant factor to their well-being.It is certain that there are advantages and disadvantages for both being self-employed and salaried. I personally disagree that being salaried is better than being self-employed. I prefer the autonomy that being self-employed brings and, although there is more risk and pressure, this can lead to greater and more fulfilling rewards.;When it comes to earning a living, individuals essentially have two options: working for someone else in exchange for a salary or being self-employed. The majority of people fall into one of these two categories, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages.Self-employment means being the owner of the business, which can range from a small, one-person operation to a large corporation with hundreds of employees. One of the primary benefits of self-employment is the potential to earn a higher income. If the business is successful, the owner can reap significant financial rewards. However, if the business struggles, the owner's income will suffer accordingly. Self-employed individuals also have the flexibility to choose their working hours and vacations, as well as the autonomy to make changes within their business. This independence comes with a price, though - the pressure to succeed and the reliance on employees (if any) to perform well and contribute to the business's success.In contrast, salaried workers do not experience the same level of stress as self-employed business owners. While they may encounter stress in their job responsibilities, they do not bear the burden of keeping their own business afloat to support themselves and their families. Salaried workers also have the security of a fixed monthly income, whereas the self-employed owner's income is often tied to the business's performance. Although this fixed income provides stability, it also limits the potential for significant financial gains. Additionally, salaried workers lack the freedoms and autonomy that come with being a business owner, which can be a crucial factor in overall well-being for many individuals.Ultimately, both self-employment and salaried work have their advantages and disadvantages. Personally, I disagree with the notion that being salaried is superior to being self-employed. I value the autonomy that comes with self-employment and, despite the increased risk and pressure, believe it can lead to more substantial and fulfilling rewards.
1339;High-rise vs. low-rise buildings, which solution is better for a growing population?;Some cities create new housing for their growing populations by constructing a smaller number of high-rise buildings. Other cities create more of low-rise buildings. Which solution is better, in your opinion?Sample EssayRising population in urban areas leaves governments with no choice but to build more houses to meet the demand. However, when it comes to construction, there is more than one way to build new homes. Some cities prefer to construct fewer residential towers, while others build a larger number of low-rises for their residents. In this essay both options will be discussed and a viable solution will be suggested.One advantage of tall buildings is that they can accommodate a large number of people while having a small footprint. This type of construction is popular in central city areas where land is scarce and expensive. For example, in New York City high-rise buildings have significantly reduced housing problems, by as much as 55% in the last few years. As a result of this strategy, rents tend to decrease which has a further positive impact on the economies of such cities. However, tall buildings offer little or no privacy, they force certain rules and regulations upon residents, and attract higher maintenance costs.Given a chance to voice their opinion, many individuals would prefer to live in low-rise buildings or even build their own houses. This option might be more attractive for big families and for older generation people who like to have their own personal space. Accessibility is also a concern for the elderly as taking the stairs when the lifts break down may not be an option for them. In addition, one or two-story houses are easier and cheaper to maintain compared to modern apartment towers. The downside of this type of dwellings is that they occupy much more land, and since land is cheaper on city fringes, new estates tend to be built away from city centres. This increases commute time to work for their residents and negatively affects their quality of life.In conclusion, high-rise and low-rise buildings have their unique advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, high rises are more suitable for younger residents and should be built in the areas where young population is prevalent, closer to the city centre and employment opportunities. Senior citizens should have a supply of lower dwellings available in quieter locations. Such flexible approach can be a good way to address the needs of growing city’s population.;The increasing population in urban areas has led governments to seek solutions to meet the rising demand for housing. Two common approaches are to construct either a small number of high-rise buildings or a larger number of low-rise buildings. In this essay, we will discuss the pros and cons of both options and suggest a viable solution.One of the advantages of high-rise buildings is their ability to accommodate a large number of residents while occupying a relatively small area of land. This makes them an attractive option for central city areas where land is scarce and expensive. For instance, in New York City, the construction of high-rise buildings has led to a significant reduction in housing shortages, with a decrease of up to 55% in recent years. As a result, rents have decreased, which has had a positive impact on the local economy. However, high-rise buildings have their drawbacks, including limited privacy, strict rules and regulations, and higher maintenance costs.On the other hand, many individuals prefer to live in low-rise buildings or have their own houses. This option is particularly appealing to large families and older adults who value their personal space. Additionally, low-rise buildings are generally more accessible for the elderly, who may struggle with stairs in the event of a lift breakdown. Furthermore, one or two-story houses are easier and more cost-effective to maintain compared to high-rise apartment towers. Nevertheless, low-rise buildings occupy more land, which can lead to the development of new estates on the outskirts of cities, increasing commute times and negatively affecting residents' quality of life.In conclusion, both high-rise and low-rise buildings have their unique advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, high-rise buildings are more suitable for younger residents and should be constructed in areas with a high concentration of young people, closer to city centers and job opportunities. On the other hand, senior citizens should have access to lower-rise dwellings in quieter locations. A flexible approach that caters to the diverse needs of a growing city's population could be an effective way to address the housing shortage. Alternatively, here is a more significant rewrite of the text:The world's cities are experiencing unprecedented growth, with populations swelling and putting pressure on housing stocks. To address this challenge, urban planners are exploring different construction strategies. Two dominant approaches have emerged: building a small number of high-rise buildings or constructing a larger number of low-rise buildings. This essay will examine the pros and cons of each approach and propose a solution that balances the needs of diverse urban populations.High-rise buildings offer a
1365;IELTS Essay, topic: Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between the rich and poor, while others disagree (discuss);Some believe that modern technology is increasing the gap between rich and poor people, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.There is no doubt that modern technology is reshaping our planet and affecting every aspect of human lives. From a social perspective, many people argue that the gap between the upper class and lower classes is widening as a result of technological advancements. Others, however, believe the opposite.There are several reasons why one could think that the wealth inequality is, indeed, increasing. The most common reason is automation. Driven by technology, automation reduces the need for manual labour. As a result, less work opportunities are available for unskilled people. With each iteration of the cycle the competition increases and wages decrease. , technology has increased the minimum level of needs that should be satisfied. Nowadays, everybody should have a mobile phone and an internet connection, including the poor. This increases the monetary burden on them as they must borrow to cover these new needs.However, I firmly believe that the aforementioned opinion is ludicrous. The most obvious reason is that modern technology has facilitated the road to riches in an unprecedented manner. For instance, many of the internet billionaires are from lower and middle classes. Moreover, the major leaps in agricultural technologies magnified food production. As a result, food has become more affordable and available. Finally, leveraging technology has dramatically increased workers’ productivity. Consequently, compensations and salaries have increased.In conclusion, I strongly believe that technology could possibly narrow the difference between social classes. Increased food production, opportunities and productivity are just few examples of technology’s contribution to bridging the wealth gap.This essay adequately covers all parts of the task. The ideas expressed in this written response are relevant, well-developed, ordered in a logical way and supported. The paragraphing is suitable and cohesion is maintained throughout the essay. A good range of vocabulary and the writer’s fluency are evident. There are no spelling errors and very few mistakes in word choice and grammar, most sentences are error-free. The essay is likely to get Band 8 in IELTS.;The debate about whether modern technology is exacerbating the disparity between the rich and the poor has sparked intense discussion, with some advocating for the notion that it widens the gap, while others contend the opposite. This essay aims to delve into both perspectives and provide an opinion on the matter.From a societal standpoint, a plethora of individuals argue that technological advancements are contributing to the widening chasm between the affluent and the impoverished. On the other hand, there are those who firmly believe that technology is bridging this gap. Several compelling arguments suggest that the wealth disparity is indeed increasing due to technological progress. A primary concern is the rise of automation, driven by technological innovation, which diminishes the necessity for manual labor. As a consequence, fewer job opportunities are available for unskilled workers, leading to heightened competition and decreased wages. Furthermore, technology has elevated the baseline of necessities, with modern society deeming it essential for everyone, including the poor, to possess a mobile phone and internet connection. This imposes an additional financial burden, as they are compelled to borrow to meet these novel needs.However, the opinion that technology is widening the wealth gap is, in my opinion, misguided. A more plausible perspective is that modern technology has unprecedentedly facilitated social mobility. For instance, numerous internet billionaires have emerged from lower and middle-class backgrounds, exemplifying the potential for technological innovation to foster economic ascent. Moreover, significant advancements in agricultural technology have substantially increased food production, rendering it more affordable and accessible. Lastly, the strategic leveraging of technology has dramatically augmented worker productivity, culminating in enhanced compensations and salaries.In conclusion, I firmly believe that technology has the potential to narrow the socioeconomic divide. The proliferation of opportunities, increased food production, and heightened productivity are testaments to technology's role in bridging the wealth disparity. This perspective is grounded in the empirical evidence that technological innovation has empowered individuals from diverse backgrounds to ascend the economic ladder and has improved the overall standard of living. Ultimately, the benefits of technology can be harnessed to create a more equitable society, where the gap between the rich and the poor is continually diminishing. 
1388;In many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion?;Nowadays, many children involved in different types of jobs to have some kind of financial assurance for themselves. However, whether this is good for their development and personality is a controversial issue. I personally believe that paid works is harmful for children for several reasons.It is said that children gain valuable experience in the work place. This may be true. However, I would argue that children are mainly employed in jobs that require manual work and are poorly paid. The recent statistics reveal the common tasks that children are assigned to are washing dishes, mopping floors or serving food in restaurants. Meanwhile, this kind of jobs actually provide children with necessary and useful skills to apply in their future .This brings me to the second point. Defenders of child labour that it is an effective method of learning. The point is children should be able to apply knowledge taught to them in a real life working environment. Although this is undoubtedly true, it also means that children may neglect the classroom study and even fail the class. The worst thing is yet to come. They may become so preoccupied with the benefits ahead of them such as small salary that they may leave school.Finally, supporters say that it helps them to build responsibility in the family. They will understand how it is difficult to earn money and therefore have compassion for their parents. This is true to a certain extent, but may have a totally adverse effect on children. As children can make money at an early age, they would feel that it is appropriate to spend it on luxury things.In conclusion, I think that parents should take measures to restrict their child from work, otherwise it would have negative consequences to their future.;In today's society, many children are engaged in various types of jobs to secure some form of financial stability for themselves. However, the question of whether this is beneficial for their development and personality remains a topic of debate. Personally, I believe that paid work is detrimental to children for several reasons.While it is argued that children gain valuable experience in the workplace, I would counter that most child labor involves manual work and is poorly paid. Recent statistics show that common tasks assigned to children include washing dishes, mopping floors, or serving food in restaurants. Although these jobs may provide children with useful skills for their future, they are often not the kind of work that fosters intellectual or emotional growth.This leads me to my second point: the argument that child labor is an effective method of learning. Proponents claim that children should be able to apply the knowledge they have learned in a real-life working environment. While it is true that hands-on experience can be valuable, it also means that children may neglect their classroom studies and even fail their classes. The worst outcome is that they may become so preoccupied with the benefits of earning a small salary that they drop out of school altogether.Lastly, supporters of child labor argue that it helps children develop a sense of responsibility within their family. By understanding the difficulties of earning money, they may develop compassion for their parents' struggles. Although this may be true to some extent, it can also have an adverse effect on children. If children can earn money at a young age, they may feel entitled to spend it on luxuries, rather than saving or using it wisely.In conclusion, I firmly believe that parents should take steps to restrict their child from working, as it can have severe negative consequences on their future development and well-being. It is crucial for parents and society as a whole to prioritize children's education and personal growth over the short-term benefits of child labor.
1411;In many countries children are engaged in some kind of paid work. Some people regard this as completely wrong, while others consider it to be a valuable work experience, which is important for learning and taking responsibility. What is your opinion on this?;In the Third World, children are usually sent to factories for laborious work. Many people believe that it is merely exploitation, while others think it is a good opportunity for them to life experience. In any case, children have their right to live and study in peaceful conditions. Therefore, using them as workforce is considered an unacceptable action.First of all, children are not workers. They have just learned about the vast world and do not have any experience or concept of working. Since these innocent children are naive and , they can be easily cheated and exploited. There are many examples of this in poor nations. Because using children is cheap and to control, many enterprises hire them and don’t pay them much. Although the government in these countries has tried its best, this kind of taking advantage of children cannot be eliminated.Moreover, children do not need such thing as ‘valuable work experience’ that is supposedly ‘important for learning and taking responsibility’. The brief responsibility of children is learning. They are not old enough to understand what working experiences are. Nevertheless, they can help parents do chores or housework. This will be a much better way for them to become more responsible for . In addition, childhood is one of the most remarkable memories and must not be taken away by forcing them to work.In conclusion, since all children are the great concern of parent and society, they should be allowed to enjoy life and rather than to work. Hence, one must ponder what view is actually appropriate for the sake of the children.;"In developing countries, it is a common practice to send children to factories to perform demanding labor. While some people view this as a valuable learning experience, others see it as outright exploitation. Regardless of perspective, children have the fundamental right to live and study in peaceful environments, making their use as a workforce unacceptable.Children are not suited for work, having only recently begun to explore the world and lacking the experience and understanding of what it means to work. Their innocence and naivety make them vulnerable to exploitation, as evidenced by numerous examples in impoverished nations. Companies often take advantage of this, hiring children at low costs and exerting control over them with minimal compensation. Despite government efforts to combat this issue, the exploitation of children persists.Moreover, children do not require ""valuable work experience"" to learn and take responsibility. Their primary responsibility is to learn, and they are not yet mature enough to comprehend the concept of work experience. However, assisting their parents with household chores can be a more suitable way for them to develop a sense of responsibility. Furthermore, childhood is a precious and memorable time that should not be sacrificed by forcing children into labor.In conclusion, considering the well-being of children is a top priority for both parents and society, they should be allowed to enjoy their childhood and focus on their education rather than being forced to work. Ultimately, it is essential to reflect on what approach is truly in the best interest of children."
361;In many countries people increasingly talk about money (how much they earn or how much they pay for things in their daily conversations). Why? Is this a positive or negative development?;"Money can not buy happiness! Is one of the most famous sayings while talking about finances. It is argued that topics around money, wealth, and poverty are becoming dramatically more frequent between humans in different countries around the world. In my opinion, the extream part of it is a negative development; although, it has some positivities. I will address some of both sides in this essay.Talking about money during the major part of the day might make the person look stingy and this is an attitude that majority of the community would not like, thus, might effect on the person's social life. Moreover, having the same topic in mind all day might lead to an obsession, and as a result, this could lead to a depression because the person might not find the proper way to reach to the financial position that meets their satisfaction, which could lead to depression, or even worse such as going through illegal paths where it could destroy their lives entirely!Nevertheless, the person should be aware of his /her income and spendings and try to enhance their financial position to the best possible way. Also, the inflation that we are currently living and the noticable increase in prices could be a driver for people to talk about money more often.In conclusion, people should not be obssessed in money and to talk with everyone about it all the time. However, I believe that people should discuss this matter in order to benefit from each other, and to find more ways to enhance their quality of life.";"The age-old adage ""Money can't buy happiness"" is a popular saying when discussing financial matters. The topic of money, wealth, and poverty has become increasingly prevalent in conversations among people from different countries worldwide. In my opinion, the extreme focus on this topic has both negative and positive aspects, which I will explore in this essay.Excessive discussion of money can have negative consequences on a person's social life, as it may give the impression of being stingy, an attitude that is often frowned upon by the community. Moreover, constant preoccupation with financial matters can lead to an unhealthy obsession, potentially resulting in depression. This is because the individual may become fixated on achieving a financial status that meets their expectations, and if they fail to do so, they may resort to desperate measures, including illegal activities that can have devastating consequences.On the other hand, it is essential for individuals to be aware of their income and expenses, and to strive to improve their financial situation in a responsible and sustainable way. The current economic climate, marked by inflation and rising prices, can also motivate people to discuss financial matters more frequently. By sharing knowledge and experiences, individuals can learn from each other and discover new ways to enhance their quality of life.In conclusion, while an excessive focus on money can be detrimental, I believe that discussing financial matters can be beneficial when done in moderation. By striking a balance between being mindful of one's financial situation and not becoming overly obsessed with it, individuals can reap the benefits of sharing experiences and knowledge, ultimately leading to a better quality of life."
671;In many countries women and men are working full time. It is therefore, logical for women and men to share household works. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;I strongly agree with this statement. If women and men are both working full time, they should share household works.First of all, if women and men are working full time, and they are working in the same amount of time, logically, the amount of time they do household works should be the sam e. However, if one of them work for longer hours, the household works should still be shared but the other one should do more household works.Second of all, everyone have responsibility to do household works because everyone lives in the house, makes the house dirty, creates dirty clothes and dishes. If there is only either women or men doing household works, it is not fair at all, because they both work full time.But as I mentioned before, the amount of time doing household works can be arranged, it doesn't have to be evenly shared. For instance, if the woman in this family work for longer hours or got an extra call by work, the man should help and do her part of household works. And when the man are working more, the woman should do the same. This does not only solve the problem of who should do household works but can also show that women and men are supporting each other in various situations.In conclusion, when women and men are both doing full time jobs, they should share household works. But it doesn't have to to be split in two halves, it can have alternatives depending on the working hours or special situations. In this way, the house can be more peaceful and have more harmony without arguments about who should do the household works.;I wholeheartedly endorse the idea that women and men should share household responsibilities when they both work full-time. Logically, if they dedicate the same amount of time to their jobs, they should also allocate equal time to household chores. However, if one partner works longer hours, it's reasonable to adjust the distribution of household tasks accordingly, with the other partner taking on more responsibilities.It's essential to recognize that both women and men have a responsibility to contribute to household work, as they both reside in the house, generate mess, and create dirty laundry and dishes. Assigning household tasks solely to one partner is unfair, especially when both work full-time. A more equitable approach is to share the workload, taking into account the specific circumstances of each partner's work schedule.The division of household labor doesn't necessarily need to be a 50-50 split. Rather, it can be adapted to accommodate varying work hours or special situations. For instance, if the woman in the household works longer hours or receives an unexpected work call, the man can step in to assist with her share of the household tasks. Conversely, when the man is working extended hours, the woman can reciprocate by taking on more household responsibilities. This not only resolves the issue of who should perform household tasks but also demonstrates the mutual support and cooperation between partners in diverse situations.In conclusion, when women and men both work full-time, sharing household responsibilities is crucial for maintaining harmony and peace in the home. The key is to find a balance that works for both partners, taking into account their unique circumstances and work schedules. By doing so, households can become more peaceful and collaborative, free from disputes over who should perform household tasks.
1343;In many countries young people start living on their own after high school, is this a positive or negative development?;In many countries around the world young people decide to leave their parents’ home once they finish school. They start living on their own or sharing a house with friends. Is this a positive or a negative development? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples.Sample EssayNowadays it is becoming increasingly common for youngsters to start their independent life by moving out of their parents’ home after graduation from school. This trend has positive effects on the society and the reasons behind it will be discussed next in this essay.There are various benefits for both young people and their parents when individuals start living independently after finishing school. Young adults, in this way, have to take care of their daily needs, from house chores, cooking or cleaning to financial independence. Thus, instead of wasting time on childish activities, they are motivated to learn skills and work part-time or full-time in order to cover their living expenses. Although it might seem challenging for them to live on their own at first, it would give them valuable experience, helping them to become mature, responsible adults. Parents would also be pleased with this practice since they can enjoy their own lives by having more time for themselves. Not only would they have more financial flexibility due to independence of their children, but they also don’t have to change their habits in order to adapt to the new generation’s lifestyle. For instance, it allows many people to travel around the world, which would be impossible if their children were to stay with them after finishing high school.Admittedly, there might be some challenges involved in this way of life. In some cases and especially under the influence of new friends or housemates, youngsters might choose to get involved in dangerous activities that involve drugs or petty crimes. However, instead of keeping their children close through adulthood, parents should prepare in advance and raise their children to distinguish between right and wrong and teach them to take responsibility for their actions.In conclusion, although there might be some adverse consequences to this relatively new practice, I believe that the advantages of young people leaving family home outweigh its drawbacks, for both children and parents.;In many countries, it has become a common practice for young people to leave their family home after completing their education. They often choose to live independently or share a house with friends. But is this trend a positive or negative development? This essay will argue that it is a positive development, providing reasons and examples to support this claim.The decision of young adults to start living independently after finishing school has numerous benefits for both themselves and their parents. By taking care of their daily needs, such as household chores, cooking, and cleaning, as well as managing their finances, young adults are motivated to acquire new skills and secure part-time or full-time employment to cover their living expenses. Although the initial transition to independent living may be challenging, it provides valuable experience that helps them mature into responsible adults. Meanwhile, parents can enjoy their own lives, having more time for themselves and greater financial flexibility due to their children's independence. For example, many people can travel the world, which would be difficult if their children were still living with them after high school.While there are potential challenges associated with this lifestyle, such as the risk of young people engaging in dangerous activities like drug use or petty crimes under the influence of new friends or housemates, parents should prepare their children in advance to make responsible decisions. Rather than keeping their children close through adulthood, parents should teach them to distinguish right from wrong and take responsibility for their actions.In conclusion, despite some potential drawbacks, the advantages of young people leaving the family home after finishing school outweigh the disadvantages, benefiting both the children and the parents. This trend promotes independence, responsibility, and personal growth, ultimately leading to a more mature and self-sufficient younger generation.
1320;In many countries, a lot of food is wasted. Why do people waste food? How can we reduce the amount of food waste?;"Despite the fact that millions of people in the world go hungry every day, a surprisingly large amount of food gets wasted daily in certain parts of the world. In my opinion, the main reason for this is that people in the first-world countries tend to only buy food that is aesthetically pleasing, and fortunately, there are some ways to tackle this issue.It is shockingly sad to know that large amounts of perfectly edible food in the form of fresh produce get sent to landfills, and the main reason for this is that these foods do not meet the standards of perfection set for fruits and vegetables by consumers and grocery stores. For example, veggies and fruit that are misshapen or have a few spots on them are still good enough to eat, yet they are often left on shelves to rot in favour of something that looks less damaged. In addition, a lot of customers confuse the ‘best by’ and ‘use by’ dates, thinking that foods that have passed their ‘best by’ dates are no longer fit to eat. Another major reason for food wastage is that people often overestimate the amount of produce they require on a weekly or monthly basis, and most of it ends up getting thrown out instead of being used.There are many ways to reduce the amount of food being wasted, and I think one of the best ideas is to increase people’s awareness of just how much good food is disposed of, only because of our superficial biases as to how food should look. Raising the awareness of the staggering number of people that go hungry in third-world countries would make it harder to throw away an apple just because it is a little bruised. Also, teaching people how to better plan their monthly food requirements would help them not to overspend on food that they do not need; it would be great for the environment and their budget. The role of the government in this endeavour is indispensable as such task would be too great for any smaller organisation.To conclude, the wasting food is a serious issue that merits increased awareness from both people and the leaders of the world. It is unacceptable to discard any food when there are so many people who are starving, and hopefully our joint effort can help improve the current situation.";It is alarming to note that, despite widespread hunger affecting millions of people globally, a substantial amount of food is wasted daily in certain regions. In my view, the primary cause of this issue is the tendency of individuals in developed countries to prioritize the aesthetic appeal of food, but fortunately, there are potential solutions to address this problem.The fact that large quantities of perfectly edible food, including fresh produce, are discarded in landfills is disturbing. This occurs because these items fail to meet the stringent standards of perfection imposed by consumers and grocery stores. For instance, vegetables and fruits that are misshapen or have minor blemishes are still suitable for consumption, yet they are often left to spoil in favor of more visually appealing alternatives. Furthermore, many consumers mistakenly interpret the 'best by' and 'use by' dates, believing that food past its 'best by' date is no longer edible. Another significant contributor to food waste is the common practice of overestimating weekly or monthly produce requirements, resulting in a substantial portion being discarded.To mitigate food waste, I believe that raising awareness about the extent of good food discarded due to superficial biases regarding appearance is crucial. By acknowledging the vast number of people struggling with hunger in underdeveloped countries, it becomes more difficult to justify discarding food based on minor imperfections. Additionally, educating individuals on how to better plan their food needs can help prevent overspending on unnecessary items, which would be beneficial for both the environment and personal budgets. The government's role in this endeavor is vital, as the task is too significant for smaller organizations to tackle alone.In conclusion, food waste is a pressing issue that demands increased awareness from both the general public and global leaders. It is unacceptable to discard food when millions of people are struggling with hunger. Hopefully, our collective efforts can contribute to improving the current situation and reducing the staggering amount of food waste.
1331;In many countries, young people are finding it harder and harder to find permanent jobs. Why is this happening? What can be done to improve the situation?;In this fast-moving age, with the development of education and modern technologies, people strive to have a secure job after graduating from colleges and universities. Despite their efforts, so many young adults in different parts of the world have a negative experience of finding a long-term job.It so happens that most colleges and universities focus on students’ academic performance much more than their practical skills. Unfortunately, many companies reserve permanent job opportunities for experienced applicants because there is no need to invest much in their training. Lack of practical experience in new graduates puts them at a disadvantage as far as companies are concerned. The situation is made worse by the abundance of advanced technologies that can easily replace human labor. Robots and computers work more efficiently and with higher precision than humans. That shrinks the pool of available job placements even more, as companies only need to hire highly educated and experienced staff.Fortunately, there is a number of solutions that can help inexperienced workers gain permanent employment. An obvious one is that universities could offer internships to their students, or arrange workshops in addition to classwork. This would help students to get training and experience in their respective fields. Also, the government could examine the demands of changing labor market and steer young people towards professions that will be popular in the coming years. Together with colleges and universities the government could create special awareness programs for graduates, providing them with an overview of various job offers and their benefits. This way students would be able to choose the right jobs for themselves.To sum up, lack of demand in the labour market and insufficient experience are two major reasons why many young people have trouble finding a permanent position. Helping them gain hands-on experience as part of their studies and educating them about career options early on is key to improving the employment outcome for them.;In today's fast-paced world, where education and technology are constantly evolving, people are eager to secure a stable job after graduating from college or university. However, many young adults worldwide face significant challenges in finding long-term employment. The primary issue lies in the fact that most educational institutions prioritize academic achievement over practical skills, leaving new graduates with limited experience. As a result, companies tend to reserve permanent positions for seasoned applicants, as they require less training and investment. The lack of practical experience among new graduates puts them at a disadvantage in the eyes of employers. Furthermore, the increasing presence of advanced technologies, such as robots and computers, which can perform tasks more efficiently and accurately than humans, exacerbates the situation. This reduces the number of available job openings, as companies only need to hire highly educated and experienced personnel.Fortunately, there are potential solutions that can aid inexperienced workers in securing permanent employment. One approach is for universities to offer internships or workshops in conjunction with regular coursework, enabling students to gain hands-on experience in their respective fields. Additionally, the government could analyze the demands of the changing labor market and guide young people towards professions that are likely to be in high demand in the future. In collaboration with educational institutions, the government could establish awareness programs for graduates, providing them with an overview of various job opportunities and their benefits. This would enable students to make informed decisions about their career paths.In conclusion, the lack of demand in the labor market and insufficient experience are the primary reasons why many young people struggle to find permanent employment. Providing them with hands-on experience as part of their studies and educating them about career options from an early stage is crucial to improving their employment prospects. By addressing these issues, we can empower young adults to secure stable and fulfilling careers.
1318;In many workplaces online communication has overtaken face to face meetings. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?;In today’s ever-increasingly digital world, online communication has become the norm for many workplaces. While this development offers numerous advantages for companies such as greater flexibility and efficiency, it also brings with it certain disadvantages like miscommunication, which must be weighed against its benefits.One of the primary advantages of online communication is that it makes it easier for teams to stay in touch without having to physically convene. This is especially beneficial when individuals or groups are dispersed across vast distances. Reduced travel costs, as well as time saved from not having to travel to and from meetings, also represent meaningful savings for businesses. Additionally, online communication platforms often have a range of features designed to make collaboration more efficient, such as providing an easy way to share documents and other materials with remote team members. To illustrate, digital resources can be sent quickly and securely via email or other software services like Dropbox or Google Drive.There is a potential drawback associated with relying too heavily on online communication at work, as the lack of physical proximity between members of a team can often lead to misunderstandings due to a loss of context or nonverbal cues that would otherwise be present during face-to-face meetings. However, in my opinion, issues of this nature can be solved by using written language more carefully to avoid any confusion or miscommunication among colleagues.In conclusion, when online communication tools are used properly, they undoubtedly provide companies with greater flexibility in how their teams collaborate without sacrificing clarity of communication, quality or efficiency.;The shift towards a digital world has led to the widespread adoption of online communication in many workplaces. While this trend offers numerous benefits, including increased flexibility and efficiency, it also presents certain drawbacks, such as the potential for miscommunication. To fully appreciate the value of online communication, it is essential to weigh these advantages and disadvantages.One of the most significant benefits of online communication is its ability to facilitate seamless communication among team members, regardless of their physical location. This is particularly advantageous for teams that are geographically dispersed. The reduction in travel costs and time spent commuting to and from meetings also translates to substantial savings for businesses. Moreover, online communication platforms typically offer a range of features designed to enhance collaboration, including the ability to easily share documents and materials with remote team members. For instance, digital resources can be swiftly and securely shared via email or cloud storage services like Dropbox or Google Drive.However, there is a potential downside to relying excessively on online communication in the workplace. The lack of face-to-face interaction can lead to misunderstandings due to the absence of nonverbal cues and contextual information that are typically present in in-person meetings. Nevertheless, in my view, these issues can be mitigated by using written language with greater care and precision to avoid confusion and miscommunication among colleagues.In summary, when utilized effectively, online communication tools undoubtedly provide companies with greater flexibility in team collaboration without compromising communication clarity, quality, or efficiency. By leveraging these tools, businesses can harness the benefits of online communication while minimizing its drawbacks.
713;In many workplaces, online communication is getting more common than meeting face to face. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?;According to COVID-19 event forced many company to change their way of working. One of the most significant transformation is the communication. The online communication becomes a must or inevitable for the company to be implemented. In this topic, we're going to disscuss the advantages and disadvantages for both ways of communications. The online meeting can introduce a significant impact to the organization while face to face meeting can be outdated for this new era of 2021.First of all for the online communication's advantages is that in the pandemic period the actual physical contact is a significant way to transmit the disease. Video conference can help mitigate this problem by lower the physical contact for each conversation or meeting. Also communicates through online channel can help individual to organize or manage their time efficiently according to each person preference. For example, a single mom parent may be able to spend times for her sons/daughters at home, while be able to have a cross country meeting with another department in other region. Another reason is that some people are quite introvert and find it difficult for face to face human interactions or conversations, in which online chat or messages can help them to mitigate this problem and communicate efficiently. Lastly as mentioned about video conference across region, online meeting can help the multi-national corporates save the transporations cost and additional resources needed to spend for face to face meeting.For the disadvantages, all of the online communications required hardware, internet connection and technological knowledge on how to use them. This technological gap can be seen as one of the most significant obstracle or disadvantage for people to use online communications. For example, in one company, there obviously have a various age of people, in which some of them are not familiar with the technology. Since video call conference has been introduced and utilized widespread among corporates not so long time ago. This can be a big technological gap for some people to use the online communications and result in a lost in communications among the workplaces.As a result, online communication helps an organization to reduce the risk of transmitting the disease, improved the time mangement ability and productivity for each individuals, and lower the financial cost or resources required to spends for international business activities. With all these advantages of online communication stated, they can be seens as a significant reasons to outweight the disadvantages of technological gap on this current year of 2021.;The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many companies to reassess their work processes, with one of the most notable transformations being in communication. Online communication has become an essential tool for companies to adopt. This discussion will explore the advantages and disadvantages of both online and face-to-face communication methods, considering the significant impact of online meetings on organizations and the potential outdated nature of in-person meetings in the modern era.The advantages of online communication are multifaceted. During the pandemic, reducing physical contact is crucial to prevent the spread of the disease, and video conferencing has been instrumental in minimizing face-to-face interactions. Online communication also enables individuals to manage their time more efficiently, according to their personal preferences. For instance, a single parent can attend to their children at home while participating in cross-country meetings with other departments. Additionally, online communication platforms, such as chat and messaging services, can facilitate communication for introverted individuals who may struggle with in-person interactions. Lastly, online meetings can help multinational corporations save on transportation costs and additional resources required for in-person meetings.However, there are also disadvantages to online communication. The requirement for specific hardware, a stable internet connection, and technological proficiency can pose significant obstacles. This technological gap can be particularly challenging for individuals who are not familiar with the necessary technology, such as older employees who may not have grown up with the latest advancements. The relatively recent widespread adoption of video conferencing technology can exacerbate this issue, resulting in communication breakdowns in the workplace.In conclusion, online communication offers numerous benefits, including reduced disease transmission risk, improved time management and productivity, and lower financial costs for international business activities. Despite the disadvantages associated with technological gaps, the advantages of online communication outweigh the drawbacks, making it a vital tool for companies in the current era. As the world continues to navigate the challenges posed by the pandemic, the adoption and effective use of online communication strategies will be crucial for the success and sustainability of organizations.
1265;In recent years, the family structure has changed, as well as family roles. What are the changes occurring? Do you think these changes are positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In our modern days, families had witnessed a considerable change regarding their structure and the roles of individuals inside it. These changes are mainly the patriarchal structure that was dominating families in the past compared to a more balanced arrangement nowadays. In addition to that, there are more freedom and rights for women in recent years. And I believe its an advantageous development.Fathers used to be the only leaders of the families of past decades, however in recent days mothers had shared the leadership and started taking part in family decisions just like their partners. Also during recent decades women obtained greater deal of their civil rights which allowed them to take different roles from those that were common for females in the past decades. As an example, women can now own the family house, sign important documents, drive cars which were a breakthrough for women to be able to participate in family plannings and decisions.It appears to be an advantage to have women being able to be effective members of their families, that is because they can share responsibility, add their feminine qualities to the lives of their families as well as for them to be able to fulfill their own life by feeling the importance of their existence and their roles.As in a recent research that found families with women in them are happier, more content, and definitely healthier.In conclusion, the family system nowadays differs vastly from before, owing to the more roles that women are taking, and to the more rights and freedom they gained, and in my perspective it is a positive change.;In today's modern era, families have undergone significant transformations in terms of their structure and the roles of individuals within them. Notably, the traditional patriarchal structure that once dominated family dynamics has given way to a more balanced and equitable arrangement. Furthermore, women have gained greater freedom and rights in recent years, which I firmly believe is a beneficial development.Historically, fathers were the sole leaders of families, whereas nowadays, mothers have assumed a more equal role in leadership and decision-making, alongside their partners. Over the past few decades, women have made tremendous strides in securing their civil rights, enabling them to pursue diverse roles that were previously inaccessible to them. For instance, women can now own property, sign important documents, and drive cars, which has been a groundbreaking milestone in their participation in family planning and decision-making.It is evident that having women as active and influential members of their families is a significant advantage. This is because they can share responsibilities, bring their unique feminine perspectives to family life, and fulfill their own potential by feeling valued and recognized in their roles. Research has recently shown that families with empowered women are generally happier, more content, and healthier.In conclusion, the contemporary family system has undergone a profound shift from its traditional counterpart, largely due to the expanding roles and increased rights and freedoms of women. From my perspective, this evolution is a decidedly positive change, one that has far-reaching benefits for families and society as a whole.
1399;In some countries children have very strict rules of behavior, in other countries they are allowed to do almost anything they like. To what extent should children have to follow rules?;Freedom plays a pivotal role in everybody’s life. We can see in today’s modernized era that nobody likes to be restricted, whether it is a child or an adult. Some people think that there should some strict rules of behavior for children, but I disagree with this statement.that sometimes more restrictions can cause more frustration in children, which leads to many other mental problems as well. they can . Sometimes they feel under pressure, which can be the main reason for their poor performance in their field. In some cases children may insist on doing .In other words we have to look other aspects as well, if we usually ignore our children’s bad habits, then they good human beings in their future life. Moreover if we never draw attention the children’s main activities then they might end up in a bad company. They the value of respect for their elders importance of relationships. They their cultural values as well.In a nutshell, I would like to say that children should be the value of their customs, rituals and respect towards their elders for their future life, but most of the additional restriction should . It would good human beings in their future.;Freedom plays a vital role in every individual's life, and in today's modern era, it's evident that people of all ages dislike being restricted. While some believe that children should be subject to strict rules of behavior, I disagree. Excessive restrictions can lead to frustration in children, causing a range of mental health issues. Moreover, the pressure to conform can negatively impact their performance in various aspects of life. Children may rebel against overly restrictive environments, seeking freedom and autonomy.It's essential to consider the broader implications of our actions. Ignoring children's bad habits can ultimately lead to them developing into well-rounded individuals in the future. Conversely, neglecting their activities and behaviors can result in them falling into bad company, losing sight of the importance of respecting elders, and disregarding cultural values.In essence, children should be taught to appreciate their customs, rituals, and the value of respecting their elders to thrive in their future lives. However, excessive restrictions can be counterproductive. By striking a balance between guidance and freedom, we can help children develop into good human beings, equipped with the values and principles necessary to succeed in life.
681;In some countries people spend long hours at work. Why does this happen? Is it positive or negative development;Nowadays, many businesses have to compete each other in order to survive from the rapidly changing world, leading to the high amount of time that employees spend on working. There are also other reasons why the employees work for a long period which I will discuss in this essay. In terms of consequences, I personally believe that spending most of our time at work is the negative development.It is the fact that people have various rationales to work for long hours. A classic example is the dynamic working condition. There are many companies that provide services such as consultation to customers, meaning that if their service does not completely satisfy the clients’ need, such client may decide to use the service from other competitors. Hence, the employees are required to dedicate their time to deliver the best service to the clients. Another common criticism is a bright career path. When the employees work for a long period, they can carefully check their works and, as a result, delivery the works with less mistakes. Doing this way could impress their manager and they are likely to get promotion in return.With a careful consideration regarding the consequence of working for long hours, there are many vital drawbacks. An obvious effect is the increase in illness. People who work very hard have to spend a lot of their time at work. Therefore, they may not have enough time to do exercises, weakening the immune system of their body. Furthermore, with the rise in the amount of working hours, people tend to lack social skills. This is because they may not be able to manage time to join social events or meet their friends, resulting in the less ability to adapt to new environments.In conclusion, it is undeniable that people work for long hours because of the requirement in business and personal career goal which, in my opinion, leads to negative development for themselves. This is because this behavior negatively affects their health condition and social competency which are the two most important aspects in our life.;In today's fast-paced world, businesses are compelled to compete fiercely to survive, resulting in employees dedicating an excessive amount of time to their work. There are several reasons why employees work long hours, which will be explored in this essay. In my opinion, spending most of our time at work is a detrimental trend.People have various motivations for working long hours. One notable example is the dynamic nature of the work environment. Many companies offer services such as consulting, where failure to meet clients' needs can lead to a loss of business to competitors. Consequently, employees are required to devote significant time to delivering exceptional service to clients. Another common reason is the desire for career advancement. By working extended hours, employees can meticulously review their work, minimizing mistakes and increasing the likelihood of impressing their managers, which can lead to promotions.However, upon careful consideration of the consequences of working long hours, numerous significant drawbacks emerge. A glaring effect is the increased susceptibility to illness. Individuals who work excessively long hours often have insufficient time for physical exercise, weakening their immune system. Furthermore, the rise in working hours can lead to a decline in social skills, as people may not have time to attend social events or meet friends, resulting in reduced adaptability to new environments.In conclusion, it is undeniable that people work long hours due to business requirements and personal career goals, which, in my opinion, leads to negative consequences for themselves. This behavior adversely affects their physical and mental health, as well as their social competency, which are two of the most crucial aspects of life.
101;In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this .;Over decades, there has been a belief that adults should support adolescents to work in a company or travel to another country at least one year before going to university. Despite the fact that there are many positive aspects of having experiences in terms of working and travelling before studying at university, with a careful consideration, there are also negative points of this.It is true that working or travelling before starting a university program positively affects juveniles’ development. A classic example of this is an effective way to truly understand their academic preferences. When juveniles have work experiences, such as having a one-year internship in a company, they tend to learn a wide variety of work functions, helping them know the academic discipline they want to learn at university. Another benefit from taking a long journey to another place before studying at university is the opportunity to get exposed to new culture. This is because while adolescents are on an epic expedition to other parts of the world, they tend to meet new people with different nationality and belief, leading to valuable life experiences that they cannot receive from a professor at university.In spite of the aforementioned advantages of working or travelling before starting university courses, there are also drawbacks. A common example of this is graduating from a college late, compared to juveniles who immediately start a university program after they finish high school. This is exemplified by Thai culture which believes that young people who graduate from university later than their peer would not have a successful career path. In addition, opponents of this notion might argue that working before finishing university is not well worth doing. Since most works require a strong academic foundation in order for juveniles to deliver results with fewer mistakes, the juveniles should study at university instead.In conclusion, it is undeniable that having work experiences or taking a journey before starting a university life has many benefits for young people with respect to knowing the academic fields they want to study and learning new cultures outside a classroom. Nevertheless, doing this could also have drawbacks in terms of the delay in university graduation and an ineffective performance in working.;For decades, the notion that adults should encourage adolescents to work or travel for at least a year before attending university has been prevalent. While there are numerous benefits to gaining work and travel experience before starting university, a closer examination also reveals several drawbacks.It is undeniable that working or traveling before beginning university studies has a positive impact on juvenile development. For instance, gaining work experience, such as a one-year internship, can help young individuals discover their academic preferences. Through exposure to various work functions, they can better understand the academic discipline they wish to pursue at university. Moreover, embarking on a long journey to a foreign country before university can provide an opportunity to immerse oneself in a new culture. By interacting with people from diverse nationalities and backgrounds, adolescents can acquire invaluable life experiences that cannot be replicated in a university setting.However, despite these advantages, there are also significant disadvantages to consider. One notable con is the potential delay in graduating from university. Compared to peers who immediately start university after completing high school, those who take a gap year may graduate later, which can have negative implications for their career prospects. In some cultures, such as in Thailand, graduating later than one's peers is believed to hinder a successful career path. Furthermore, critics of this approach argue that working before completing university may not be worthwhile, as most jobs require a strong academic foundation to perform effectively and minimize mistakes. Therefore, it may be more beneficial for young individuals to focus on their university studies rather than gaining work experience beforehand.In conclusion, while having work or travel experiences before starting university can be highly beneficial for young people, providing insight into their desired field of study and exposure to new cultures, it is essential to acknowledge the potential drawbacks. These include delayed university graduation and potentially subpar performance in the workforce. Ultimately, a balanced consideration of both the advantages and disadvantages is necessary to make an informed decision.
1304;In some countries, boys and girls are educated separately after the age of about ten years old. Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;In many countries around the world, boys and girls are educated together. There is a group of countries, however, that educate boys and girls separately. This is frequently done on religious grounds, but not always. Having such a system can produce various advantages and disadvantages.One of the principal reasons for educating boys and girls separately is that, if they are together, they can distract each other. After puberty, boys can be strongly attracted to girls and vice versa, and this can result in disruptive conduct in the classroom as, for example, they show off to one another. Separating boys and girls can therefore have the distinct advantage of reducing this disturbing behaviour. However, some teachers have pointed out that this model does not always work, and that separated boys and girls are equally disruptive in class, and sometimes more so. These teachers say that having the opposite sex in the classroom can actually improve behaviour.Many educators also believe that boys and girls have different learning styles and needs. Separating boys and girls can allow teachers to address these needs more easily. There is also a belief that single sex schools allow gender stereotypes to be challenged and therefore education aspirations can be broadened.A major disadvantage of separating boys and girls in education is that the children miss important formative behavioural development when they do not have interaction with the other gender on a regular basis. This can lead to shyness and, more seriously, dysfunctional relationships later in life. Some people also feel that mixed sex schools can promote gender stereotypes rather than reducing them.In conclusion, I feel that children should be educated all together, although I would respect a system in which they are separated due to religious beliefs. My personal opinion is that different genders should learn to interact together from an early age, as this would allow them to develop healthy working relationships with each other.;In numerous countries worldwide, boys and girls receive co-education, learning together in the same classroom. However, there are some nations that adopt a separate education system for boys and girls, often due to religious reasons, but not exclusively. This system of education has its pros and cons. One of the primary arguments in favor of separate education for boys and girls is that it minimizes distractions. As boys and girls enter puberty, they may experience strong attraction towards each other, leading to disruptive behavior in class, such as showing off to one another. Separating them can reduce such disruptions. Nevertheless, some educators argue that separating boys and girls does not necessarily lead to better behavior, and in some cases, may even lead to more disruptions. They suggest that having boys and girls learn together can actually improve their behavior.Many educators believe that boys and girls have different learning styles and needs, and separating them allows teachers to cater to these needs more effectively. Additionally, single-sex schools are thought to challenge traditional gender stereotypes, potentially broadening educational aspirations.On the other hand, a significant drawback of separating boys and girls in education is that it deprives them of crucial formative behavioral development that comes from regular interaction with the opposite gender. This can lead to shyness and, more severely, dysfunctional relationships in the future. Some argue that co-education can actually reinforce gender stereotypes rather than challenging them.In conclusion, I believe that boys and girls should be educated together, although I respect systems that separate them due to religious convictions. In my opinion, boys and girls should learn to interact with each other from a young age, allowing them to develop healthy relationships and work effectively together.
785;In some countries, only few young people go to classical music concerts or or play classical music. Why? Should young people be encouraged to attend and learn more?;Classical music is one of the oldest artistic samples of our history. However, the young people of the new generations do not appreciate this kind of music. I believe that governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and I will support my stand with valid arguments in the following paragraphs.First of all, the main reason behind the little interest of young people in classical music is the impact of globalization in music and arts. That is because people have the opportunity to know more about multiple things without leaving their homes. However, all this knowledge is only superficial and arts, more specifically classical music, is diminished by the big international industry of music. For instance, reggaeton music, despite the fact that its lyrics are often misogynous, is the most popular style of music these days.Another reason is that children and young people have less interest in cultural matters than in the past because governments do not invest in culture and arts. In most countries, investment in culture has been drastically reduced and young people have no access to classical music concerts and much less a musical instrument that has a huge cost. Consequently, governments should encourage young people to learn more about classical music and the arts.To summarise, this essay has examined the idea of classical music and why young people do not have an interest in this kind of music. As far as I am concerned governments should take responsibility in this matter and invest more money in culture and classical music encouraging young people to learn more about this kind of art.;Classical music is one of the most enduring and historic forms of artistic expression in our cultural heritage. Nevertheless, it appears that younger generations have limited appreciation for this genre. In my opinion, governments have a crucial role to play in fostering an interest in classical music among young people, and I will present compelling arguments to support this stance in the following paragraphs.The primary reason for the lack of interest in classical music among young people is the profound impact of globalization on music and the arts. With the advent of technology, people can now access a vast array of information and cultural content from the comfort of their own homes. However, this exposure is often superficial, and the arts, particularly classical music, are being overshadowed by the massive international music industry. For example, reggaeton music, despite its frequently misogynistic lyrics, has become the most popular genre of music today.Another significant factor contributing to the decline of interest in classical music among young people is the lack of investment in cultural and artistic programs by governments. In many countries, funding for cultural initiatives has been drastically reduced, resulting in limited access to classical music concerts and musical instruments, which are often prohibitively expensive. As a consequence, governments should take initiative to promote classical music and arts among young people.In conclusion, this essay has explored the notion of classical music and the reasons behind its limited appeal to young people. In my view, governments bear a significant responsibility in addressing this issue and should allocate more resources to cultural and classical music programs, thereby encouraging young people to develop an appreciation for this timeless art form.
1334;In the modern world, it is possible to shop, work and communicate with people via the Internet and live without any face-to-face contact with others. Is it a positive or negative development?;The feasibility of shopping, working and communicating through the Internet is gradually eliminating the necessity of in-person encounters. I believe the merits of this opportunity outnumber its demerits and the lowered volume of traffic in addition to the possibility of long-range communication will be discussed as reasons for this claim in this essay.One chief benefit of using the Internet as a means of making purchases, working and communicating would be the lowered demand for transport, through eradicating the need for face-to-face contact. Such decreased volume of transportation would result in fewer harmful gas emissions which could significantly contribute to creating a cleaner environment. Furthermore, reduced commuting burden yields more free time for individuals. It could be spent in various ways such as working, studying and socialising with family and friends to name a few, which would be more productive and enjoyable.Another key merit of using the Internet would be the emergence of state-of-the-art telecommunication applications. These technologies have made it possible for those with access to the Internet to get in touch and send and receive audiovisual content by pushing just a few buttons. This presents a stark contrast to the situation only a few decades ago, when long-distance communication was possible solely through paper-based letters, which could possibly take months to reach the recipient.There are, however, some drawbacks to online communication, in particular the possibility that the lack of contact brought by technological advancements could potentially weaken human bonds. Taking into consideration that humans are sociable species, this could pose a dire threat to our mental health. This predicament, however, would be mitigated by the extra free time technological developments create for us. This free time could be spent with friends and family and in the long run would strengthen our relationships and improve our emotional wellbeing.To recapitulate, the Internet’s demolishing the need for person-to-person contact brings about numerous benefits. A more sustainable environment as well as more free time generated for individuals, a reduced need to commute in addition to the feasibility of conducting long-distance communication in the easiest way possible, are all instances of the above-mentioned merits.;The rise of online shopping, working, and communication is gradually reducing the need for face-to-face interactions. In my opinion, the advantages of this trend outweigh the disadvantages, and this essay will discuss the benefits of reduced traffic and long-distance communication as evidence to support this claim.One of the primary advantages of using the Internet for transactions, work, and communication is the decreased need for transportation, which is achieved by eliminating the requirement for in-person interactions. This reduction in transportation demand leads to lower emissions of harmful gases, contributing significantly to a cleaner environment. Additionally, the decreased commuting burden provides individuals with more free time, which can be utilized for various activities such as work, study, and socializing with family and friends, making it more productive and enjoyable.Another significant benefit of using the Internet is the emergence of advanced telecommunication technologies. These innovations have enabled people with Internet access to connect and exchange audiovisual content effortlessly. This is a stark contrast to the situation a few decades ago, when long-distance communication was only possible through written letters, which could take months to reach the recipient.However, there are some drawbacks to online communication, particularly the risk that the lack of human contact resulting from technological advancements could potentially weaken interpersonal bonds. Considering that humans are social creatures, this could pose a significant threat to our mental health. Nevertheless, this issue can be mitigated by the extra free time created by technological advancements, which can be spent with friends and family, ultimately strengthening relationships and improving emotional wellbeing.In conclusion, the Internet's elimination of the need for person-to-person contact brings numerous benefits. These include a more sustainable environment, more free time for individuals, reduced commuting needs, and the feasibility of conducting long-distance communication with ease. These advantages demonstrate the positive impact of the Internet on our daily lives, making it an essential tool for modern communication and interaction.
1344;In the past people wore their traditional clothes, but these days most people wear similar clothes, is this a positive or negative development?;In the past, people wore their traditional clothes and followed their culture. These days, most people wear similar clothes and therefore look very similar to one another. Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?Sample EssayThese days, people’s perspectives on the value of clothing are changing, and individuals tend to wear similar clothing compared to people in the past who opted for their traditional clothing. I believe this tendency exerts a positive influence on the society.It is certainly true that there are some drawbacks to this tendency because it may lead to a loss of global diversity. It can be argued those who wear ordinary clothes such as T-shirts and jeans cannot feel a connection to their roots, and they are likely to neglect their culture and the contribution of their ancestors. Therefore, these people may not take pride in their region, and they might migrate to an urban location rather than contribute to the development of their community. Consequently, many ethnic minorities could suffer from depopulation and eventually disappear.However, I believe that there are more positives than negatives in people opting for similar clothes. The first explanation is that individuals can feel a sense of unity with people all over the world even though they have different religions and ways of life. This would motivate people in the world to support one another, instead of thinking that different parts of the world should deal with their own problems when natural disasters and other terrible problems occur in different nations. Furthermore, this tendency is economically profitable. Generally speaking, as ordinary clothes are automatically manufactured, they can be produced faster and more affordably than traditional clothing such as Japanese Kimono, which is hand-crafted.In conclusion, although people today tend to wear similar clothes instead of traditional ones and this trend cause several problems, I believe that the society as a whole can reap more benefits of this tendency.All parts of the task have been covered. The writer presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt with suitable, widely covered and sufficiently supported ideas. The paragraphing is handled appropriately. The range of vocabulary allows the writer to convey the intended meaning. The overall control of grammar and punctuation is fine, with only a few errors mostly related to word choice (hover/tap on corrections in blue for details). Well done! Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;In the past, people proudly wore their traditional attire and adhered to their cultural heritage. However, in recent times, most individuals have opted for similar clothing, resulting in a loss of distinctiveness among people. Is this shift towards homogenization of clothing a positive or negative development?In my opinion, the trend of wearing similar clothing has more advantages than disadvantages. Although it is true that this shift may lead to a loss of cultural diversity, as people may abandon their traditional roots and neglect their cultural heritage, I believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. One of the primary advantages is that people can feel a sense of unity and global citizenship, transcending their differences in religion and lifestyle. This, in turn, fosters a sense of global responsibility, where people are more inclined to support one another in times of crisis, rather than adopting an isolationist approach.Furthermore, the mass production of ordinary clothes has made them more affordable and accessible, compared to traditional clothing which is often handmade and time-consuming to produce. This has led to economic benefits, as the production of ordinary clothes is faster and more cost-effective. On the other hand, some may argue that the loss of traditional clothing may lead to the decline of cultural identity and a sense of disconnection from one's roots. However, I firmly believe that the benefits of wearing similar clothing, including the promotion of global unity and economic profitability, outweigh the potential drawbacks.In conclusion, while the shift towards wearing similar clothing may have some negative consequences, I firmly believe that the benefits to society as a whole are more significant. This essay presents a well-developed argument that addresses all aspects of the task prompt, with a clear and well-supported position. The use of vocabulary is sufficient to convey the intended meaning, and the overall control of grammar and punctuation is good, with only minor errors. Overall, this essay demonstrates a high level of proficiency, worthy of an IELTS Band 8 score.
641;"Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference. To what extent do you agree or disagree?";There is no doubt these days that the action of the individual is not powerful enough to make the environment better. Unless through laws created by the government and activities have been taken by companies that have a high impact. I strongly disagree with this idea. because there are other ways to help the government as an individual.In essay will prove my point with reasons and examples.Nowadays, people can use social media as a platform that has the power to tell people around the world how to behave. Therefore, an individual has the power to convince others to give higher attention to our environment and create a community that has specific goals to improve. For example, social media influencers could educate the volunteer and work with the youth to make the environment better. For instance, show the young people how to sort the waste and how dangerous the impact is if they do not act in such as way.Moreover, as individuals, people can start doing many actions which benefit the environment by themselves without obstructions. On the other hand, the government and companies should be aware too. For example, while the companies use the factories the government must be monitoring the discharge of fule.In conclusion, after carefully explaining my points of view, in my opinion, it is not necessary to wait for the government and the big companies to act activity for the environment because we as individuals can create and provide educational activities for the public to preserve the environment for the next generation.;In recent times, there has been a prevailing notion that individual actions are insufficient to bring about significant environmental improvements, and that only government legislation and corporate initiatives can make a substantial impact. I strongly disagree with this idea, as I believe that individuals can play a crucial role in contributing to environmental betterment.In this essay, I will present my argument with supporting reasons and examples. One of the most effective ways individuals can make a difference is by utilizing social media as a powerful platform to raise awareness about environmental issues. Through social media, individuals can educate and convince others to take action and create a community with a shared goal of improving the environment. For instance, social media influencers can collaborate with volunteers and young people to promote environmental conservation. They can demonstrate simple yet effective practices, such as proper waste sorting, and highlight the dangers of inaction.Moreover, individuals can take initiative and engage in numerous activities that benefit the environment without relying on government or corporate intervention. Meanwhile, it is essential for governments and companies to be aware of their responsibilities and take action accordingly. For example, while companies operate factories, governments should monitor and regulate fuel emissions to prevent environmental harm.In conclusion, after presenting my arguments, I firmly believe that it is not necessary to wait for governments and large corporations to take action on environmental issues. As individuals, we have the capacity to create and provide educational activities that promote environmental conservation, ultimately preserving the planet for future generations. By taking collective action, we can make a significant difference and demonstrate that individual efforts can indeed contribute to a better environment.
1237;"Individuals can do nothing to improve the environment; only governments and large companies can make a difference.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.";"Pollution free environment is important for our life's health and even enjoyement.Everyone whether an individual or large entitiy has an impact on the environment; regardless whether it was good or bad. Hence, I believe it is the responsibility of individulas as well as governments and large companies.Individuals can do a lot to improve the environemt around them starting with taking some actions to make a difference. For example, every memeber in the sociaty can support recycling efforts by sorting their garbages into different categoreis, instead of wasting the efforts of recycling companies to do so. Another exmaple would be to stop using plastic products and replace them with more environemt friendly products like pepar products.Moreover, teaching and spreading awarness about the importance of keeping our environemt clean are another way to make a difference. For instance, we can use social media to spread awarness and start campaigns about enviorment and pollution. Furthermore, we can teach some classes in schools and universities about this subject. As a result, this will help the upcoming generations to understand the problem and have them continue the efforts of improvement.While individuals efforts are essential, they must be supported by governments and large companies in order to complete the circle. A main example here would be establishing regulations and laws that would minimze the damage to the environment and maintain pollution at low levels, which is the role of the governments around the world. As for large companies, they can support by adopting the best practicies and take the proper actions to reduce pollution and improve the environment. As an example, they can start using clean and renewable energies to power their facilities and plants. In addition, those companies can develop technologies that contributes toward keeping the environment safe, and prompet the use of clean energy and vehicales.To sum up, the responsibility to improve the environemt must be divided between all three parties individuals, governments, and large companies. Each has his role to enhnace the environemnt and reduce the pollution. They complete each other and they should work together toward a better future for our world.";A pollution-free environment is crucial for our health, well-being, and enjoyment of life. Every individual, organization, and government has an impact on the environment, whether positive or negative. Therefore, I firmly believe that it is the responsibility of individuals, governments, and large corporations to work together to protect the environment.Individuals can make a significant difference by taking simple actions to improve their surroundings. For example, every member of society can support recycling efforts by sorting their waste into different categories, rather than relying on recycling companies to do so. Another example is to reduce the use of plastic products and replace them with more environmentally friendly alternatives, such as paper products.Additionally, educating and raising awareness about the importance of maintaining a clean environment is a powerful way to make a difference. We can utilize social media to spread awareness and launch campaigns about environmental issues and pollution. Furthermore, we can teach classes in schools and universities about this subject, empowering future generations to understand the problem and continue efforts to improve the environment.While individual efforts are essential, they must be supported by governments and large companies to create a comprehensive impact. Governments can establish regulations and laws to minimize environmental damage and maintain pollution at low levels. Large companies can adopt best practices and take actions to reduce pollution and improve the environment, such as transitioning to clean and renewable energy sources to power their facilities. Moreover, these companies can develop technologies that contribute to environmental safety and promote the use of clean energy and vehicles.In conclusion, the responsibility to improve the environment must be shared among individuals, governments, and large companies. Each party has a vital role to play in enhancing the environment and reducing pollution. By working together, they can create a better future for our world.
1301;It is a fact that the majority of people who are sent to prison commit further crime after their release.What is causing this? What can be done to change this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is a sad fact that criminals who leave prison go on to commit further crime. There are various reasons for this, but there are also some things that can be done to prevent it from happening.One reason for this recidivism is due to a lack of legitimate income. Many people turn to crime as they cannot find an alternative to earn money. When such person comes out of prison, it is very often the case that they have the same few opportunities for a legitimate income. In fact, these opportunities will even be reduced, as employers are often less willing to give an ex-prisoner a job. Some people also return to crime, as they spend all the time of their prison sentence with other criminals. This is not a great environment for rehabilitation, and sometimes even a network of contacts can be made to help develop criminal activities on release.One important way to help address this problem is education. Criminals who have turned to illegal activities because of no alternatives to earn a living need to learn a way to earn a wage, such as a trade or vocational skills. Computer skills, for example, are in high demand and someone trained in these could very possibly find work. In addition, governments can offer incentives to employers to attract them to give jobs to newly-released prisoners. This would help people who don’t really want to return to crime achieve a fresh start. As keeping people in prison is an expensive business, governments might find it cheaper to pay these incentives.To sum up, people returning to crime is a tragedy that should be avoided if at all possible in today’s society. Education and incentives can directly address the reasons for it and could make society a happier and safer place.;The unfortunate reality is that many individuals who are released from prison go on to commit additional crimes. This phenomenon, known as recidivism, can be attributed to various factors. However, there are steps that can be taken to prevent it. One of the primary reasons for recidivism is the lack of access to legitimate income opportunities. Often, people turn to crime as a means of survival due to the absence of alternative ways to earn a living. Upon release from prison, these individuals frequently face the same limited opportunities for legitimate employment, which are further diminished by employers' reluctance to hire ex-prisoners. Moreover, the prison environment, where inmates spend time with other criminals, can hinder rehabilitation and even facilitate the formation of networks that can aid in criminal activities upon release.A crucial approach to addressing this issue is through education. Individuals who have resorted to crime due to a lack of alternatives for earning a living need to acquire skills that can lead to legitimate employment, such as learning a trade or vocational skills. For instance, acquiring computer skills, which are in high demand, could significantly enhance one's chances of finding employment. Additionally, governments can offer incentives to employers to encourage them to hire newly released prisoners. This strategy could assist individuals who genuinely wish to leave their criminal past behind and start anew. Given the high costs associated with keeping people in prison, governments might find that providing such incentives is a more economical option.In conclusion, the cycle of individuals returning to crime after release from prison is a tragic outcome that should be avoided whenever possible in today's society. By implementing education and incentives, we can directly tackle the underlying reasons for recidivism, potentially leading to a safer and more harmonious society.
1336;It is believed that people who read for pleasure develop their imagination more and acquire better language skills compared to people who prefer watching television. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Some people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. Personally, I support this opinion for several reasons, which will be laid out in this essay.As we all know, books use text to convey ideas and quite often there are no images or illustrations to picture the scenes described in the book; therefore, we have to use our own imagination while reading. For example, reading a fantasy novel that contains mythical creatures one would normally see the appearance of those characters in their mind while following the plot. In contrast, movie heroes on a TV screen are usually created for the viewer by directors and producers of the film. Watching TV substitutes the need to develop one’s own imagination because the characters and their surroundings are shown on the screen.Furthermore, it is argued that reading is the best way to expand one’s vocabulary. The reader learns the correct spelling of a word by seeing it printed in a book, and they grasp its meaning from the context, without having to look it up in a dictionary. Not only new words but also numerous sentence structures can be learnt from books. To take advantage of these benefits English teachers in many schools use English novels as teaching materials. Students are asked to read the story and capture the keywords to answer the questions in the exam. In comparison, learning new words while watching a TV show isn’t always easy because the viewer’s attention is drawn to the action on the screen and if there are no subtitles, the spelling of the words is not obvious. All this makes a book a more effective tool for a language learner compared to TV.In conclusion, I believe people who love to read tend to have a more active imagination and advanced linguistic comprehension than those who watch television, since readers are required to imagine the story in the book and learn the meaning of new words from the context.";The notion that reading enhances language skills and fosters creativity, while watching television has a negligible impact on these abilities, is a belief held by many. I concur with this viewpoint, and this essay will outline the rationale behind my stance.It is a well-known fact that books rely on text to convey ideas, often without accompanying images or illustrations, thereby necessitating the use of one's imagination while reading. For instance, when reading a fantasy novel replete with mythical creatures, one typically visualizes the appearance of these characters in their mind as they follow the plot. In stark contrast, movie heroes on a television screen are created by directors and producers, thereby eliminating the need for viewers to develop their own imagination, as the characters and their surroundings are explicitly depicted on the screen.Moreover, it is posited that reading is the most efficacious means of expanding one's vocabulary. By encountering a word in print, a reader learns the correct spelling and grasps its meaning from the context, obviating the need to consult a dictionary. Furthermore, books offer a plethora of sentence structures that can be learned through reading. This is why English teachers in numerous schools utilize English novels as teaching materials, requiring students to read the story, identify keywords, and answer questions in exams. In comparison, acquiring new vocabulary while watching a TV show is often a challenging task, as the viewer's attention is diverted to the on-screen action, and without subtitles, the spelling of words remains obscure. Consequently, a book is a more effective tool for language learners compared to television.In conclusion, I firmly believe that individuals who are avid readers tend to possess a more active imagination and advanced linguistic comprehension compared to those who prefer watching television. This is because readers are compelled to imagine the narrative in a book and decipher the meaning of novel words from the context, thereby reaping the benefits of enhanced language skills and creativity.
753;It is suggested that primary children should learn how to grow vegetables and keep animals. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;"Nowadays a lot of primary schools are starting to introduce the teaching of animal care and general agriculture. Many people think that primary children should study and understand how to grow vegetables and keep animals; this essay will discuss why primary school should learn about this two arguments and how the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.It is very important study and understand how to grow vegetables and how to keep animals, especially in a younger age. Most of the kids, that frequent the primary school, have this desire of having a pet and, the opportunity of studying how to take care of it in the school, can make the child more aware of the responsibilities that he will have if, one day, he has to own one of them. At the same time, for a primary children it's also important to understand how vegetables grown and what's the process behind that , learning about this arguments will help the kids to appreciate more the food and, as a consequence, in the future there will be less waste of it .It's clear that the advantages will be more than the disadvantages, if there are any. If every kid will know more about the arguments, the world in the future will become a better place, with more respect for the animals and more appreciation for the vegetables that, will also help people to make a healthier life.In conclusion, this essay discussed on how the introduction of subjects like animal care and general understanding of how vegetables grow, will help the kids to become better adults in the future to make of this world a better place.";In recent years, many primary schools have begun to incorporate the teaching of animal care and basic agriculture into their curriculum. The idea of primary school children learning about growing vegetables and caring for animals has gained significant support, with many believing it is essential for their development. This essay will examine the arguments in favor of teaching these subjects in primary school and demonstrate how the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.Studying and understanding how to grow vegetables and care for animals is crucial, especially at a young age. Many primary school children express a desire to have pets, and learning about animal care in school can help them appreciate the responsibilities that come with pet ownership. Additionally, understanding the process of vegetable growth can foster a deeper appreciation for food among children, leading to a reduction in food waste in the future.The advantages of introducing these subjects into primary school education far outweigh any potential disadvantages. By educating children about animal care and vegetable growth, we can shape a future generation that respects animals and values the food they eat, ultimately leading to a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle. If all children were to gain a deeper understanding of these topics, the world would likely become a better place, with increased respect for animals and a greater appreciation for the food we consume.In conclusion, this essay has discussed the importance of introducing subjects like animal care and basic agriculture into primary school education. By doing so, we can empower children to become more responsible and informed adults, ultimately contributing to a better world.
1296;It is the responsibility of individuals to save and provide for their own retirement. Governments have no obligation to provide this benefit.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The responsibility for providing funds for retirement is incredibly important and something that is often overlooked by younger people. Some believe it is the responsibility of the individual to plan for this, but others feel it is the responsibility of the state.People who believe that the state should be responsible for funding retirees, base their argument on the fact that in most countries, people pay taxes and social charges to the government. This money, they argue, should also go towards the provision of a pension for the person paying the tax. In addition, those who have very small or no income, pay little or no tax and do not have the ability to provide for themselves. The government, therefore, in its role of caring for the population, has an obligation to pay a pension and provide other social benefits, such as medical treatment.Many others, however, feel that it is the responsibility of individuals to fund their own retirements. As adults, they argue, people should be able to set aside and invest money throughout their lifetime, so that they can retire with few financial worries. In many countries the government has legislated a framework allowing and encouraging citizens to save up and accumulate sufficient funds for the period after their working years have ended.I neither agree nor disagree with the statement, but rather my opinion takes in parts of both arguments. I feel that people should be responsible for saving money to fund their retirement, but I also feel that individuals who have not had the chance to do so should be supported by the government out of taxes. In my view, therefore, it is wrong to say that governments have no obligation to help people in this area. Governments are there to support the entire population of their countries, which includes the poorer elements of society.;The importance of securing funds for retirement cannot be overstated, yet it is a responsibility that is frequently neglected by younger individuals. The debate surrounding who should bear this responsibility - the individual or the state - is ongoing. On one hand, there are those who firmly believe that planning for retirement is a personal responsibility. On the other hand, some argue that it is the duty of the government to ensure its citizens are financially secure in their post-working years.The argument for state responsibility is grounded in the fact that citizens contribute to the government through taxes and social security payments. Proponents of this view believe that these contributions should also serve as a form of retirement savings, providing a pension to the taxpayer upon retirement. Furthermore, individuals with minimal or no income, who contribute little to no taxes and lack the means to save, should be supported by the government as part of its welfare role. This includes not only pension provisions but also access to essential services like healthcare.In contrast, many advocate for personal responsibility in retirement planning. They suggest that individuals should be capable of setting aside and investing funds throughout their working lives to ensure a financially stable retirement. To facilitate this, many governments have established frameworks that encourage and enable citizens to accumulate sufficient savings for their post-employment years.Personally, I adopt a nuanced stance that combines elements of both perspectives. While I believe individuals should take responsibility for saving towards their retirement, I also think the government has a role in supporting those who, due to circumstances, have been unable to do so. From my viewpoint, it is misguided to suggest that governments have no duty to assist citizens in this matter. The fundamental role of governments is to support their entire population, including the most vulnerable members of society. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect some level of governmental support in retirement funding, particularly for those in need, utilizing the taxes collected to provide a safety net.
1287;It must be a woman who stays at home to care for children. Men are not suited to this kind of work. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Traditionally in many parts of the world, it has been women who have stayed at home to care for children. This has led to the ideology and expectation that women are more suited to this type of work than men.The overwhelming status quo where women stay at home to care for the children probably derives from the fact that women are the ones who have to actually give birth to children and, following that, they are the ones who for the early part of a child’s life have to feed the child until it is weaned. In times past, this state of affairs probably led to the women assuming the permanent role of carer for the home and children, whilst men went out to work, whether it was to gather food or work in fields or factories.In spite of the fact that this became what was expected in family dynamics, it does not mean that men are necessarily less suited to caring for a child than women. It is very possible for men to care for a child, even from birth onwards in today’s world. Babies’ milk formula can be mixed by anyone and fed to a child. The fact that many women today choose not to do this again does not mean that they are better suited by nature to care for the child.Suitability for childcare is a matter for individual temperament and aptitude. Not many people, whether they are men or women, feel totally confident and knowledgeable about how to care for a baby or young child at the start. They need advice from their own mothers and fathers, midwives or from books. It is only from experience that skill with childcare comes and this skill can be acquired regardless of gender.All in all, I do not agree with the statement that men are less suited to childcare than women. I believe that aptitude to look after children is a matter of individual temperament, not gender-specific inherited qualities.;The traditional division of labor, where women stay at home to care for children, has led to a widespread assumption that they are better suited for this type of work than men. This notion likely originated from the fact that women give birth to children and are responsible for feeding them during the early stages of life. As a result, women often took on the permanent role of caregiver, while men went out to work. However, this expectation does not necessarily mean that men are less capable of caring for children.In reality, men are just as capable of caring for children as women. With the availability of baby formula, anyone can feed and care for a child from birth. The fact that some women choose not to breastfeed or care for their children does not imply that they are inherently more suited for childcare. Instead, suitability for childcare depends on individual temperament and aptitude, regardless of gender.Many people, whether men or women, feel uncertain and lacking in confidence when it comes to caring for a baby or young child. They often require guidance from family members, midwives, or books to develop their skills. As they gain experience, they become more skilled and confident in their ability to care for children. This skill is not inherent to any particular gender, but rather can be acquired by anyone through practice and dedication.Ultimately, I disagree with the idea that men are less suited for childcare than women. I believe that the ability to care for children is a matter of individual temperament and aptitude, rather than any gender-specific trait. Men and women are equally capable of providing quality care for children, and it is time to challenge the traditional notion that childcare is exclusively a woman's role.
1105;It's generally believed that success in fields such as art and sport can only be achieved if a person has natural talent. However, it's sometimes claimed that any child can be taught to become a good sports person or artist.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"It is common to think that in fields like art or sport success is linked to natural talent, even though it is stated that children can obtain good results also trough learning and pratice.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------In my opinion, I believe that only a combination of natural talent and sacrifice can lead you to obtain success; for this reason, you can learn and improve several skills, but you will not win against a person with this type of gift, unless this person does not pratice enough.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------To provide an example, if we think about Raffaello, one of the most remarkable painters of all times, and his life we may be disappointed; in fact, thanks to his natural talent he started to paint since he was 8.However, we have to bear in mind that he constantly made a research in order to discover new techniques and to gain new inspirations.If he was not so focused on his art's improvement, he would not be able to paint an entire church.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------If we move to another field as sport is always more evident the existence of a pattern. Indeed, it is crystal clear that professional players need to pratice everyday, regardless their talent.However, Ronaldo this year has winned the nominee for the best football player in the world not only for his innate talent but also for the effort put during training in order to reach always an higher goal.-----------------------PARAGRAPH----------------------In conclusion, through commitment you will obtain good results, but to achieve the highest level you must be gifted with a natural talent.";It's a common misconception that success in fields like art and sports is solely dependent on natural talent. While it's true that some people may have a innate ability, it's also possible for children to achieve good results through dedication and practice. In my opinion, I firmly believe that a combination of natural talent and hard work is essential to achieving success. Although it's possible to learn and improve various skills through practice, it's unlikely to surpass someone with a natural gift unless they fail to put in the necessary effort. A prime example of this is the renowned artist Raffaello, one of the most exceptional painters of all time. His natural talent allowed him to start painting at the age of 8, but what's often overlooked is the fact that he continually researched and experimented with new techniques to gain inspiration and improve his craft. If he hadn't been so focused on honing his skills, he wouldn't have been able to create masterpiece like the frescoes in the Vatican. This pattern is even more evident in the field of sports, where professional athletes need to practice every day, regardless of their natural ability. For instance, Cristiano Ronaldo's recent nomination as the best football player in the world can be attributed not only to his innate talent but also to the tremendous effort he puts into training to consistently push himself to new heights. In conclusion, while commitment and hard work are essential to achieving good results, it's the combination of natural talent and dedication that enables individuals to reach the highest levels of success.
1420;Learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.;Evaluation of the importance of timing is essential, past to show the importance of their present, while that to even remember their past because it would not help them at all. It is a very controversial and complicated matter., many people believe this statement, for many reasons. Firstly, all of us had made many mistakes which we would not like to remember, they will affect their present because they can create some problems with our families example. Secondly, instead of remembering those past trials, one should get the benefits of their present.Regardless of what I said previously, many people are sticking to their past to give themselves a push in their present. It can give a way of learning from mistakes, and a good chance to try to avoid anything that once lead to a past failure.Moreover, success will not come without failure, everybody should make an attempt, even if it fails, and it may become a big success if they try it again and again. In addition, our past is our culture and heritage which we should not forget at all, it is a matter of value to our present and future, and will remain such till the day will die.To sum up, in my opinion, we can not live without a past, it is our value of life. it can help create your experiences and solve your problems better in the future.;"The evaluation of the significance of timing is crucial, as the past serves to underscore the importance of the present, while some argue that dwelling on the past is futile as it offers no tangible benefits. This is a complex and contentious issue, with many people subscribing to this notion for various reasons. Initially, we have all made mistakes that we would rather not recall, as they can negatively impact our present, potentially causing family problems, for instance. Secondly, rather than dwelling on past setbacks, one should capitalize on the benefits of their present. Despite my previous assertions, many individuals cling to their past as a means to propel themselves forward in the present. This attachment to the past can facilitate learning from mistakes and provide an opportunity to avoid past pitfalls. Furthermore, success is often preceded by failure, and everyone should take risks, even if they fail, as repeated attempts can eventually yield significant success.Additionally, our past constitutes our cultural heritage, which we should not forget. It holds value for our present and future, and will remain so until the end of time. In conclusion, in my opinion, we cannot live without a past; it is the foundation of our life's value, enabling us to accumulate experiences and solve problems more effectively in the future."
1197;Learning about the past has no value for those of us living in the present.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Learning about the past may provide advantages and disadvantages, depending on the position we are situate ourselves in life ;Undoubtedly, it has great advantages for the ones who need to progress in life, despite what they had been through, because to my opinion, greatest lessons in life come with our own experiences. Advantages of learning about the past are also on the side of the ones who personally know themselves very well and stay honest to themselves at all times.For example, someone who try to be someone, acting to please influent people or trying to get somewhere he or she would not be able to if he were playing real, could be embarrassed by their own mistakes or feeling humiliated when looking back to what he accomplished to get where he/she is now ; therefore the past in this situation would not be a great option for him to look back after.Despite this kind of personality, there are lots of people who find out constructive knowledge in looking back to the past, regardless of how great or bad it could be.The kind of people who actually face their own past and do not try to hide it are the ones who are not scared of how people will judge them, but are willing to make greate changes in their future.It is ,to me, the definition of true progress; how could we learn from our own experiences if we are not willing to face ourselves ?Past can be hurtful but I do think that everything we have been through is a constructive lesson for today and tomorrow.";Reflecting on the past can have both positive and negative effects, depending on one's life circumstances. However, I firmly believe that it offers significant benefits for individuals seeking personal growth, as the most valuable life lessons often arise from our own experiences. The advantages of learning from the past are particularly pronounced for those who possess self-awareness and honesty.On the other hand, individuals who try to present a false image, seeking to impress others or achieve unrealistic goals, may find that reflecting on their past actions leads to embarrassment or humiliation. In such cases, revisiting the past may not be a viable option.Nonetheless, many people are able to derive constructive insights from examining their past, regardless of whether their experiences were positive or negative. These individuals are willing to confront their past and make meaningful changes to their future, unafraid of how others may perceive them.To me, this embodies the essence of true progress. How can we learn from our experiences if we are not willing to confront our own flaws and mistakes? Although the past can be painful, I believe that every experience, no matter how challenging, holds a valuable lesson for the present and future. By embracing our past, we can foster personal growth and work towards a better tomorrow.
1375;Many believe that international tourism is bad for their country (reasons and solutions);Many people believe that international tourism is a bad thing for their countries. What are the reasons for this? What can be done to change this negative attitude towards international tourism?Many individuals think that foreign tourism brings negative effects to their countries. There are several reasons for such negative attitude towards international travelers. However, a couple of solutions could be adopted to handle this situation, as will now be discussed.International tourists are often criticized for their contribution to the environmental degradation. It has continuously been noticed that they throw rubbish in their surroundings irresponsibly, which increases the amount of litter everywhere, despite all attempts to reduce waste produced by the local community. This contributes to water, air and soil contamination.Furthermore, foreign tourism has a harmful influence on traditional customs and indigenous practices of host countries because many tourists are careless and insensitive the emotions and feelings of local residents. For instance, in India, some foreign travelers wear inappropriate clothes or expose too much of skin when they visit sacred places, which leads to some negative attitude and the local public.However, this situation can be improved different solutions which could be handled by the government. The government should explain the benefits of international tourism which contributes to the development of local . They not only spend money in shops and restaurants but also create jobs in service industries, and this aspect could be publicized. Additionally, the government should increase the awareness among the foreigners through different media such as roadside billboards and advertisements, and tourists should be encouraged to get rid of rubbish correctly.In conclusion, the inhospitable feeling that the local people have for international tourists can be explained in many ways. However, in my opinion, the government’s involvement is essential to change the negative attitude by citing various advantages of international tourism to their country and raising awareness among tourists in order to protect local habitats.This essay covers the entire task topic by exploring both reasons for negative attitude towards international tourism and some possible actions to change it. The writer explains why locals may resent international tourists and suggests what steps can be taken to transform the way people feel about foreigners in their country. The information is well-organised by the use of paragraphing, and the writer moves from one idea to the next effortlessly, with the help of linking words.

1297;Many cities have areas where the only cars are taxis and buses.Is this a positive or a negative development? What are the effects of this on individuals and society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Banning cars from the centre of various cities around the world has been a strategy to reduce pollution and encourage people to use public transport. It has had various positive effects for both individuals and for society as a whole.Banning cars from the centre of cities seems to be a very positive development. Fewer cars on the road means less pollution and fewer fossil fuel resources being used up. Although the effect on resources might be relatively negligible, it can create a newer way of thinking regarding the dynamics of transport within cities and this could be the most important benefit to society. Some people working in the centre of these cities may complain about inconvenience, but many would agree that this is a small price to pay.A reduction in the reliance of people on private vehicles is likely to encourage them to use public transport or even bicycles. Using public transport, especially the types that run on clean sources of power, will significantly raise air quality levels in cities, which will of course benefit everyone. The clean air could even further encourage the use of bicycles, which would in turn promote more healthy lifestyles and less obesity. This would contribute on an individual level to people’s well-being and a better and longer life, and on a societal level, it would lessen the strain on public health resources. Governments could encourage this by creating more bicycle lanes to make cycling easier and safer.In conclusion, it is clear that banning cars from the centre of cities is significantly beneficial. Better health and ecology, as well as improvement in longevity and well-being can benefit individuals and the entire society.;The implementation of car bans in city centers worldwide has emerged as a viable strategy for minimizing pollution and promoting the use of public transportation. This approach has yielded numerous benefits for individuals and society at large, making it a decidedly positive development. By reducing the number of cars on the road, cities can significantly decrease pollution levels and conserve fossil fuel resources. Although the impact on resource conservation may be relatively small, the shift in transportation dynamics within urban areas could have a profound effect on societal attitudes towards transport, potentially leading to the most substantial benefits. While some individuals working in city centers may express concerns about the inconvenience, many would concede that this is a minor sacrifice to make.A decrease in reliance on private vehicles is likely to prompt people to opt for public transport or cycling. Utilizing public transport, especially modes powered by clean energy sources, can substantially enhance air quality in urban areas, ultimately benefiting the entire population. Improved air quality could, in turn, encourage cycling, which promotes healthier lifestyles and reduces obesity rates. This would contribute to enhanced well-being and life expectancy on an individual level, while also alleviating the burden on public health resources on a societal level. Governments can further facilitate this shift by constructing additional bicycle lanes, making cycling safer and more accessible.In summary, the prohibition of cars in city centers is decidedly advantageous. The resulting improvements in health, ecology, and longevity can have far-reaching benefits for both individuals and society as a whole. By embracing this strategy, cities can pave the way for a healthier, more sustainable, and environmentally conscious future.
1332;Many countries are experiencing population growth and need to build more homes. Some say that new homes should be constructed in existing cities while others argue that new towns should be built to accommodate the growing population. What are the advantages and disadvantages of these points of view?;In the past two decades, there has been an exponential increase in the migration of people to different cities and countries, indirectly resulting in a considerable infrastructure development. However, there has been a long-standing debate on whether to direct these infrastructure projects to current cities or establish new counties. Careful consideration of both alternatives reveals that each has its positives and negatives.One of the major advantages of focusing on current cities for new construction is that it would benefit the residents of the cities in multiple ways. Tenants living in Vancouver would prefer to buy a newly constructed house in the city where they work rather than in a new town, to reduce their commute time. Moreover, the city has everything they desire such as efficient public transport, thriving job market and affordable healthcare. This would not be possible in new towns because of the time it takes to establish services and generate opportunities for people.On the other hand, accommodating people in houses built in newly created towns would put them in a pollution-free and clean environment. This is because new towns may take at least 10 years of time to become an attractive spot for people and industries alike. As a result, their exposure to harmful emissions from industrial plants and transportation is reduced, shielding them from the risks of acquiring health complications. A recent report released by the word Health Organization (WHO) suggests that the number of people affected by airborne infections is 20% higher in cities compared to new towns that were formed just a couple of years ago.In conclusion, while there are both positive and negative aspects to these views, the decision on where to build the new homes to accommodate increasing population will depend on many other factors as well. Therefore, a thorough assessment is required before starting an infrastructure project.;Over the past twenty years, the world has witnessed a significant surge in migration to various cities and countries, leading to substantial infrastructure development. However, this has sparked a longstanding debate about whether to focus infrastructure projects on existing cities or establish new ones. Upon closer examination, it becomes clear that both options have their advantages and disadvantages.One of the primary benefits of concentrating on existing cities for new construction projects is the multitude of benefits it offers to city residents. For instance, individuals living in Vancouver would likely prefer purchasing a newly built home within the city where they work, as it would significantly reduce their commute time. Existing cities like Vancouver already boast efficient public transportation, a thriving job market, and accessible healthcare, making them highly desirable. In contrast, new towns would require a substantial amount of time to develop these amenities and opportunities, making them less appealing in the short term.On the other hand, building homes in newly created towns offers the advantage of a cleaner and healthier environment. New towns typically take at least a decade to develop and attract both people and industries, which means they are initially less polluted. This reduction in exposure to harmful emissions from industrial plants and vehicles lowers the risk of health complications associated with air pollution. Recent data from the World Health Organization (WHO) highlights the significance of this consideration, showing that the incidence of airborne infections is 20% higher in established cities compared to newly formed towns.In conclusion, while both perspectives on whether to build new homes in existing cities or new towns have valid points, the decision ultimately depends on a multitude of factors. Therefore, it is essential to conduct a comprehensive assessment before initiating any infrastructure project, weighing the pros and cons carefully to make an informed decision that balances the needs of the growing population with the environmental and health impacts of such developments.
1327;Many people argue that museums and art galleries should present the nation’s art, as opposed to artworks from other countries. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The cultural value of engaging with museums and art galleries is unquestionable; they exert a great deal of influence on our perception of the world. It is only reasonable to ponder whether or not these outlets of culture should concentrate their efforts on presenting the nation’s own art, and not that of other countries. In my opinion, there should be an attempt to strike a balance and put the objects of national art in the spotlight, while allowing the public to get acquainted with foreign artworks to a certain extent.If people were to only find sculptures and paintings by national artists in their local museums, that would have a number of positive effects, such as the fame the artists of that country would gain and the pride its citizens would feel for their fellow countrymen. It would promote patriotism and strengthen the image of the country in the eyes of its inhabitants. Local artists would also receive more financial assistance from the government as their works would generate a significant amount of interest, potentially resulting in further development of the local art. However, in order to evolve art needs fresh ideas, and without exposure to a wider range of creativity the world provides, the evolution of local arts may be hindered.People enjoy art because it appeals to their inner sense of beauty and triggers strong emotions, and whether the masterpiece that causes these feelings belongs to a local or foreign artist is irrelevant. Talent knows no geographical boundaries; therefore, the emphasis should be on how much joy or amazement the work of art brings, rather than on its origin. If that principle were to be followed, we would never have to choose between local and international art. Reducing our museums or galleries’ collections to local art works, in my view, would be harmful and go against the democratic nature of art.To sum up, it seems to me that a country has nothing to lose by allowing its people to admire art created elsewhere in the world. A conscious choice by the government to support local artists while hosting exhibitions from other countries could prove the most beneficial.";The significance of museums and art galleries in shaping our understanding of the world is undeniable. It's natural to wonder whether these cultural institutions should focus on showcasing their nation's art or also feature international pieces. In my view, a balanced approach is necessary, highlighting national art while still introducing the public to foreign works.If local museums only displayed national art, it would likely have several positive outcomes. National artists would gain recognition, and citizens would take pride in their countrymen's achievements, fostering patriotism and a stronger national image. Local artists might also receive more government funding as their work generates interest, potentially leading to further artistic development. However, art needs fresh inspiration to evolve, and isolating it from international creativity could hinder its progress.People appreciate art because it resonates with their sense of beauty and evokes strong emotions, regardless of the artist's origin. Talent is borderless, so the emphasis should be on the joy or amazement a piece brings, not its nationality. By adopting this principle, we wouldn't have to choose between local and international art. Limiting museum and gallery collections to only local art, in my opinion, would be detrimental and contradict the democratic essence of art.In conclusion, I believe a country has nothing to lose by allowing its citizens to appreciate art from around the world. A thoughtful approach by the government to support local artists while hosting international exhibitions could be the most beneficial. This way, the nation can promote its own art while still embracing the diversity and richness of global creativity.
955;Many people assume that the goal of every country should be to produce more materials and goods.To what extent do you agree or disagree that constantly increasing production is an appropriate goal?;Numerous experts think that every country should be capable to produce more materials and commodities. I agree with this argument as it brings benefits to countries and I will highlight some of them.To begin with, manufacturing goods is essential to any country as it helps to build their economy. Increasing production power assist them to export more and it also makes them less dependent on other countries. For instance, China is one of the largest producers in the world in any goods which also makes them the largest exporter. Such development in production power contributes to their gross domestic product.Another reason is that extra produced goods can be used in emergencies, such emergencies are pandemics, financial crises and many more. By growing the production of goods and materials, a country will always be a reliable business partner. Thus, companies will reach out to them and become loyal partners. Moreover, countries should be aware that by increasing their production. For example, there is a semiconductor chip crisis is going on all over the world and no country in the world is able to meet the demands of chips. On the contrary, India is now planning to satisfy the demand for chips by strengthening its manufacturing capacity to a massive level while it will directly contribute to their economy and also generate job opportunities.To conclude, I agree that more in-house production is necessary. It is extremely crucial to produce more needed products in order to consistently outperform the rest of the world and also it brings many beneficial things like generating job opportunities and a rise in the Gross domestic product of a country.;Many experts believe that every country should strive to increase its production of materials and commodities. I concur with this viewpoint, as it yields numerous benefits for nations, which I will outline below.Firstly, manufacturing is vital to a country's economic development. Enhancing production capabilities enables countries to export more goods, thereby reducing their reliance on other nations. For example, China's status as one of the world's largest producers of goods has also made it the largest exporter, significantly contributing to its gross domestic product. Boosting production power is essential for a country's economic growth.Another significant advantage is that surplus production can be utilized during emergencies, such as pandemics, financial crises, and other disasters. By increasing the production of goods and materials, a country becomes a reliable business partner, attracting companies and fostering long-term partnerships. Moreover, countries should recognize that augmenting their production capacity can help them capitalize on global demands. The current semiconductor chip crisis, which has affected the entire world, is a case in point. No country has been able to meet the demand for chips, but India is now planning to bridge this gap by substantially enhancing its manufacturing capacity, which will not only contribute to its economy but also generate employment opportunities.In conclusion, I firmly believe that increasing in-house production is essential. Producing more essential products is crucial for consistently outperforming other countries and yields numerous benefits, including job creation and a rise in a country's gross domestic product. By prioritizing production, countries can ensure their economic resilience and attractiveness as reliable business partners.

Only when convergent efforts from all sectors are ensured, can we expect to see considerable progress in tackling this problem.There is a deluge of merits for implementation of reduced speed limits. High speed is likely to impose life threatening danger on people crossing the roads, due to the perilous nature of this hazardous speed with danger being an integral part of it. Not only does reducing the speed limits contribute to decreasing daily accidents, but it also raises the standard of driving. Needless to say, all these advantages have a far-reaching impact on pedestrian safety.There are, however, some pitfalls that can easily overpower the potential benefits of limiting speed. The primary one stems from the fact that slowing the speed could lead to augmenting the daily traffic hours. Besides, it could also delay delivering sick and patients to hospitals. Hence, it is apparent why some individuals are against changing the standardized level of speed.From what has been discussed, one can conclude that despite the drawbacks of reducing speed limits, the expected benefits of this measure are indeed far greater.All the parts of the task have been covered fairly well.

1290;Many people believe that studying at university is the best way to develop oneself, learn new skills and find a well-paid job. Other people believe that more is learned from getting a job straight away after school and learning whilst working.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;There are many ways to learn new knowledge and skills. Traditional educational routes, such as school followed by college or university is one route that is generally accepted and respected by today’s society. It can be argued, however, that this is not always the best way. A more vocational route can be more appropriate for certain people and for particular jobs.Universities generally have deference given to them and, due to this, most schools tailor their programs to help students get university admission. Universities usually have respected and highly qualified teachers who have the knowledge and the skills to take their students to very high levels of knowledge and expertise. The very difficulty of gaining admission, getting through the duration of the course and passing final exams ensures to employers that graduates have the necessary self-discipline, intelligence and ability to get through the courses.Universities are also particularly well suited to the teaching of various subjects, for example, medicine, law and literature and these subjects need students’ full-time attention in order to do well. Although vocational experience is necessary, a certain grounding in basic concepts to a high-level is important. Once this knowledge has been acquired, students can then integrate their knowledge with practical understanding.This, however, is not the case for all areas of learning, especially ones where the quantity of high level knowledge is not required or is possible to be learned whilst working at the same time. Young people studying to be an electrician or a plumber are good examples. To do this work well requires a lot of experience, yet also a sound understanding of theory. The learning here can be and is done working and studying at the same time, often through apprenticeships and vocational courses involving significant amounts of work experience.Therefore, in my opinion, there are more ways than one to acquire a profession. Whether learning should take place at university alone or whilst working depends on the course and the end job.;Acquiring new knowledge and skills can be achieved through various pathways. While traditional educational routes, such as attending school followed by college or university, are widely accepted and respected in today's society, they may not always be the most effective or suitable approach. For some individuals and certain professions, a more vocational route may be more appropriate. Universities are generally held in high esteem, and as a result, many schools design their programs to facilitate university admission. These institutions often boast respected and highly qualified instructors who possess the expertise to guide students to advanced levels of knowledge and proficiency. The rigorous process of gaining admission, completing coursework, and passing final exams demonstrates to employers that graduates possess the necessary self-discipline, intelligence, and ability to succeed.Universities are particularly well-suited for teaching subjects like medicine, law, and literature, which require students' full-time attention to excel. Although practical experience is essential, a strong foundation in fundamental concepts is crucial. Once this foundation is established, students can integrate their knowledge with practical understanding.However, not all areas of learning necessitate extensive high-level knowledge or full-time study. Certain professions, such as electricians or plumbers, require a balance of theoretical understanding and hands-on experience. In these cases, learning can be effectively accomplished through a combination of work and study, often via apprenticeships and vocational courses that incorporate significant work experience.In conclusion, I believe that there are multiple pathways to acquiring a profession. The decision to learn through university study alone or while working depends on the specific course and intended career. Ultimately, the most effective approach will vary depending on the individual's goals and the requirements of their chosen profession.
1288;Many people in cities today live in high-rise apartment blocks. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this type of living?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;High-rise apartment blocks are a common sight in cities around the world. They are especially popular in large cities and in locations where building land is scarce. Living in such buildings has various advantages and disadvantages for town planners and the inhabitants themselves.The most significant advantage of high-rise apartment blocks is probably for the town planners. With land often being at a premium in large cities, one way to maximise space is to build upwards, so that the population density per square kilometre can be increased. The demand for housing in big cities can therefore be more easily met. There are also disadvantages for town planners. The heavier population density can put added pressure on social facilities, for example sewage and other waste disposal, and the provision of adequate school and medical services.There are also advantages and disadvantages for the actual inhabitants of high-rise apartment blocks. With the demand for housing being reduced, prices are therefore not as high, making housing more affordable. Many people also like not having to be responsible for a garden, and living in an apartment has this advantage. Finally, with so many people living in the same area, many friendships can be made and a community spirit can be built up. It appears the most significant disadvantage is that, in practice, living in high-rise apartment blocks is just not the lifestyle many people want. In some city neighbourhoods, these living spaces can often be associated with poor living conditions and undesirable social elements. In addition, many people view high-rise apartment blocks as being unsafe. For example, in the case of fire, tall buildings are difficult or impossible to evacuate safely.It is clear that high-rise apartment blocks have benefits and drawbacks. It is also clear, however, that due to the need to house increasing numbers of people in cities, these architectural features are here to stay, whether people like them or not.;High-rise apartment buildings are a ubiquitous feature of urban landscapes worldwide, particularly in large cities where land is limited. For urban planners, these structures offer a significant advantage: maximizing space by building upwards, which increases population density and helps meet the high demand for housing in metropolitan areas. However, this increased density also puts a strain on public facilities such as waste management, schools, and healthcare services. On the other hand, residents of high-rise apartments can benefit from more affordable housing options, reduced maintenance responsibilities, and a sense of community that can develop among the large number of people living in close proximity. Nevertheless, many individuals are put off by the lifestyle associated with high-rise living, which is often linked to poor living conditions, safety concerns, and undesirable social elements. The difficulty in evacuating tall buildings in emergency situations, such as fires, is a notable concern. Despite these drawbacks, high-rise apartment blocks are likely to remain a permanent feature of urban landscapes due to the pressing need to accommodate the growing urban population. Ultimately, while high-rise apartment blocks present both benefits and disadvantages for planners and residents alike, their presence is a necessity in the face of urbanization and the scarcity of land in large cities.
789;Many people now undertake extreme activities, from hang-gliding to mountain climbing.Why do people risk their lives in this way, and do you think this is a good trend?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Extreme sports, such as mountain climbing and hand-gliding, have become increasingly popular over the past several decades. Now more than ever, athletes can be paid to do these activities full-time, encouraging more aspiring athletes to enter extreme sports. In addition, the addictive nature of these activities means that participants tend to stay in the sport for the thrill. While the increased popularity can result in more accidents, it can also make the sports safer as atheletes collectively learn from past mistakes.While people have undertaken extreme activities long before the advent of television and social media, these new platforms give extreme sports the much needed sponsorship and attention. Nowadays, outlandish and dangerous acts can be televised and monetized, giving the athletes a way to make a living out of these events. Therefore, more people would feel encouraged to participate in these activities knowing that they can have a decent income. On top of the external motivation, most extreme athletes take part in these sports because they are thrilling and addicting. These atheletes chase the rush and validation that they get when doing dangerous activities. As a result, even without the external rewards, some people would still partake in these sports.Given that people are motivated both internally and externally to participate in extreme sports, it is inevitable that these activities become more popular. While it is true that increased participation would result in more accidents, it would also create more lessons for future participants. In this way, these accidents and injuries would help educate future athletes on how to protect themselves. Moreoever, this increased popularity would also encourage governments to draft more safety regulations.In conclusion, given that it is human nature to want to achieve feats of strength and courage, extreme sports would always be attractive for some. Because of this, there will always be people injuring themselves while pursuing these feats. Therefore, these activities would become safer the more athletes learn from past incidents.;The popularity of extreme sports, such as mountain climbing and hand-gliding, has skyrocketed over the past few decades. This surge in popularity has led to increased opportunities for athletes to pursue these activities full-time, with many receiving payment for their participation. The thrill-seeking nature of these sports also ensures that participants tend to remain committed, driven by the addictive rush of adrenaline. While the growing popularity of extreme sports may lead to a higher incidence of accidents, it also has a positive effect: as athletes collectively learn from past mistakes, the sports become safer.The advent of television and social media has been a significant factor in the growth of extreme sports, providing the necessary sponsorship and attention to catapult these activities into the mainstream. Nowadays, daredevil acts can be televised and monetized, offering athletes a viable means of earning a living. This, in turn, encourages more people to participate, secure in the knowledge that they can earn a decent income. However, it's not just external motivation that drives extreme athletes - many are drawn to these sports because of the inherent thrill and addictive nature of the activities themselves. The validation and rush that come with pushing boundaries are powerful internal motivators, driving some individuals to participate regardless of external rewards.Given the dual forces of internal and external motivation, it's inevitable that extreme sports will continue to gain popularity. While increased participation may lead to more accidents, it also creates a valuable repository of lessons for future participants. These accidents and injuries serve as a catalyst for education, teaching future athletes how to better protect themselves. Moreover, the rising popularity of extreme sports is likely to prompt governments to establish more stringent safety regulations, further mitigating the risks involved.In conclusion, extreme sports tap into fundamental aspects of human nature - the desire to achieve feats of strength and courage. As such, these activities will always hold a certain allure, and with this comes the inevitable risk of injury. However, as athletes learn from past incidents, these sports will inherently become safer. The cycle of participation, accident, and education will continue, ultimately contributing to the evolution of extreme sports into safer, yet still thrilling, pursuits.
1345;Many people support animal testing while others believe it isn’t appropriate (discuss);Many people support use of animals for testing medicines for humans. Others believe it isn’t appropriate to use animals for such experiments. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayApproval of the medicines for human use is a tedious process which involves a series of tests often performed on animals. While some people support this idea because it makes drugs safer for human consumption, others believe that it is an unethical practice. Personally, I am in favour of the idea that medicines should be tested in all possible scenarios before being released to the public.Those against animal experimentation argue that animals have the same rights as human beings because they are the outcome of the same evolution process through which humans came into existence. Infecting them with viruses and exposing them to bacteria, to create a conducive environment to test a chemical substance may cause excruciating pain to these lab animals. Any failed test can mean that the subject either loses its precious life or suffers for the rest of its existence, and understandably, some people are against what they consider an immoral practice.Nonetheless, if a drug is released into the market without a thorough end-to-end testing, it could cause severe damage to anyone who may consume it. Every day a large number of animals are being mercilessly killed by humans for their mere flesh and skin. There isn’t a big difference between killing an animal for food and sacrificing its life for testing a chemical composition, because both actions are helping the human race to survive. What’s more, the life of one animal used to test a life-saving drug could help many people live. This is why a large number of people believe that testing drugs on animals is a matter of survival.To sum up, there are valid reasons why animal testing seems cruel and unacceptable to some, and crucial to others. In my opinion, even though animals subjected to testing may suffer, it is a necessary step to ensure the healing power of a drug.;The use of animals in testing medicines for human consumption is a contentious issue, with some individuals advocating for the practice and others vehemently opposing it. On one hand, proponents of animal testing argue that it is a crucial step in ensuring the safety and efficacy of drugs for human use. This process, which involves a series of rigorous tests on animals, is seen as essential for identifying potential harmful side effects and confirming the therapeutic benefits of a medication before it is released to the public. From this perspective, the suffering or even sacrifice of a few animals can be justified if it leads to the saving of countless human lives through the development of life-saving drugs.On the other hand, there are those who strongly believe that using animals for such experiments is unethical and inhumane. They argue that animals, as living beings that have evolved alongside humans, possess inherent rights and should not be subjected to pain, distress, or death for the sake of scientific advancement. The argument is that infecting animals with diseases or exposing them to harmful substances to test drug efficacy is morally reprehensible, especially considering the potential for immense suffering and the inevitability of death for many test subjects.Personally, I align with the view that the testing of medicines on animals is a necessary evil. While it is undeniable that animal testing can cause significant distress and harm to the animals involved, the alternative - releasing untested or inadequately tested drugs into the human population - poses a far greater risk. The daily slaughter of animals for food, clothing, and other human needs already dwarfs the numbers used in scientific research, suggesting a utilitarian argument can be made for the controlled use of animals in medical research if it ultimately benefits human health and survival.Moreover, the development and testing of life-saving drugs rely heavily on animal models to understand disease mechanisms, test drug efficacy, and assess safety profiles before human trials can even be considered. The advancement of medical science, particularly in fields like oncology, virology, and neurology, has been significantly facilitated by animal research. The ethical use of animals in research, with stringent guidelines to minimize suffering and ensure the humane treatment of animals, can be seen as a justified means to a profoundly important end: the preservation of human life and the alleviation of suffering.In conclusion, while there are compelling arguments on both sides of the debate regarding the use of animals in medical testing, the benefits of ensuring drug safety and efficacy for humans cannot be overlooked. It is a complex issue that requires a balanced approach, recognizing both the moral concerns and the greater good that
327;Many people think modern communication technology is having some negative effects on social relationships. Do you agree or disagree?;It is undeniable that nowadays, smart devices such as phones and tablets play an essential role in one's life. Through countless websites and applications, people can connect with each other without any boundaries. While many people agree that the introduction of these technologies has many disadvantages to the conservative way of starting and maintaining relationships, I personally believe that they rather develop new socializing methods.First and foremost, social medias and applications can help with keeping in touch with acquintances. Previously, people had to follow a precise time and location to meet up with their friends as they are unable to contact the others to reschedule. However, the internet allows them to update their plans at any time. This means that if there is any emergency, an individual can immediately postpone the upcoming event and find the next available slot to continue the plan. Furthermore, there are several applications that allow people to video call their friends and family who are currently living apart.The current technologies not only offer us options to communicate with our current contacts but also allow us to discover new friends. In the past, it is difficult to find people with a common interest which had to be done through social events. Nowadays, online communities enable their users to connect with new friends virtually. Thus, fewer individuals are left alone, especially introverts and those who are living in remote areas which can have difficulties socializing offline.All in all, despite the fact that there are many positive impacts of the invention of social medias and communication technologies, there are also risks and downsides of using them without face-to-face communication. Therefore, the time used for socializing online and offline should always be balanced.;The significance of smart devices, such as phones and tablets, in our daily lives is unmistakable. With the vast array of websites and applications available, people can now connect with one another without geographical or temporal constraints. Although some argue that these technologies have undermined traditional methods of forming and maintaining relationships, I firmly believe that they have paved the way for novel socializing techniques.Primarily, social media and apps have made it easier to stay in touch with acquaintances. In the past, meeting up with friends required adhering to a fixed schedule and location, as rescheduling was often impractical. However, the internet has enabled individuals to update their plans at any time, allowing for greater flexibility. For instance, in the event of an emergency, one can promptly postpone an upcoming gathering and schedule an alternative time. Moreover, various apps facilitate video calls with friends and family members who are physically distant.These technologies not only facilitate communication with existing contacts but also provide avenues for discovering new friendships. Historically, finding like-minded individuals was a challenging task that relied on social events. Nowadays, online communities empower users to connect with new friends virtually, thereby reducing the number of individuals who feel isolated, particularly introverts and those residing in remote areas where offline socialization is difficult.In conclusion, while the advent of social media and communication technologies has had numerous positive impacts, it is crucial to acknowledge the risks and downsides associated with excessive online socialization, which can supplant face-to-face interaction. Consequently, it is essential to strike a balance between the time devoted to online and offline socializing, ensuring that these technologies complement, rather than replace, traditional socializing methods.
837;Many people today, especially in the developed world, are choosing to have fewer children, or none at all.Why is this happening, and do you think it is a good trend?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Weather to have children or not is one of the most important questions young adults have to ask themselfs nowadays. Overpopulation is one of the many global problems next to climate change, and poverty.In my opinion, the need to have children roots back to us being nothing more, but civilised animals. Animals have one goal above all; reproduce. This is why in many cultures, men and women who cannot have chlidren are seen as disabled, or sick. Nowadays, modern values changed our perspective, having children is often seen as a necessity for a happy, and successful life.It is important to recognise the problems the developed world faces. There is smoke in the air, plastic pollution everywhere, poverty in third world countries, and many other factors that make Earth a terrible place for many. Above all, the life we give birth to will have to eat, drink, and consume just like everyone else, using more and more of the already limited resources, generating more and more trash.Many people argue that the above mentioned points are a pessimistic and unrealistic. Humans have to reproduce, to keep the species from extintion. And truthfully the only way to do that, is to give birth as many kids as possible. This issue lies deep in our society; here in Hungary, a family is rewared almost 30000 USD if they have 3 or more kids. This means that many people have children because they get money for it, and they are also seen socially accepted.I believe modern day intelligence goes further than IQ points and money earned. We have to recognise the problems created, overpopulation being one of them. While I do not believe that we should not have kids, I think there should be careful planning involved and self-reflection before giving birth to new life.";Deciding whether or not to have children is one of the most critical questions young adults face today. With global issues like overpopulation, climate change, and poverty looming large, it's essential to reconsider our priorities. In my view, the desire to have children stems from our fundamental nature as civilized animals. The primary instinct of animals is to reproduce, which is why, in many cultures, individuals who cannot have children are often stigmatized as being disabled or sick. However, modern values have shifted our perspective, and having children is now often seen as a prerequisite for a happy and successful life.It's crucial to acknowledge the problems the developed world is grappling with, including air pollution, plastic waste, poverty in developing countries, and numerous other factors that make the Earth a challenging place for many. Moreover, the life we bring into the world will inevitably consume resources, generate waste, and contribute to the already overwhelming demand on the planet's limited resources.Some argue that these concerns are overly pessimistic and unrealistic, emphasizing that human reproduction is necessary to prevent the extinction of our species. They advocate for having as many children as possible to ensure the survival of humanity. This mindset is deeply ingrained in our society, as evident in countries like Hungary, where families are incentivized with approximately $30,000 if they have three or more children. This has led to a situation where many people have children primarily for financial benefits and social acceptance.I believe that modern intelligence encompasses more than just intellectual quotient or financial success. It's about recognizing the problems we've created, including overpopulation. While I don't advocate for completely abstaining from having children, I strongly believe in the importance of careful planning and self-reflection before bringing new life into the world. This thoughtful approach can help mitigate the challenges posed by overpopulation and contribute to a more sustainable future.
1317;Many people try to achieve a work-life balance but fail. Why is this happening? What can be done to help people overcome this problem?;Many people strive to achieve a work-life balance, but often find themselves failing despite their best efforts. This is not surprising, as balancing work and life commitments can be extremely difficult due to both having their unique stressors.One of the major reasons why so many people struggle to achieve harmony between their personal and professional lives is that now it is easier than ever for people to stay connected outside of regular work hours. This has led to an expectation that employees should always be available, and they risk being seen as unreliable or uncommitted if they are not. A knock-on effect of longer working hours is that little time is left for leisure activities such as socialising or engaging in hobbies or sports, which help reduce stress levels and improve overall well-being. This type of pressure and lack of free time can lead to feelings of burnout, with no respite from life’s pressures, resulting in chronic fatigue and diminished motivation over time.Helping those struggling to find a suitable work-life balance will require joint efforts of managers and employees. Workers, for instance, need to recognise the importance of taking regular breaks throughout the day and getting enough sleep each night, while employers should consider being more flexible when it comes to allowing staff to work remotely and offering paid vacation days. This will give employees space, both mentally and physically, enabling them to better manage their commitments without overextending themselves.In conclusion, achieving a successful work-life balance is something that many cannot quite reach due to external pressures from employers and a lack of downtime. However, these issues can be overcome, if we create realistic boundaries between our professional lives and personal goals, and make conscious decisions about how we want to spend our time.;Attaining a balance between work and personal life is a goal that many people strive for, yet often find elusive despite their best endeavors. The challenge of juggling work and personal commitments is inherently daunting, as both spheres come with their own distinct stressors. A significant obstacle to achieving harmony between professional and personal life stems from the ease of staying connected outside regular working hours, which has cultivated an expectation that employees should be perpetually available. Failure to meet this expectation can lead to perceptions of unreliability or lack of commitment. The consequence of extended working hours is a scarcity of time for leisure activities such as socializing, hobbies, or sports, which are essential for stress alleviation and overall well-being enhancement. This relentless pressure, coupled with a dearth of free time, can precipitate feelings of burnout, characterized by an absence of reprieve from life's pressures, culminating in chronic fatigue and dwindling motivation over time.Mitigating the struggle to achieve a work-life balance necessitates a collaborative effort from both managers and employees. Employees must acknowledge the significance of incorporating regular breaks into their daily routine and ensuring adequate sleep each night. Conversely, employers should embrace flexibility, particularly in allowing remote work arrangements and offering paid vacation days, thereby providing employees with the mental and physical space to manage their commitments without overextension.In essence, achieving a successful work-life balance remains an elusive goal for many, hindered by external pressures from employers and a paucity of downtime. Nonetheless, these challenges can be surmounted by establishing realistic boundaries between professional and personal aspects of life and making conscious decisions regarding time allocation. This approach enables individuals to navigate their commitments effectively, ultimately leading to a more balanced and fulfilling life.
1298;Many schoolchildren today take part in work experience sessions for short periods of time instead of attending school. Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It has been a popular trend for some time now to put children into what can be called ‘work experience placements’. The children are taken out of school and take part in various types of work, usually for around a week. Some people criticise this trend, but I can’t see how it can be a negative experience.One of the criticisms is that children lose a week of schoolwork. With the pressure to do well at school increasing, children need every bit of help to maximise their potential. Taking them out of the school, it is therefore argued, stops them from getting access to needed education for a whole week. As the students won’t really be of much help to a workplace for just one week, it would therefore be better for them to remain at school.While this is a valid point, taking a child’s entire experience of school into account, a single week away does not make a significant difference. Indeed, if the timing of the week’s work placements is done correctly, the week can also serve as a kind of ‘holiday’ away from school, something that is regularly needed in order to allow students to remain fresh and enthusiastic. In many work placements, children also get to see some of things they learn at school put into a realistic context, allowing them to understand the relevance of what they learn and thereby creating a way to reinforce the learning.In addition to this, schoolchildren can be quite nervous about the world of work that they will have to join at some point in their lives. By getting this short taste of what it is like, they can see that it is nothing to be scared about. As well as this, children will often have some ideas of what they want to do for a living, but are not sure. By allowing them to see a type of work they are considering, they are better able to decide whether that career could be suitable for them.I feel, therefore, that work placements can be seen as a positive development. Missing a short amount of school is not serious and the benefits that can be gained from the placements are significant.;"For some time now, it has been a common practice to enroll children in ""work experience placements,"" where they participate in various work activities for approximately a week, outside of their regular school schedule. Although some people have criticized this trend, I believe it has numerous benefits and cannot see any significant drawbacks. One of the primary criticisms is that children miss a week of schooling, which can be detrimental given the increasing pressure to perform well academically. The argument is that since children are unlikely to make a substantial contribution to the workplace in just one week, it would be more beneficial for them to remain in school and utilize the time to maximize their learning potential. However, considering the broader context of a child's educational experience, a single week away from school is unlikely to have a significant impact. In fact, if timed correctly, the work placement week can serve as a beneficial break, allowing students to recharge and maintain their enthusiasm for learning. Many work placements also provide children with the opportunity to see the practical application of concepts they learn in school, which can help reinforce their understanding and emphasize the relevance of their education.Furthermore, work placements can help alleviate the anxiety that many schoolchildren feel about entering the workforce. By providing a brief glimpse into the world of work, children can become more comfortable with the idea of joining the workforce in the future. Additionally, work placements can help children who are undecided about their future careers make more informed decisions. By experiencing a particular type of work, they can better determine whether it is a suitable fit for them.In conclusion, I believe that work placements are a positive development. The brief time missed from school is negligible compared to the numerous benefits that can be gained from these placements. Overall, work experience placements offer a valuable opportunity for children to gain practical experience, alleviate anxiety about the workforce, and make more informed decisions about their future careers."
1413;Millions of people every year move to English- speaking countries such as Australia, Britain or America, in order to study at school, college or university. Why do so many people want to study in English? Why is English such an important international language?;Nowadays, language becomes a major factor to . Many people prefer to study abroad English-speaking country because English is an international language. There is no doubt that the best way to improve the English language skill is to use the English language daily so if people study in English speaking countries, their will be improved automatically and it will give them some advantages such as work in many countries or they will be to many different places without studying other languages. This essay will describe in detail why English is an important international language.Firstly, the English language is widely used in many countries and at present, the world traders are currently developing rapidly. In order to compete with people from different countries, it is to be able to communicate the English language. For example, China has been improving a lot in many sectors. They are able to compete with other countries because many people in China English language and they are trying hard to study English.Secondly, many companies prefer to employ people who can speak English because if the companies create new in different countries, the employers are able to move the new branch without new people and the branch company is still able to communicate with the central company. In fact, one of the largest companies in the world (Google) has created some in different countries and each of the Google is able to discuss things or otherwise communicate even though they are in different countries because they all use English to communicate.In conclusion, many people move to English speaking countries for further studies because they believe that it will improve their English skills and in order to become a successful person in the future, mastering English is .;In today's world, language proficiency has become a crucial aspect of personal and professional development. Many individuals choose to study abroad in English-speaking countries because English has become the global language of communication. It is widely acknowledged that the most effective way to enhance English language skills is to use the language on a daily basis. Consequently, studying in English-speaking countries can lead to significant improvements in language proficiency, providing individuals with a competitive edge in the global job market and enabling them to travel and work in multiple countries without the need to learn additional languages. This essay aims to provide an in-depth examination of the importance of English as an international language.Firstly, English is the most widely used language globally, and its significance is particularly evident in the rapidly evolving world of international trade. To remain competitive in a global marketplace, proficiency in English is essential for effective communication across different countries. For instance, China's rapid advancements in various sectors can be attributed, in part, to the widespread adoption of English among its population. The Chinese are recognizing the importance of English and are making considerable efforts to improve their English language skills, which has enabled them to compete more effectively with other nations.Secondly, many multinational companies prefer to hire individuals with English language skills because it facilitates the establishment of branches in different countries. When companies expand internationally, they can easily relocate existing employees to manage new branches without the need for additional hiring, ensuring seamless communication between the central office and international branches. A notable example is Google, one of the world's largest companies, which has established offices in various countries. Despite geographical distances, Google offices worldwide can communicate and discuss matters effectively, thanks to their use of English as a common language.In conclusion, the trend of moving to English-speaking countries for further education is motivated by the belief that it will enhance one's English skills, a crucial factor for future success. Mastering English is seen as indispensable for achieving personal and professional goals in an increasingly interconnected world.
795;Missions to explore space are hugely expensive, and there are problems on Earth which demand attention. The number of these missions needs to be reduced.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is supposed by many, that high-cost space studies should be cut off while more focus should be paid to the challenges mankind face on Earth. This essay completely disargees with such view because of two reasons that will de developed further.The first reason is that only rich countries spend thier budgets for space studies. This means that only when states have resolved most of their problems with poverty, level of medicine treatment, safety, they can divert some of the funds to invest in future technologies. Moreover, citizens will go on a strike and make the govenment to deal with real life problems instead of dreaming about the space. For example, not more than 5% of USA GDP is spent on space programs that is sufficient to progress, construct new sputniks, and send astronauts to the Internations Space Station.The second argument supposes that many space technologies have a dual puropose. In other words, being initially developed for studing the space, they were adopted to make people's day-to-day life easier. For example, mobile phones and the mobile Internet, navigaion using GPS would not be possibe if people were not trying to explore space.In conclusion, new technologies are developed when people are trying to learn the world outside our planet. This;Many people believe that expensive space research should be discontinued, with the focus shifting to addressing the pressing challenges faced by humanity on Earth. However, this essay disagrees with this perspective, presenting two key arguments to support its stance.Firstly, it is primarily affluent nations that allocate their budgets to space exploration. This implies that only when countries have largely overcome issues such as poverty, inadequate medical treatment, and safety concerns can they realistically divert funds towards investing in futuristic technologies. Furthermore, if a government were to prioritize space studies over more immediate concerns, citizens would likely protest, compelling their government to address real-world problems rather than pursuing space exploration. For instance, the United States spends no more than 5% of its GDP on space programs, a sufficient amount to drive progress, build new satellites, and send astronauts to the International Space Station.The second argument suggests that numerous space technologies have dual-purpose applications. In essence, technologies initially developed for space exploration have been adapted to enhance daily life on Earth. For example, the development of mobile phones, mobile internet, and GPS navigation systems was facilitated by efforts to explore space. Without these space-related endeavors, such technologies might not be available today.In conclusion, the pursuit of space knowledge drives the development of new technologies, which, in turn, can improve life on Earth.

It relies heavily on new technology, which has greatly enhanced our understanding of the human body. In my opinion, modern medicine plays a crucial role in increasing human lifespan. Firstly, modern medicine has the ability to prevent and cure previously incurable diseases. With the help of advanced technology, doctors can diagnose diseases at a very early stage, allowing for timely and effective treatment. This has significantly improved the quality of life for many individuals, particularly the intelligent and creative people who contribute greatly to society. Their longevity enables them to share their knowledge and experience with others for a longer period, which is invaluable to human society. Moreover, the increasing lifespan of the older population has numerous benefits, including the preservation of cultural heritage and the passing down of valuable life experiences to younger generations.However, it is also important to acknowledge the drawbacks of modern medicine. One significant concern is that some people may become overly dependent on medication, requiring it for the rest of their lives. Furthermore, the high cost of modern medicine makes it inaccessible to many people, especially in poorer countries. This has led to modern medicine taking on a commercial shape, where treatment is often dependent on one's financial resources rather than their medical needs. In contrast, indigenous medicine tends to be more human-friendly and less dependent on financial means.In conclusion, while I recognize the limitations and drawbacks of modern medicine, I firmly believe that its benefits in extending human lifespan and improving quality of life far outweigh its disadvantages. The integration of modern technologies into medical practice has been instrumental in early disease detection and effective treatment. Therefore, I agree that modern medicine is essential for living a long and healthy life, and I support its continued development and application in the medical field.
1315;More and more people today are drinking sugar-based drinks. Why is this happening? What measures can be taken to reverse this trend?;An alarming number of people today consume sugar-based drinks, whether it is in the form of soda, energy drinks or fruit drinks. Often consumers are lured by their widespread availability and convenience, however, marketing campaigns also play a role, targeting young people and giving them the perception that sugary drinks are not as unhealthy as they actually are.The availability of these types of drinks has greatly increased over time. They can now be found in almost any store or restaurant, which makes them easily accessible to almost anyone. The fact that they are often cheaper than alternatives, such as water or freshly squeezed juice, makes them an especially attractive option for those on a budget. Marketing campaigns for sugary beverages have been quite successful in creating positive associations attached to these products through advertisements on TV and billboards. This encourages people to consider them fun rather than unhealthy and normalises them within society.Luckily, reversing the rise in popularity of sugary drinks is still possible, if we act now and attack the problem from different angles. One of the very first steps should be educating people on the health risks associated with high sugar intake so that they can make better-informed decisions when selecting what type of beverage they consume. Companies should also be held accountable by law for their misleading marketing campaigns aimed at children and teenagers who are more likely to believe the false claims about their products’ health benefits without fully understanding what’s being sold to them. Schools, colleges and universities, and any institutions catering for young people, should consider banning sugary drinks and replacing them with refreshing alternatives without added sugar.Overall, it is important that we recognise the potential health risks posed by consuming too much sugar from soft drinks and take actionable steps towards reversing this trend in order to ensure our long-term wellbeing. Through greater education, government regulation, and increased corporate responsibility we can ensure that more people understand why reducing their intake of sugary beverages is important while still allowing them to access enjoyable yet healthier options.;The consumption of sugar-based drinks has reached alarming levels, with many individuals opting for soda, energy drinks, and fruit juices. The widespread availability and convenience of these beverages, as well as clever marketing campaigns, have contributed to their popularity. These campaigns often target young people, downplaying the health risks associated with sugary drinks and creating a false perception of their safety. Over time, the availability of these drinks has increased significantly, making them easily accessible in stores, restaurants, and other establishments. Their affordability, particularly when compared to alternatives like water or freshly squeezed juice, makes them an attractive option for budget-conscious consumers. Successful marketing efforts have fostered a positive image of these products through advertisements, leading people to view them as fun and normal rather than unhealthy.Fortunately, it's still possible to reverse the growing popularity of sugary drinks by taking a multi-faceted approach. Education is key, and one of the first steps should be to inform people about the health risks linked to high sugar consumption, enabling them to make more informed choices. Companies must also be held accountable for their misleading marketing tactics aimed at young people, who are more susceptible to false claims about the health benefits of their products. Institutions that cater to young people, such as schools and universities, should consider removing sugary drinks from their premises and replacing them with healthier, sugar-free alternatives. It's essential to acknowledge the potential health risks of excessive sugar consumption from soft drinks and take concrete steps to reverse this trend, ensuring our long-term wellbeing. By promoting education, government regulation, and corporate responsibility, we can raise awareness about the importance of reducing sugary beverage intake while still providing access to enjoyable, healthier options.
1259;More people decided to have children in their later age than in the past. Why?Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"Over the past decades, it has been registered a considerable decrease in the percentage of people eager to create a family at a young age. There could be different reasons for this and I am going to state them clearly in the following paragraphs, which will also explain why I believe the advantages of this situation far outweigh the disadvantages.Apparently, the society we currently live in has undergone substantial changes over the years, sometimes without us even noticing it. The most evident of these variations has probably been the gradual rise in the number of old people as opposed to the dramatic fall in the number of births. In fact, owing to the decline of the economy of most nations and the subsequent reduction of work opportunities, more and more people are giving up on the idea of becoming parents in their 20s or 30s. Many people see this as a negative aspect for our society; however, I have to strongly disagree with their opinion.The drawbacks to which a lot of people point out when discussing about these kind of topics often has to do with the age gap between parents and their children. Admittedly, someone cannot decide to have a child in their 40s without considering the significant generation gap that would separate them from their kids and, as a result, the issues of miscommunication that could arise.However, the disadvantages become of secondary importance as soon as the much more remarkable benefits are examined. First of all, older parents also means more responsible and mature caretakers; consequently, due to their broader life experience, they would arguably make better advisors for their kids. Not to mention that older parents would not only have more stable and secure jobs, but they would also have more consistent savings to devote to their children's further education, which in turn could help the latter having a better and well-paid job in the future.To conclude, although it's impossible not to take into account the drawbacks of having a child at a more advanced age, the advantages still outrun the disadvantages. Thus, children would be the first to benefit from such a situation.";Over the past few decades, there has been a notable decline in the number of people eager to start a family at a young age. This trend can be attributed to various factors, which will be discussed in the following paragraphs. I firmly believe that the benefits of this shift far outweigh the drawbacks, and I will explain why.Our society has undergone significant changes in recent years, some of which may have gone unnoticed. One of the most striking changes is the increasing number of older adults and the corresponding decrease in birth rates. The economic downturn in many countries, resulting in reduced job opportunities, has led many people to postpone or abandon their plans to become parents in their 20s or 30s. While some people view this as a negative development, I strongly disagree.One common concern raised about this trend is the potential age gap between parents and their children. It is true that having a child in one's 40s can lead to a significant generation gap, which may cause communication issues. However, these drawbacks become less significant when compared to the substantial benefits of older parenthood. Older parents tend to be more responsible and mature caregivers, making them better advisors for their children due to their broader life experience. Moreover, older parents are more likely to have stable and secure jobs, as well as consistent savings, which can be devoted to their children's education, ultimately leading to better job prospects for the children in the future.In conclusion, while it is essential to acknowledge the potential drawbacks of having children at an advanced age, the advantages still outweigh the disadvantages. Ultimately, children are likely to benefit the most from this trend, as they will have more mature, responsible, and financially secure parents who can provide them with better guidance and opportunities.
1425;Most high level positions in companies are filled by men, even though the workforce in many developed countries consists of 50 percent female workers. Companies should be required to allocate a certain percentage of management positions to women. Discuss, what is your opinion?;"The inequality between men and women has always been a significant issue in society. , it is undeniable that most vital positions in companies are taken by males, not females. Therefore, that companies should allocate to women a certain number of these positions. However, I do not agree with this requirement completely.In some feudal countries, it was true to say that the society the males, and at that time instances of inequality occurred very frequently. Up until the present moment, it in some developing countries; also it is greatly . A large number of women in these countries are not allowed to go to work or even go to . In this case, this is not an individual issue, but social problem. The governments should have some solution to this tendency, and at the same time they should promulgate a new legislation to protect women’s .On the other hand, the global economy is developing rapidly nowadays. In most corporations, distinguish men from women; they only focus on working efficiently. In this world, any employees who possess enough abilities and work in an effective way, be promoted to positions. Therefore, allocating the high level positions in companies to women is not necessary. Moreover, the instances of women in essential positions . Those women are very successful in their work and their lives.In conclusion, although the inequality between men and women has reduced, it still is a social issue worth . Personally, in my opinion we should create as many opportunities for women to have an equal life as we can.";The disparity between men and women has long been a pressing concern in society, with males predominantly occupying key positions in companies. To address this, some advocate for companies to reserve a certain number of these positions for women. However, I only partially agree with this requirement.Historically, in some feudal societies, men held dominant roles, leading to frequent instances of inequality. Even today, in some developing countries, this issue persists, with many women being denied the right to work or even access education. This is a societal problem that governments should address through comprehensive solutions and new legislation to protect women's rights.On the other hand, the global economy is rapidly evolving, with most corporations focusing on efficiency rather than gender. Employees who demonstrate sufficient abilities and work effectively can be promoted to higher positions, regardless of gender. Therefore, allocating high-level positions specifically to women may not be necessary. In fact, there are numerous examples of women who have achieved great success in their careers and lives while holding essential positions.In conclusion, although the gender gap has narrowed, it remains a significant social issue. In my opinion, we should strive to create as many opportunities as possible for women to lead equal lives. By doing so, we can work towards a more balanced and equitable society. 
1390;News editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in a newspaper. What factors do you think influence their decisions? Do we become used to bad news? Would it be better if more good news was reported?;. There are two factors that influence their decisions. The first is the kind of customers they aim at. each kind of readers and watchers has its own features. For example, if your customers are almost entirely teenagers, you have to concentrate on something attracting them such as stories, photographs of singer stars, film stars, funny tales, and fashion. It be very silly if you to provide teenagers with economic or news. On the contrary, and politicians may never read news about James Blunt or Keira Knightley. Therefore, what influences news editors’ decisions the most is the taste of their customers.The second factor is how hot and attractive the news is. Who or watch news from a year or a month ago or even about something that happened last week? The answer is . In the energetic and competitive world nowadays, people always ask for a really news. So that to satisfy customers, there is a pressure on all editors to find continually what has already happened not only yesterday but even an hour ago. Or else, they may lose their customers. None of editors wants that bleak future.The type of news is also an important consideration. Whether on television or in newspapers, we seem to get more of and become used to bad news. It is harder for us to come across a piece of good news. We can’t deny that bad things happen on Earth day by day. However, news editors try to gain more and more , which means more and more money, using bad news as a magnet. bad news makes us curious. We want to know why it is bad, what it is about, whether it influences us or not. As a result, we will buy newspapers or watch television to find out. And the happiest people are, of course, news editors.In my view it would be better if more good news reported. Bad news makes us good news makes us happy. There should an an equal amount of good and bad news. In that way we can give something bad a lot of thought while still being happy about the good news. Any inequalities between good news and bad news should be avoided. Nowadays we cannot live without news, and for that reason the role of news editors became very important. We should support them, and in turn they should try their best to provide us with useful news, both good and bad.;There are two key factors that influence the decisions of news editors. The first factor is the type of audience they cater to. Different readers and viewers have unique preferences. For instance, if the target audience is predominantly teenagers, the focus should be on content that appeals to them, such as stories, photographs of celebrities, humorous tales, and fashion trends. It would be impractical to provide teenagers with economic or news analysis, as it may not resonate with them. In contrast, politicians and business professionals may not be interested in news about entertainment personalities like James Blunt or Keira Knightley. Therefore, the primary consideration for news editors is the taste and preferences of their audience.The second factor is the timeliness and appeal of the news. Who wants to read or watch news that is a year, a month, or even a week old? In today's fast-paced and competitive world, people demand current and relevant news. To satisfy their audience, news editors face pressure to continually find and report on recent events, sometimes even as they unfold. Failure to do so may result in losing their audience, a prospect no editor wants to face.The type of news is also a crucial consideration. We seem to be exposed to more bad news than good, whether on television or in newspapers. It's undeniable that negative events occur daily, but news editors often use bad news as a magnet to attract more viewers or readers, which translates to more revenue. Bad news piques our curiosity, making us want to know more about the story and its implications. As a result, we buy newspapers or watch television to stay informed, and news editors reap the benefits.In my opinion, it would be beneficial to have a more balanced reporting of good and bad news. Bad news can be informative, but it also has a negative impact on our mood and outlook. Good news, on the other hand, can uplift and inspire us. Ideally, there should be an equal amount of both types of news, allowing us to stay informed about the challenges we face while also appreciating the positive developments. Avoiding disparities between good and bad news is essential. In today's world, where news is an integral part of our lives, the role of news editors has become increasingly important. We should support them, and in return, they should strive to provide us with a balanced and informative mix of news.
1321;Newspapers have a significant influence on people’s ideas and opinions. Why is this happening? Is it a positive or negative situation?;Many people believe that newspapers play a pivotal role in shaping the way we think. There are numerous ways in which this affects our society, and I believe that this influence is mostly negative.Newspapers have long been a source of valuable information that has kept societies abreast of the latest happenings in the world. Since the average citizen has minimal knowledge about the information in expert analysis articles, well-established newspapers are powerfully poised to form public opinion through attention-grabbing images and carefully worded commentary. This leaves the reader no choice but to trust the accuracy of what they have read.Sadly, unbiased objectivity, which used to be the core idea behind journalism, seems to be a thing of the past. The arrival and spread of social media platforms has caused a gradual decline in print media subscriptions and their circulation, since readers tend to favor the internet and social media to stay informed about current affairs. This gave rise to a worrying trend of newspapers using sensationalist and controversial tactics to improve their sales. As a result, the constant barrage of bad news has led to a society that sees itself as more vulnerable and powerless than ever. To make matters worse, there are plenty of well-documented instances where newspapers have been used to spread false propaganda which is usually politically motivated.All in all, although newspapers are our lifeline to the world around us, the recent trend of publishing misinformation has had a mostly negative impact on readers. It is my hope that newspapers will go back to publishing impartial accounts of the latest news in the future.;The role of newspapers in shaping public opinion is a widely acknowledged phenomenon, with many believing they have a profound impact on our perceptions. However, I argue that this influence is predominantly detrimental to our society. Historically, newspapers have served as a vital source of information, keeping the public informed about global events. Given the average person's limited expertise, reputable newspapers have significant sway over public opinion, leveraging attention-grabbing headlines and carefully crafted commentary to shape readers' views. Consequently, readers often have no choice but to accept the reported information at face value.Regrettably, the core principle of journalism - unbiased objectivity - appears to be fading. The rise of social media has led to a decline in print media subscriptions, as people increasingly turn to online platforms for news. In response, newspapers have resorted to sensationalist tactics to boost sales, resulting in a relentless stream of negative news that fosters a sense of vulnerability and powerlessness among the public. Furthermore, there have been numerous instances of newspapers disseminating politically motivated propaganda, which undermines trust in the media.In conclusion, while newspapers are a crucial link to global events, the recent trend of publishing misleading information has had a largely negative impact on readers. I hope that in the future, newspapers will revert to publishing balanced and impartial accounts of current events, thereby restoring their role as a trustworthy source of information.
1391;Nowadays environmental problems are too big to be managed by individual persons or individual countries. In other words, it is an international problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;An essential problem of the 21st century is world pollution. Currently the environment is so contaminated that urgent measures should be taken. A single individual cannot be blamed for the world pollution, however every person should take care of his or her habitat. In addition, it is vital that environmental issues are treated internationally.Lately, many presentations, conferences and international summits are held to deal with waste treatment, recycling, and soil and water contamination. joint efforts and consolidation can only help in the mutual war the ongoing environmental disaster. For instance, governments should offer support to companies and organizations, involved in manufacturing, industry or agriculture in order to find environment-friendly approaches. These could be special law regulations, recycling programs, helping courses in order to implement ISO certificates and many more.However, the influence of individuals over environment should not be ignored. If we do not that our planet is our home, we will never be able to take care of it. We have to contribute every day to the preservation of nature and environment. For example, always remember to save energy by switching off lamps, computers and everything that we do not use. Our next obligation is to separate waste and throw bulk only in the designated areas. Driving vehicles can also be environment friendly. For example, we have to avoid accelerating the engines too rapidly or using the air conditioning in the country, where it would be better to save energy and simply open the windows.To sum up, environmental problems should be handled by local and international authorities as well as individuals. Every single person should take care of the environment, moreover we have to bring up our children to be conscious citizens of a clean and preserved planet.;The 21st century is plagued by a critical issue: global pollution. The environment has reached a state of extreme contamination, necessitating immediate action. While no single individual can be held accountable for the world's pollution, it is essential that every person takes responsibility for their surroundings. Furthermore, it is crucial that environmental concerns are addressed on an international scale.Recently, numerous presentations, conferences, and global summits have been convened to tackle issues such as waste management, recycling, and soil and water pollution. Collaborative efforts and unified action are the only ways to combat the ongoing environmental crisis. For example, governments should provide support to companies and organizations involved in manufacturing, industry, and agriculture, enabling them to adopt eco-friendly practices. This can be achieved through special legislation, recycling programs, training courses to implement ISO certifications, and other initiatives.However, the impact of individuals on the environment should not be underestimated. If we fail to recognize that our planet is our home, we will never be able to protect it. It is our daily responsibility to contribute to the preservation of nature and the environment. Simple actions, such as switching off unused lamps, computers, and other devices to conserve energy, can make a significant difference. Additionally, we must separate waste and dispose of bulk items in designated areas. Even our driving habits can be environmentally friendly, such as avoiding rapid acceleration and using air conditioning sparingly, instead opting to save energy by opening windows.In conclusion, environmental problems require a dual approach, involving both local and international authorities, as well as individual efforts. Every person must take ownership of environmental conservation, and it is equally important to educate our children to become conscientious citizens of a clean and preserved planet. By working together, we can mitigate the environmental disaster and ensure a sustainable future.
1368;Nowadays families move to different countries for work and some think it has a negative effect on children (agree/disagree);Nowadays families move to different countries for work. Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Recent advancements, in technology and transportation in particular, are reshaping our world in an unprecedented manner. Nowadays, it is not unusual for people to work abroad. Most expatriates relocate their families to the countries . Some people argue that this phenomenon negatively affects children, however, I agree with those who believe the opposite is true.Those who think that relocating children to a new place is undesirable do so for many reasons. Their most common argument is the negative impact of moving on a child’s personality. There is no doubt that living in a different community comes with its challenges, especially to young people, as they get exposed to behaviours, actions and customs they might not be familiar with. As a result, children could possibly feel a lack of stability and some confusion. It is also likely that their patriotic feelings and sense of belonging to their home country could weaken as they would miss many opportunities to celebrate their national events.Nevertheless, I firmly believe that opinion to be ludicrous, as it seems that getting exposed to a new culture is beneficial in many ways. It fosters young social and emotional capabilities. Moreover, children living abroad have better opportunities to and practice new languages. Mastering more than one language improves not only their intellectual development, but also their opportunities in acquiring better jobs in the future. According to a recent study published by the University of Chicago, competency in more than one language increases employment chances on average by 200%.In conclusion, I strongly believe that living in a different country positively affects children in all aspects. Acquiring new languages, and an open minded and tolerant personality are just few examples of the many possible benefits.This essay presents a well‐developed position that addresses all parts of the task prompt. The writer’s ideas are relevant and well‐supported. The arrangement of information and use of cohesive devices are fine, perhaps with a slight overuse in the second body paragraph. Sentence structures are complex, and the vocabulary is varied and appropriately used, except for some minor grammatical/spelling mistakes. This essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;The modern world is witnessing a significant shift in the way people live and work, thanks to recent advancements in technology and transportation. It is now common for individuals to relocate to different countries for work, with many families following suit. While some people believe that this trend has a detrimental impact on children, others disagree. This essay will discuss both perspectives and provide my opinion on the matter.On the one hand, those who think that relocating children to a new country is undesirable argue that it can have a negative effect on their personality. They claim that adapting to a new community can be challenging, especially for young people, as they are exposed to unfamiliar behaviors, customs, and ways of life. This could lead to feelings of instability and confusion among children. Moreover, they may miss out on opportunities to celebrate national events and develop a sense of belonging to their home country, potentially weakening their patriotic feelings.On the other hand, I firmly believe that exposure to a new culture can be highly beneficial for children. It can foster their social and emotional development, as well as provide opportunities to learn and practice new languages. Mastering multiple languages can significantly improve their intellectual capabilities and increase their chances of securing better job opportunities in the future. According to a study by the University of Chicago, being proficient in more than one language can boost employment chances by an average of 200%. This suggests that the benefits of living abroad can have a long-lasting, positive impact on a child's life.In conclusion, I strongly believe that living in a different country can have a profoundly positive effect on children, encompassing benefits such as acquiring new languages, developing an open-minded and tolerant personality, and enhancing their career prospects. While there may be some challenges associated with relocating to a new country, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages, making it a valuable and enriching experience for children. 
1350;Nowadays many people choose ready-made food and refuse to cook at home, why and what are the advantages/disadvantages?;Nowadays many people choose ready-made food and refuse to cook at home. Why do you think it happens? What are the advantages and disadvantages of such a choice?It is a very popular practice in the modern society to order ready-made food from restaurants, rather than cooking at home. The main reasons for such a tendency may be cheap prices in some restaurants and people’s desire to save some time . Even though ordering food some obvious advantages, its disadvantages should not be underestimated.On the one hand, ordering prepared food may be the best choice for a busy person, who does not have time for cooking and cleaning. Cooking food at home requires a considerable amount of time, moreover the cleaning process may take even more time and resources than cooking itself. For example, cooking a simple dish such as chicken with rice home requires significant amounts of water and electricity for electrical appliances such as the oven and dishwasher. Hence, having an opportunity to order food from a restaurant will save a lot of time, electricity and water.On the other hand, delegating the process of cooking to some restaurant a dramatic disadvantage of not having the information about the ingredients used in the meals. With high demand, grow the volumes of required products, which sometimes can affect the quality of purchased produce. For example, it is a very common practice in some restaurants to make salads from products that are about to go bad and mask the rotten scent by adding some chemicals and spices. Hence, some restaurants may use poor quality products or chemicals for boosting taste and preservatives, which may have a negative effect on the customer’s health in the long run.In conclusion, ordering food from restaurants may be a tempting choice for people who have no time for cooking at home, but this approach has a critical disadvantage of being not informed about the ingredients used in the meal, which can have destructive consequences.This response covers the task requirements by giving a reason why people would choose to buy ready-made food and discussing the advantages and disadvantages of this trend.

A range of complex sentence forms and advanced vocabulary is used and there are very few instances of erroneous grammar or inaccurate expressions (see corrections underlined in blue). Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.;The trend of opting for ready-made food over home-cooked meals has become increasingly prevalent in modern society. But what drives this phenomenon, and what are the pros and cons of such a choice? In today's world, it's common for people to prefer ordering ready-made food from restaurants rather than cooking at home. The primary reasons behind this tendency could be the affordable prices offered by some restaurants and the desire to save time. Although ordering food has its obvious advantages, its disadvantages should not be overlooked.On the one hand, opting for prepared food can be the most convenient choice for busy individuals who lack the time for cooking and cleaning. Preparing meals at home requires a significant amount of time, and the cleaning process can be even more time-consuming and resource-intensive than cooking itself.

1316;Nowadays many teenagers have a celebrity who they follow as a role model. Some people think this is not a good idea, because celebrities often set a bad example. Do you agree or disagree?;It is not uncommon for teenagers to worship celebrities. From singers to actors, many young people around the world look up to these stars and attempt to emulate their lifestyles. In my opinion, allowing children to idolize celebrities can often be detrimental, as they frequently set a poor example.Many of today’s celebrities tend to lack moral values, and they promote behaviour inappropriate for young people. For instance, some music videos feature explicit lyrics glorifying drug use and violence. In addition, the media often reports on celebrities who indulge in excessive partying or drinking alcohol despite being underage. These types of headlines can have a negative influence on impressionable teens who might falsely believe that they should follow suit to appear cool or successful.Poor morals aren’t the only issue, as many popular stars are also well-known for their irresponsible spending habits. They routinely splurge on luxury items such as designer clothing or expensive cars without any consideration for budgeting or saving money responsibly. This kind of behaviour is dangerous because it is normalizing materialism and teaching teens that costly possessions will bring them happiness instead of focusing on what really matters in life: meaningful relationships, knowledge, and hard work.To conclude, young adults should keep in mind that society’s perception of fame and fortune is based on temporary, insubstantial things rather than what actually matters. In the grand scheme of things, it would be far more beneficial for teenagers to spend time developing their own set of values rooted in quality education and strong family relationships.;The phenomenon of teenagers idolizing celebrities is widespread. Many young people globally admire and try to mimic the lifestyles of famous singers, actors, and other public figures. However, I believe that allowing children to idolize celebrities can be harmful, as they often set a bad example. A significant number of today's celebrities lack strong moral values and promote behavior that is unsuitable for young people. For example, some music videos contain explicit language that glorifies substance abuse and violence. Furthermore, the media frequently reports on celebrities who engage in excessive partying or underage drinking, creating headlines that can negatively influence impressionable teenagers. These young people may mistakenly believe that they need to emulate this behavior to fit in or appear successful.Moreover, poor morals are not the only concern, as many popular celebrities are also known for their irresponsible financial habits. They frequently overspend on luxury items like designer clothing or expensive cars without considering budgeting or responsible saving. This behavior is problematic because it promotes materialism and teaches teenagers that expensive possessions are the key to happiness, rather than emphasizing the importance of meaningful relationships, knowledge, and hard work.In conclusion, young adults should be aware that society's perception of fame and wealth is based on fleeting, superficial things rather than what truly matters. In the larger context, it would be more beneficial for teenagers to focus on developing their own values, rooted in a quality education and strong family relationships. By doing so, they can cultivate a more meaningful and lasting sense of purpose and happiness.

701;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. In this essay, the reason for wasting food and the acts which can be done by humans to reduce the amount of food one throws away will be thorougly discussed.Firstly, people waste food as one tends to be satisfied with the amount one eats. Thus, people order food more than one can eat as one can not estimate the amount of food. The amount of food one person can consume differs on one's conditions at that moment. The conditions include mood, physical features and activities one did on that particular day. Furthermore, one wants to taste all sorts of food, however, one can not eat all of those. Sometimes, people order food which are well decorated just to take a photo of it and upload it on social media such as Instagram. After taking photo, people just leave the food. The above mentioned reasons can be the causes of wastage of food.Apparently, people can reduce the amount of food they throw away. The restaurants can provide more informations about the amount and taste briefly to avoid the situation that consumers can not finish the food and are dissatisfied with the taste or smell. Moreover, consumers have to make a wise decision so that they do not waste both food and money. People should co-operate to reduce the wastage of food as it causes pollution on land. It leads to bad smell and brings insects to the areas.Conclusively, it is quite clear that people greatly waste food and there are a few ways for people to follow so as to reduce the amount of waste food.;In today's society, a significant amount of food is wasted, having been purchased from shops and restaurants. This essay aims to thoroughly discuss the reasons behind food waste and the actions individuals can take to minimize the amount of food they discard.One primary reason for food waste is that people tend to overestimate their appetites. As a result, they often order more food than they can consume, as their hunger and capacity to eat can vary greatly depending on factors such as their mood, physical condition, and activities undertaken on a given day. Additionally, the desire to sample a variety of dishes can lead to ordering excessive amounts of food, which ultimately goes to waste. Some individuals even order food solely for the purpose of taking a photo to post on social media platforms like Instagram, only to abandon the food after capturing the image. These factors all contribute to the significant waste of food.However, there are steps that can be taken to reduce food waste. Restaurants can provide detailed information about portion sizes and flavors to help consumers make informed decisions, avoiding dissatisfaction with their meals and reducing the likelihood of unfinished food. Moreover, consumers must make wise choices to avoid wasting both food and money. It is essential that people work together to minimize food waste, as it contributes to pollution, unpleasant odors, and attracts insects to affected areas.In conclusion, it is evident that food waste is a substantial issue, and there are several strategies that individuals can adopt to reduce the amount of food waste. By making conscious choices and working collectively, people can significantly decrease the volume of discarded food and mitigate its detrimental environmental impacts.
1354;Nowadays people waste a lot of food, why is this happening and how to reduce waste?;Nowadays people waste a lot of food that was bought from shops and restaurants. Why do you think people waste food? What can be done to reduce the amount of food they throw away?At the time when famines heavily strike impoverished third world countries, many people living in wealthy countries waste tremendous amounts of food daily. In my opinion, understanding the probable reasons of this phenomenon is important and may lead us to some applicable solutions that will result in reducing food waste.The low cost of food seems to be one of the obvious reasons, exacerbating the problem. Due to the revolutionary technological achievements, people have increased both the quality and the quantity of their crops. In turn, according to the laws of supply and demand, the prices of the crops have immensely dropped. A recent study of the FAO stated that the global crops prices have dropped 50 per cent over the last decade. This enabled people to buy excessive amounts of food without a real need.Furthermore, the absence of strict regulations to discourage or punish this attitude can also be considered a major cause. Not everyone is aware that wasting food may create problems. Consequently, they are likely to resist any calls for controlling the consumption of dietary supplies unless they are forced by the power of law. Several countries in the world saw a drop in their national food waste after implementing a ban on the excessive purchasing of food.Fortunately, there are some possible approaches that can be adopted by both people and governments. Firstly, raising the awareness of this issue is immensely important. Using social media platforms can draw public attention to the potential dangers of food waste and how communities can confront it. Secondly, enforcing laws that prohibit the wasting of food by people and companies will deter such harmful practice.In conclusion, the decreased price of food as well as lack of regulations allowed the unfortunate trend of throwing away food to continue. I believe that creating awareness and legislation are parts of a straightforward solution to this issue.The writer explored the reasons for throwing away food and suggested some solutions, effortlessly conveying his/her ideas in this well-written IELTS essay. The information is presented in an orderly, logical and coherent way. A wide range of vocabulary is used in this written response. The sentence structures are varied and the vocabulary is impressive.

1351;Nowadays that many women have full time jobs, it is logical to share the housework evenly between men and women (agree/disagree);Nowadays in many countries women have full time jobs. Therefore, it is logical to share household tasks evenly between men and women. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Nowadays an ever-increasing number of women work full time, and in this reality it is widely believed that house chores should be shared between men and women equally. I strongly agree with this statement.One of the reasons for sharing housework between is to promote gender equality. A stereotype that has existed a long time is that females ought to stay home, taking care of the family once they got married. This includes looking after the children and doing all of the housework, which is fairly labour-intensive. However, this approach could have quite a few disadvantages. It would render women less able of keeping abreast of what is happening in the job market, thus forming a lifestyle where they might find it arduous to step into the society again. To avoid this, many women are willing to get back into the workforce soon after their maternity leave, and once they do, it makes sense that their husbands should share part of the household chores, to fulfill their family responsibilities.Nevertheless, we cannot be oblivious several drawbacks of this trend. One potential downside is that men are less experienced in dealing with household tasks. This is because many seldom take an active role in doing housework, according to customs of many countries. As a result, they may end up doing household tasks in a less than perfect way, which could contribute to some unnecessary quarrels between partners, hindering their family bond. However, the likelihood of this happening isn’t very high, because wives can offer some tips or guidance to their husbands when they learn how to share house chores such as mopping floors or doing laundry.To sum up, although some conflicts might be triggered when equally sharing the duties of household tasks, the benefits of this trend are relatively oblivious.The writer covered the task well by discussing the positives and negatives of sharing housework equally between men and women. Each paragraph has a clear purpose and assists with orderly presentation of ideas, making this essay easy to follow. The ideas are explained and substantiated, and the writer’s opinion is clear.

25;Nowadays, not enough students choose science subjects in university in many countries. What are the reasons for this problem? What are the effects on society?;"It is a serious problem that there is an inadequate number of students who tend to select science as their major subject in universities in many countries. In my view, students may think that studying science has not a good career path. Also, this issue may deeply affect the international state of a country.The main reason why people do not think to study science is that they may see science as something unpractical, and potentially, they are hard to find a job when they graduate. Students are generally afraid that there is no employment opportunity after they graduate from university. Unlike engineering and business management, in which fields employers provide plenty of vocational positions for graduated students because there are lots of companies activating in these fields and universities may provide some practical training courses and internships. Students studying science have a relatively narrow way to walk, and may just be scientists. Moreover, although a successful scientist can get a massive bonus from some prizes, it is too hard to accomplish and is more likely to fail. Therefore, Students will avoid taking those risks and choose other subjects that are relatively stable and easy to find a job.This trend will eventually decrease the state of a country. Developing science can provide a strong and firm foundation for a country to establish a healthy and prosperous community. If there are not enough scientists, the whole scientific ability will decrease. Not only will the government pay extra money to other foreign countries to buy the required technology such as military equipment, but the public needs to spend more time and pay more effort to maintain the international standard production rate of a country. It is extremely dangerous that a nation easily suffers from a financial crisis and, finally, it influences the living standard of its citizens and causes damage to its financial systems.In summary, while science is regarded as a ""useless"" subject because of its narrow career path and low success rate, it is vital that the economic systems would be affected if a country develop without scientists.";"The lack of students pursuing science as a major in universities is a pressing issue in many countries. In my opinion, this can be attributed to the perception that studying science does not lead to a promising career path. Furthermore, this trend has significant implications for a country's international standing.The primary reason students are deterred from studying science is that it is often viewed as impractical, making it challenging to secure employment after graduation. Unlike fields such as engineering and business management, which offer numerous job opportunities and practical training, science students face a more limited and uncertain career trajectory. The prospect of becoming a scientist is daunting, and although successful scientists can reap significant rewards, the likelihood of failure is high. As a result, students tend to opt for more stable and secure subjects.This trend has far-reaching consequences, ultimately affecting a country's overall development. A strong scientific foundation is essential for establishing a thriving and healthy community. Without sufficient scientists, a country's scientific capabilities will decline, forcing the government to rely on foreign technologies, such as military equipment, and spend more resources to maintain international production standards. This vulnerability to financial crises can have a devastating impact on a nation's living standards and financial systems.In conclusion, while science may be perceived as a ""useless"" subject due to its narrow career prospects and low success rates, it is crucial to recognize the significant economic implications of a country developing without a strong scientific workforce. The consequences of neglecting science education can have severe and long-lasting effects on a nation's prosperity and stability."

Rather, students should seize the opportunity to gain new experiences, expand their knowledge, and develop a greater understanding of themselves and the world around them. By doing so, they will be better equipped to navigate the complexities of life and make a positive impact in their chosen fields.

Furthermore, insufficient electricity and funding for essential services exacerbate these problems.To mitigate these issues, governments can take proactive steps by implementing effective laws and regulations to enhance public safety and happiness. Providing adequate funding to sanitary boards can help reduce water stagnation during rainy seasons. Investing in research and development can lead to innovative solutions to combat air and water pollution, ultimately improving the health and well-being of local residents.Alternatively, governments can consider developing nearby towns with modern amenities, such as housing, educational institutions, good roads, and sanitation facilities. By doing so, people may be encouraged to relocate to smaller towns, which can help alleviate the pressure on major cities and mitigate the pressing issues they face. For instance, Delhi, the capital of India, is struggling with severe air pollution and security concerns due to its massive population. Research suggests that reducing the population density could help alleviate these problems.Some experts propose that adopting new technologies or structures inspired by successful cities worldwide could be a viable solution. Personally, I believe that this approach could be beneficial if implemented effectively by the government. However, weighing the positive and negative impacts of each option makes it challenging to conclude which solution would be most effective in resolving the issues plaguing major cities.
645;People often think about creating an ideal society, but most of the times fail in making this happen.What is your opinion about an ideal societyHow can we create an ideal society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"One of the ambition of the people is to create a harmonious community to live in. Unfortunately, individuals often fail to create one. This essay will discuss what is an ideal society, as well as ways on how to make it happen.An ideal community is a place where peace of mind over shadows fear. We all now that everyone wants a place that is criminal free. For example, people can just walk in an aisle without thinking of being raped or kidnapped. Moreover, it is a community in which discrimination, prejudice and racism is prohibited. In short, everyone is treated equally regardless of gender, colors, religions, social status, jobs and looks. It also means that, people can just walk in and out of a hospital or establishments without being looked down or degraded by other people especially those with high status.However, it is difficult for people to meet this kind of standards. This mainly because nobody is made perfect and as a human being we are mostly dominated by hatred, jealousy and selfishness. Although people fail to have a perfect society, there are some ways on how to have a near perfect place to live. First of all, government should make the lives of the people a better one by being an active role model to the citizens. There should not be corruption involve amongst the higher ups. Also, as what the saying goes ""learning should start at home"", it means that, parents should the take the initiative to educate their children proper manners in dealing with other people. In Japan, children were taught in a very young age on how to treat other people. That is why they always bow down their head as a sign of respect.To conclude, creating an essential environment can be challenging and demanding for all of us. Eventhough, it is impossible to make, each one of us can has the capacity to contribute to make society an almost perfect one.";"One of the greatest aspirations of humanity is to create a harmonious community where people can live in peace and prosperity. Unfortunately, individuals often struggle to achieve this ideal. This essay will explore what constitutes an ideal society and discuss ways to make it a reality.An ideal community is a place where peace of mind prevails over fear. Everyone desires a community that is free from crime, where people can walk safely without worrying about being harmed or victimized. Moreover, it is a community that prohibits discrimination, prejudice, and racism, where everyone is treated with equal respect and dignity regardless of their gender, race, religion, social status, occupation, or physical appearance. This means that people can access hospitals, establishments, and public spaces without being judged or discriminated against by others, especially those in positions of power.However, achieving this ideal is challenging because humans are imperfect and often driven by negative emotions such as hatred, jealousy, and selfishness. Although creating a perfect society may be impossible, there are ways to create a near-perfect community. Firstly, the government should set a positive example for its citizens by promoting transparency and accountability, and eliminating corruption among its officials. As the saying goes, ""learning starts at home,"" and parents should take the initiative to teach their children good manners, respect, and empathy towards others. In some cultures, such as Japan, children are taught from a young age to respect others, which is reflected in their customs and traditions, such as bowing as a sign of respect.In conclusion, creating an ideal environment is a challenging and demanding task for all of us. Nevertheless, each one of us has the capacity to contribute to making society a better place, and although achieving perfection may be impossible, we can strive to create a community that is as close to ideal as possible."
1326;People should follow the local customs and traditions, when they come to live in a new country. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"The globalised world these days makes it simpler than ever before for people to relocate and start building a life in a new country. As everyone comes from their own cultural background, a question arises of whether or not people should be expected to follow the customs of their host country. I completely agree with the view that while learning about the local customs may require some time and effort, it is valuable and will aid the integration of the newcomers into society.In many cultures following the local customs means showing respect, which is an important moral value in nearly every culture. The opposite is also true: disregarding traditions is often seen as a sign of disrespect. In order to establish good neighbourly relationships and feel welcome in the new place, it is important to demonstrate the effort to become part of the community. By expressing an interest in learning traditions, new arrivals gain a chance to interact with their neighbours and colleagues, get to know them and build some connections in the new country.Another positive aspect is the enhanced feeling of belonging that people get from participating in activities others around them are doing. When a national festival is in full swing, standing on the sidelines might make people feel excluded and perhaps even homesick, whereas joining others opens up opportunities to attend special events together, go to parties, meet new people and feel part of the celebrations. In Australia, for example, Easter is a very special time of the year and some of the traditional activities include Easter egg decoration and gifting, and baking hot cross buns; sharing your designs and recipes with others is an excellent conversation starter.In conclusion, learning the customs and traditions of one’s new country doesn’t mean a loss of their own culture. On the contrary, it is an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of cultural connections and should be embraced as a positive experience.";In today's globalized world, relocating to a new country has become easier than ever. As individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds migrate, the question arises whether they should adopt the customs of their host country. I firmly believe that learning about local customs, although requiring time and effort, is invaluable and facilitates the integration of newcomers into society.Respecting local customs is a universal moral value, essential in nearly every culture, as it demonstrates consideration and appreciation for the host country's traditions. Conversely, disregarding these customs can be perceived as disrespectful. To establish harmonious relationships with neighbors and feel welcomed, it is crucial to show a willingness to become part of the community. By expressing interest in local traditions, new arrivals can interact with their neighbors and colleagues, build connections, and get acquainted with their new surroundings.Participating in local activities also enhances the sense of belonging, allowing individuals to feel more connected to their new community. During national festivals, joining in the celebrations provides opportunities to attend events, parties, and meet new people, thereby fostering a sense of inclusion. For instance, in Australia, Easter is a significant time of the year, marked by traditions such as Easter egg decoration and hot cross bun baking. Sharing these experiences with others can serve as an excellent conversation starter, helping to break the ice and build relationships.In conclusion, embracing the customs and traditions of a new country does not imply a loss of one's own cultural identity. Rather, it offers a chance to gain a deeper understanding of cultural connections, making it a positive experience that should be embraced. By learning and respecting local customs, individuals can navigate their new environment with greater ease, build meaningful relationships, and ultimately, feel more at home in their adopted country.
1370;People should not work beyond the retirement age (agree/disagree);Some believe that people should not continue to work once they reach the age of retirement. Do you agree or disagree? Give reasons for your answer and include relevant examples from your experience.In recent years, with the improvement in healthcare sector and better , people are able to live longer and contribute to the economic progress of a nation more, compared to the past. Some see this as an entirely positive development, while others point out the drawbacks of working beyond the retirement age.Delaying retirement enables individuals to actively contribute to the society. On a personal level, working past retirement age provides an avenue for individuals to remain not only physically but also mentally active. Moreover, this option empowers the ageing population to be financially independent and economically self-sustainable past retirement age. In countries with growing ageing population such as Singapore, for instance, citizens are given an option to work beyond their retirement age based on the demands of their job and their capability to handle these tasks. Hence, working beyond retirement age empowers workers, ensures economic progression of the nation, and alleviates the challenges faced by an ageing population.On the flip side, working beyond the retirement age may result in adverse health impacts on workers and a decrease in productivity levels.

709;People think that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. Others believe that there are other alternative solutions for reducing crime.Discuss both views and give your opinion on this topic.;"Nowadays the sentences that judges give to criminals is always at the centre of attention of the society; some people think that the best way to reduce the amount of crime cases is to give longer prison sentences, while, others say that there are other alternative ways to stop it. This essay will talk about both views and, at the end, I will give my opinion about the argument.It is always more common to see long sentences for criminals, also if their crimes are not too bad to deserve that type of punishment; the reason why the court gives to them long sentences is because they think that staying a lot in prison will make the criminals understand that what they did is wrong and, next time, they will think twice before doing something bad or against the law.However long sentences can go against the human rights because they will take away from prisoners years of their life; for this reason, some people think that it can be better if, instead of stay close in a jail without doing nothing, they can be used in various works that will make them useful for the society and better person at the end of the sentence, like cleaning the city, helping old people in retirement homes and also cook for poor people.I think that there are other ways to stop crime instead of giving long punishments, also because everyone should have a second chance in their life and, more importantly, teach and show to prisoners different aspects of the community will help cities to become better places with less crimes to stop.This essay talked about two different types of views about crime sentences in our society, with my own opinion about the argument in the last part of it.";In recent years, the sentences handed down to criminals by judges have been at the forefront of societal attention. While some people believe that longer prison sentences are the most effective way to reduce crime rates, others argue that alternative methods can be more successful. This essay will examine both perspectives and conclude with my personal opinion on the matter.It is common to see criminals receiving lengthy prison sentences, even for relatively minor offenses. The reasoning behind these long sentences is that the court believes that a prolonged prison stay will help criminals realize the error of their ways and think twice before committing another crime. However, this approach can be seen as a violation of human rights, as it takes away years of a person's life.Some argue that instead of keeping prisoners idle in jail, it would be more beneficial to engage them in community service work that makes them useful to society and helps them become better individuals. Examples of such work include cleaning the city, assisting the elderly in retirement homes, and cooking for those in need. By giving prisoners a sense of purpose and teaching them about different aspects of the community, cities can become better places with lower crime rates.In my opinion, there are more effective ways to combat crime than simply imposing long sentences. Everyone deserves a second chance, and by teaching prisoners about the community and providing them with useful skills, we can create a more positive and crime-free society. This essay has presented two differing views on crime sentencing, with my own perspective on the issue.
1286;People today find their lives more and more dominated by their jobs. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is certainly true that many people around the world find their lives dominated by the work that they have to do. This is shown when you realise how people’s work, and how much time, effort and resources they devote to it, is often the subject of conversation.Most people depend on their jobs to generate an income to pay for their lives’ necessities and luxuries, and so work can naturally become a dominating focus. As this is an important part of nearly everyone’s everyday life, it can seem that people’s lives are indeed becoming more influenced by their jobs. Whether this emphasis on work is more significant now than in previous years is debatable. In many developed countries around the world, there are procedures in place to help people with finding work, providing unemployment benefits, ensuring education, and offering pension payments. In times past, these provisions were not in place and a job or business was required to provide the necessary income.Therefore, in spite of increases in the cost of living in many places around the world, it can be argued there is actually less pressure than in previous years to keep one’s job and perform well at it. This, in turn, would lead to people’s lives being less influenced by their jobs today. It is also true that in the past, people were as responsible and focused on doing well in their responsibilities as today and so, in this respect, the people of the past would be equally dedicated to their work as people are today.While I agree that people’s lives today are often dominated by their jobs, I feel that the current situation is not necessarily worse than before. In fact, it may be more positive, due to the fewer pressures to earn money in many countries.;It's undeniable that for many individuals worldwide, their profession plays a significant role in shaping their lives. This is evident in the way work-related topics frequently become the centerpiece of conversations, with people dedicating substantial time, effort, and resources to their jobs. The primary reason for this intense focus on work stems from its role as the main source of income, essential for covering both the necessities and luxuries of life. Given the integral part that work plays in daily life, it's reasonable to conclude that professional responsibilities significantly influence people's lives. However, whether this work-centric mentality is more pronounced now than in the past is a matter of debate.In many developed nations, various support systems are in place to facilitate employment, including unemployment benefits, educational resources, and pension plans. These provisions were largely absent in the past, making the pursuit of a job or establishment of a business a necessity for survival. Despite the rising cost of living in numerous parts of the world, one could argue that there's actually less pressure to retain employment and perform exceptionally, compared to previous eras. This reduced pressure could imply that, paradoxically, people's lives might be less dominated by their work today.Moreover, historical contexts suggest that people have always been diligent and committed to their responsibilities, similar to contemporary work ethics. This dedication to professional duties has remained a constant, suggesting that the degree of dedication to work has not necessarily increased, but rather, the nature and perception of work have evolved.While acknowledging the significant impact of work on people's lives today, I propose that the current situation may not be as bleak as it's often portrayed. In fact, considering the reduced financial pressures in many countries, the situation might even be viewed as more favorable. The availability of social safety nets and educational opportunities in developed countries has likely alleviated some of the pressures associated with job security and performance, potentially leading to a more balanced approach to work and life.
1264;Percentage of UK people who consumed daily recommended amount of fruit and vegetable in 2002, 2006 and 2010.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar graph compares the proportion of UK citizens in terms of their consumption of daily recommended portions of fruits and vegetables in three different years which are 2002, 2006, and 2010.Overall, females consumed the highest percentage of their recommended healthy food, followed by males, and last are the children.additionally the year 2006 had witnessed the vastest consumption of vegetables and fruits among all given years.Women ate exactly 25% of the daily adviced dose of natural food in the year 2002, 32% in 2006, and 26% in 2010, however men took 22% of the recommended dose in the year 2002, 26% in 2006, and 24% in 2010.On the other hand younger individuals only consumed 11%, 18%, and 16% of the daily requirements of veggies and fruits in the years 2002, 2006, and 2010 respectively. It appears that residents of the UK had eaten the highest daily requirements of greens and fruits in the year 2006 as compared to the years 2006 and 2010.;The bar graph illustrates the proportion of UK citizens consuming their daily recommended portions of fruits and vegetables over three years: 2002, 2006, and 2010.

The data shows that women consumed 25% of the recommended daily intake of fruits and vegetables in 2002, 32% in 2006, and 26% in 2010. In contrast, men consumed 22% of the recommended daily intake in 2002, 26% in 2006, and 24% in 2010. Children had the lowest consumption rates, with 11% of the daily recommended intake in 2002, 18% in 2006, and 16% in 2010. Overall, it appears that UK residents consumed the highest amount of fruits and vegetables in 2006 compared to the other two years. 
1402;Popular events like the football world cup and other international sporting occasions are essential in easing international tensions and releasing patriotic emotions in a safe way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;The World Cup football and the Olympics are held worldwide with great national support and expectations. As a fan of those competitions, I agree with the idea that sporting events can be necessary for international relations and national unity, but only partially, because such events can have unintended effects on relationships between countries.First of all, the World Cup, Olympics and other international games work for easing tensions among different nations. For example, South and North Korea have football games regularly two nations a chance to understand each other . In the mid of North Korean supporters came to South Korea with the footballers and they were very excited during the sporting events. Even if it sounds ridiculous, many South Koreans were quite surprised at that moment when North Koreans shouted and cried during the match. We all realized that they were very normal sports fans even though they were occasionally very secretive. Through the sports, two divided nations could reduce their political and ideological tensions and could feel the patriotic unity.On the other hand, some sports matches can make international relations worse. For instance, football or baseball games between Korea and Japan are always big matches in two countries where . Sometimes, after the matches, the two rivals blame each other and their patriotic emotions explode in an aggressive way. scenario is that the troubles caused by losing games affect the players directly.;The FIFA World Cup and the Olympic Games are global events that garner immense national support and enthusiasm. As an avid fan of these competitions, I partially concur with the notion that sporting events play a crucial role in fostering international relations and national unity. However, I also acknowledge that these events can have unintended consequences on the relationships between nations.On the one hand, international sporting events like the World Cup and the Olympics can help alleviate tensions between countries. A notable example is the regular football matches between South and North Korea, which provide an opportunity for the two nations to engage with each other. During one such event, North Korean supporters traveled to South Korea with their football team, and their excitement and emotional display during the match surprised many South Koreans. This experience humanized the North Korean fans, revealing that they are ordinary sports enthusiasts despite their country's secretive nature. Through sports, the two divided nations can reduce their political and ideological differences and experience a sense of patriotic unity.On the other hand, certain sports matches can exacerbate international relations. For instance, football or baseball games between Korea and Japan are highly anticipated and emotionally charged events in both countries. The rivalry between the two teams can sometimes lead to blaming and aggressive outbursts after matches, fueled by patriotic emotions. Furthermore, the repercussions of losing a game can directly impact the players, creating an additional layer of tension. This highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of sporting events in shaping international relations, where the outcomes can be both positive and negative.
913;Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:In the past, sporting champions used to be motivated primarily by the desire to win a match or to break world records. These days they are more likely to be motivated by prize money and the opportunity to be famous.What message does this send to young people and how does this attitude to sport affect the sports themselves?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;There were many sport competitions organized after the World-War II since the first Olympic games was held in Athena, in 1963, to bring the world together again. Previously, sport competition was seen as an opportunity for the athletes to break the world records for the pride of their home countries. However, nowadays, people are more inclined to win the match because of money reward and glory. I believe that young people should be more encouraged to achieve their goals to become a champion so that the value of sport competition would not be purely for commercial purpose.In the last decades, there have been a lot of sport competitions being held from national to global level. The athletes were trained by the supported teams to do their best to become the world champion. It was the pride of such athlete to win and see their national flags were rised after the match. Over the years, sport has become more commercial following its popularity to attract global audiences. Many athletes are paying more attention for the opportunity to win the match for commercial purpose. For example, one wants to become a famous soccer player so that they could become the ambassador of Adidas and get more income out of it.Due to the temptation for getting famous and having more money, there are people who choose to play unfairly during a competition. Instead of focusing on increasing their skills, they would cheat to win the game for money. For example, a soccer player may use thyroid injection for boosting their energy level even though it is strictly prohibited. Moreover, sport is not seen anymore to promote peace and solidarity among people from different cultural backgrounds but for the chance to get the superficial gloriness.To conclude, even if the motivation has shifted, the young people should learn to focus more on becoming a real champion and play fairly so that they can become the best athletes in thier expertise while the money and glory would follow them after.;In the aftermath of World War II, numerous sports competitions were organized to reunite the world. The first Olympic Games, held in Athens in 1964 (not 1963, as the first modern Olympic Games actually took place in Athens in 1896), set the stage for international athletic events. Initially, sports competitions were seen as a platform for athletes to break records and bring pride to their home countries. However, nowadays, the motivation has shifted, and many athletes are more focused on winning for the sake of monetary rewards and fame.Over the past few decades, sports competitions have proliferated at both national and global levels. Athletes, supported by their teams, strive to become world champions, with the pride of winning and seeing their national flags raised being a paramount goal. As sports have gained immense popularity, they have also become increasingly commercialized, attracting global audiences and lucrative sponsorship deals. Many athletes are now drawn to the prospect of winning for financial gain, with some aspiring to become brand ambassadors, such as representing Adidas, to boost their income.The lure of fame and wealth has led some individuals to engage in unfair practices during competitions. Instead of concentrating on honing their skills, they resort to cheating to win, often for financial gain. For instance, a soccer player might use performance-enhancing substances, like thyroid injections, which are strictly prohibited. Unfortunately, sports are no longer solely seen as a means to promote peace, solidarity, and cultural exchange among people from diverse backgrounds, but rather as an opportunity to attain fleeting glory and superficial success.In conclusion, despite the shift in motivation, it is essential for young athletes to focus on becoming true champions, prioritizing fair play and skill development. By doing so, they can become the best in their respective fields, and the rewards, including monetary gains and recognition, will follow naturally. It is crucial to encourage young people to strive for excellence and uphold the values of sportsmanship, ensuring that the essence of sports competitions remains pure and untainted by commercialism.
903;Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:Some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by giving them extra money. This practice can act as an incentive for some but may also have a negative impact on others.To what extent is this style of management effective?Are there better ways of encouraging employees to work hard?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Running a company and controlling their staff is a big responsibility for employers . In general, employers should have a great vision about the future of their own company and how to improve it in a better way .To start with, some employers reward members of staff for their exceptional contribution to the company by simply giving them more many. In addition, that practice can act as a good source of motivation, you can see that your hard work and your extra hours wasn't waste after all .On the other hand, this style of management may affect tha company and their community in a negative way . For example, the manager of the institution may be more focused on just one employee who's always have the extra credit for the work therefore the other employees work hard for nothing and that leave a bad idea that they clearly work for just having that extra money and rewards from the manager .Beside that, employees will be affected and their productivity will change and drop even more and all of that is a result on how the management of a company impact their work and their effort of doing more .To sum it up, all the members in that company worked so hard, a little credit for their effort and long hours of developing their company and rewards them for it won't do any harm . Not to mention, a manager can reward the staff of the institution by giving them a day or two off or basically a three hours break . Anything that make them really satisfied after their long and efficient work towards the developing of the company.;Managing a company and overseeing its staff is a significant responsibility for employers. To be effective, employers should have a clear and compelling vision for their company's future and a well-thought-out plan for improvement.One way to motivate staff is to recognize and reward exceptional performance. By providing monetary incentives, employers can demonstrate that hard work and extra effort are valued and appreciated. This approach can be a powerful motivator, as employees can see that their dedication and long hours are not going to waste.However, this management style can have negative consequences for the company and its community. For instance, if a manager focuses too much on a single high-performing employee, others may feel underappreciated and unmotivated, leading to a decline in productivity and a sense of disillusionment. When employees feel that their hard work is not recognized or valued, they may become disengaged and less committed to the company's success.In contrast, acknowledging and rewarding employees' efforts can have a profoundly positive impact. Recognizing their contributions, whether through monetary rewards, time off, or other benefits, can boost morale, motivation, and overall job satisfaction. Even small gestures, such as a day or two off or a extended break, can make a significant difference in employees' perception of their work and their commitment to the company's goals. By showing appreciation for their staff's hard work and dedication, employers can foster a positive and productive work environment.
897;Present a written argument or case to an educated non-specialist audience on the following topic:Under British and Australian laws a jury in a criminal case has no access to information about the defendant's past criminal record. This protects the person who is being accused of the crime.Some lawyers have suggested that this practice should be changed and that a jury should be given all the past facts before they reach their decision about the case.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In the UK and Australia, a jury is not provided with the defendant's previous criminal history. Some law representatives claim that this should be reverted, and the jury must be provided with this information beforehand. I fully agree with this statement since the jury will have a better understanding of the defendant's behaviour, and the final decision will be easier to understand for the audience.Having the jury the right access to the defendant's past criminal background, would provide the jury with enough information about the defendant's behaviour. This is because there are certain previous criminal behavioural patterns which allow a better profesional decision-making from the part of the jury. For example, a recent study of the Law's Practice of Melboune, has shown that around 77% of people who commit a crime, were involved in at least one criminal event in the past with similar characteristics to the current crime.On the other hand, if the jury has access to the defendant's past criminal history, it would be easier for the audience to understand the nature of the jury's final decision. This is because there have been cases in which the jury's final decision was not completely accepted by the audience or misunderstood. Therefore, providing the jury with enough criminal backgroud records of the defendant will make it clear to understand in beased of what or why the jury's final decision was made.In conclusion, in the UK and Australia, a jury does not have access to a defendant's previous criminal records, and some law representatives claim that this should be reverted. I fully agree with this statement since being provided with this documents will allow the jury a more understanding of the defendant's behaviour, and the final jury's decision will be easier to understand for the audience.;In the UK and Australia, juries are not informed about a defendant's prior criminal history. However, some legal representatives argue that this policy should be reversed, and juries should have access to this information before reaching a verdict. I strongly support this view, as it would enable juries to better comprehend the defendant's behavior and make their final decision more understandable to the public.Providing juries with access to a defendant's past criminal record would equip them with sufficient information to make informed decisions about the defendant's behavior. This is because previous criminal patterns can inform the jury's decision-making process. For instance, a recent study by the Melbourne Law School found that approximately 77% of individuals who commit crimes have a history of similar offenses, highlighting the importance of considering past behavior when evaluating a defendant's actions.Moreover, if juries are aware of a defendant's past criminal history, it would facilitate public understanding of their verdicts. There have been cases where the jury's decision was met with skepticism or confusion by the public, underscoring the need for transparency. By providing juries with a defendant's criminal background, the rationale behind their decisions would be more apparent, making it easier for the public to understand the basis for the verdict.In conclusion, the current practice in the UK and Australia of withholding a defendant's prior criminal records from juries is a subject of debate, with some legal experts advocating for a change in policy. I firmly agree with this perspective, as accessing these records would enhance the jury's understanding of the defendant's behavior and render their decisions more intelligible to the public.
1308;Professional sportsmen and sportswomen and professional entertainers can often command enormous salaries today and this situation reflects society’s dependence on being entertained.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is no secret that today’s entertainment industry is extremely popular, with nearly everyone being engaged at some time in watching TV shows, movies and sports games. The North American sports industry alone generates a massive $67.7 billion every year. With the present emphasis on entertainment, sportsmen and women and professional entertainers can earn enormous salaries, with figures in the millions for one game, appearance or film. This situation certainly does reflect today’s society’s obsession with entertainment.Many people argue that celebrities do not deserve such payment when work in other professions considered of equal or higher value to society is underpaid. A-list celebrities can make over $20 million per movie, whilst many average workers can barely make ends meet. Of course there are lots of people who say that there are better ways the money could be used, rather than allowing such a vast amount to go to just one person. This is a fairly naive point of view, though. So long as people wish to watch entertainment, advertising in turn will be present and the most watched celebrities will be able to earn high salaries, as their presence will ensure the high viewing figures the advertisers desire.Though celebrities and sportsmen and sportswomen often make very large sums of money, it can also be seen as unfair to say that they do not deserve it or propose their money be used for something else. While it is true that they did not find a cure for cancer or made a life-changing scientific discovery, their hard work and expertise created a product that the public wants to see and the high payment merely reflects their value.In conclusion, it is clear that today’s society is indeed a society obsessed with being entertained and the high salaries paid to those who entertain society clearly reflect this. The high payments, however, are not necessarily out of place or undeserved.;The entertainment industry has become an integral part of modern life, with a vast majority of people engaging with TV shows, movies, and sports games at some point. The North American sports industry alone generates a staggering $67.7 billion annually. As a result, sports professionals and entertainers can command enormous salaries, with some earning millions for a single game, appearance, or film. This phenomenon is a testament to society's obsession with entertainment. Many critics argue that celebrities' hefty paychecks are undeserved, especially when compared to the modest salaries of professionals in other fields who contribute equally or more to society. The disparity is striking, with A-list celebrities earning over $20 million per movie, while average workers struggle to make ends meet. Some suggest that this money could be better spent, rather than concentrating it in the hands of a single individual. However, this perspective overlooks the fact that as long as there is a demand for entertainment, advertisers will continue to invest, and popular celebrities will be able to command high salaries due to their ability to attract large audiences.While it is true that celebrities and sports personalities earn substantial amounts, it is unfair to say they do not deserve their compensation or suggest that their money would be better spent elsewhere. Although they may not have made groundbreaking scientific discoveries or medical breakthroughs, their expertise and hard work have created a product that the public desires, and their high earnings reflect their value to society.In conclusion, it is evident that today's society is deeply invested in entertainment, and the high salaries of those in the entertainment industry are a reflection of this. Rather than being excessive or undeserved, these high payments are a natural consequence of the significant value that these individuals bring to society.
1311;Providing a national system in a country where the unemployed receive a regular payment only encourages people not to seek work and puts an unreasonable strain on a country’s financial resources.Discuss this statement and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;In modern day society, money is a driving force for nearly everyone. Most people aspire to be financially secure and to have the ability to live the life they want. However, not everyone is able to find paid employment, and for that reason in some countries around the world, governments have initiated a system where the unemployed receive a regular payment to enable them to survive. Some people believe it is an excellent idea, whilst others believe that it is exhausting a country’s financial resources.When looking at the positive aspects of this system, it can be said that it prevents individuals from having a private bankruptcy. When somebody becomes unemployed, he or she will have on-going costs such as rent for a dwelling, bills for water, telephone and electricity as well as the cost of food and several other things. Without a salary, this person will fall into debt, because they will be unable to cover these expenses. A national unemployment payment system will therefore prevent this person from losing nearly everything over time. Without such system, many people would become homeless and would potentially engage in criminal activities to survive. Therefore, one can say that this system is positive. Although stories are heard of people exploiting the system, usually the newly unemployed want to find a job fast in order to become financially independent again, meaning that the government does not have to support them for long.Although there are positive aspects of this system, one can also say that if the payment made by the government is too high, it will prevent people from looking for work actively. Occasionally, the payment people receive is higher than their potential salaries, deterring them from working and creating an on-going cost for the government. A potential solution for this could be providing free training and employment support to open up new career opportunities with higher income, which would motivate this group to re-enter the workforce.In conclusion, the unemployment benefits system has positive and negative aspects. Personally, I believe that the positive effects of the system outweigh the negative. The payment must remain on a level that helps people survive without regular salaries, but does not seem attractive to exploit over a longer period of time.;In today's society, money plays a significant role in motivating individuals to work towards financial stability and a desired lifestyle. However, not everyone has access to paid employment, prompting some governments worldwide to implement a system of regular payments to the unemployed, ensuring their basic needs are met. Opinions on this system are divided, with some viewing it as beneficial and others seeing it as a drain on national finances.On the positive side, this system prevents individuals from facing financial ruin. Unemployed individuals still have ongoing expenses such as rent, utility bills, and food costs. Without an income, these expenses can lead to debt and potentially homelessness, pushing some towards criminal activities for survival. The unemployment payment system acts as a safety net, preventing such outcomes and maintaining social stability. It's also worth noting that most newly unemployed individuals are keen to find work quickly to regain financial independence, which in turn reduces the government's support burden.Despite these benefits, there are drawbacks. If government payments are too generous, they can deter people from actively seeking employment. In some cases, the unemployment benefits exceed potential salaries, creating a long-term financial obligation for the government. A possible solution could be offering free training and employment assistance to unlock higher-paying job opportunities, motivating individuals to rejoin the workforce.In conclusion, the system of unemployment benefits presents both advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, the positive aspects of the system outweigh the negative ones. The key is to set the payment level at a point where it supports survival without discouraging the pursuit of employment. This balance is crucial for the system's effectiveness and sustainability, ensuring it remains a support rather than a long-term solution.
1314;Public health is becoming an urgent issue nowadays. Some argue that governments should create nutrition and food choice laws to improve public health, while others believe that it is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Public health has become an increasingly pressing issue in the modern world, with many populations facing rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related diseases. This has led to a debate as to whether governments should establish nutrition and food choice laws for the betterment of public health or if it solely falls on individuals to make wise choices. In my view, everyone should take ownership of their diet and assume responsibility for their health because it is the right choice.The argument for government-imposed nutrition and food choice laws is that they could help prevent people from making unhealthy choices which could lead to more serious illnesses down the line. For example, government regulations could limit the amount of sugar or fats allowed in food products, especially those marketed to children, and impose taxes on unhealthy snacks like chips and candy bars. This approach would also benefit those who lack the knowledge about healthy food, necessary to make informed decisions. By providing clear guidelines on what foods are healthy, and by taxing the unhealthy options higher, the government would steer individuals away from unhealthy options.However, there are also some valid arguments against governmental intervention. These types of regulations infringe upon individuals’ right to choose what they put in their bodies. After all, everyone should be free to make lifestyle choices for themselves. Additionally, there may not be enough evidence to suggest that overly restrictive regulations would have beneficial effects on public health outcomes in the long run. Since people’s love of unhealthy food is often considered an addiction, it is unlikely that a higher price or other warnings would be enough to deter individuals from purchasing unhealthy food items.In conclusion, while there can certainly be benefits associated with implementing nutrition and food choice laws at a governmental level, ultimately it should still come down to personal choice and responsibility as far as one’s diet is concerned. Governments should instead focus on providing citizens with better nutrition education, so that they can make better informed decisions about what they consume. This way, they can receive the information they need while still having autonomy over their own diets and lifestyles.;The issue of public health has become increasingly prominent in today's world, with rising rates of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related diseases affecting numerous populations. This has sparked a debate about whether governments should introduce laws governing nutrition and food choices to improve public health, or if individuals should be solely responsible for making informed decisions. In my opinion, it is essential for individuals to take ownership of their diets and prioritize their health, as this is the most responsible choice.Proponents of government-imposed nutrition and food choice laws argue that such regulations could prevent people from making unhealthy choices that may lead to severe illnesses in the future. For instance, government regulations could restrict the amount of sugar or fat in food products, particularly those targeted at children, and impose taxes on unhealthy snacks like chips and candy. This approach would also benefit individuals who lack knowledge about healthy food options, enabling them to make informed decisions. By providing clear guidelines on healthy foods and imposing higher taxes on unhealthy options, the government could steer individuals towards healthier choices.However, there are also valid counterarguments against government intervention. Such regulations would infringe upon individuals' right to choose what they eat, as everyone should be free to make their own lifestyle choices. Furthermore, there is limited evidence to suggest that overly restrictive regulations would have beneficial effects on public health outcomes in the long term. Given that the desire for unhealthy food is often considered an addiction, it is unlikely that higher prices or warning labels would be sufficient to deter individuals from purchasing unhealthy food items.In conclusion, while implementing nutrition and food choice laws at a government level may have some benefits, ultimately, personal choice and responsibility should remain paramount when it comes to one's diet. Instead of imposing regulations, governments should focus on providing citizens with better nutrition education, enabling them to make informed decisions about their diet. This approach would allow individuals to receive the necessary information while still maintaining autonomy over their diets and lifestyles.
267;Reporting of crimes and other kinds of violent news on television and in newspapers can have adverse consquences. This kind of information should be restricted from being shown in the media. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Reporting violent crimes and other violent issues could represents a adverse consequence sometimes. Overall, it is important to enphasyded that people are geting more and more violant and we can't blame only media as a mainly factor for those behavior.This kind of questions is almost a phylosical one and we will keeping this doubt for a long time, or even never now if people are becoming more agressive because they are more expousure to this kind of news, or if we are having more report regarding to violence just because people are getting more violent.I believe that people could feel estimulated to be a criminous person when they have a minimium certain that they won't be punish.For instance, stolen and other minimius crimes had increase at california region after they anounced that stolen under tham $1000 are consider a crime anymore. So the sensation that people could do anything wrong and that is no penalty for that, estimulates the number for stolen.In other hand, when we see some hardly rules the number of crime are dipest low, as we can see at Dubai, for instance. As all penalties are really hard and strongly implemented this place is considering highest safe.I bilieve that restricting any kind of information be showen in the media doesn't solve the problem, and, in fact, bring another new problem related to limited population information. When people know what are happening, type of crimes, etc, they could be prepare to handle with those problems and prevent theirselves.;Reporting violent crimes and other violent issues can have adverse consequences at times. However, it's essential to emphasize that the increasing violence in society cannot be attributed solely to the media. This is a complex and philosophical question that may persist for a long time, as it's unclear whether people are becoming more aggressive due to exposure to violent news or if the rise in reported violence is a result of increased aggression in society.I believe that individuals may feel encouraged to engage in criminal behavior when they perceive a low risk of punishment. For example, after California announced that thefts under $1000 would no longer be considered a crime, there was an increase in thefts in the region. The perception that there are no consequences for committing minor crimes can stimulate an increase in such offenses.On the other hand, when strict laws are implemented, crime rates tend to decrease significantly, as seen in Dubai. The harsh penalties and strong enforcement in this region have contributed to its reputation as a safe place.I don't think that restricting the information shown in the media is an effective solution to the problem, and it may even create new issues related to limited access to information. When people are informed about the types of crimes and other issues, they can take steps to protect themselves and prevent problems. By being aware of what's happening, individuals can prepare and handle potential threats more effectively.
1;Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Poverty represents a worldwide crisis. It is the ugliest epidemic in a region, which could infect countries in the most debilitating ways. To tackle this issue, rich countries need to help those in need and give a hand when possible. I agree that there are several ways of aiding poor countries other than financial aid, like providing countries in need with engineers, workers, and soldiers who would build infrastructure. Building universities, hospitals, and roadways. By having a solid infrastructure, poor countries would be able to monetise their profits and build a stronger and more profitable economy which would help them in the long term. Once unprivilged countries find their niche, the major hurdle would be passed and would definitely pave the way for much brighter future. However, I do disagree that financial aid does not solve poverty, it does if used properly and efficiently. The most determining factor if financial aid would be the way to go, is by identifying what type of poor countries' representative are dealing with. Some countries will have a responsible leader and some will not, with that being said, implementing a strategy, to distinguish responsible leaders from others, would tailor the type of aid rich countries could use. An example, A clear report and constant observation would be applied to track the progress and how this type of aid is being monetized. In summary, types of aid varies from country to another, and tailoring the type of aid is of paramount importance to solve this problem that had huge toll on poor countries.;Poverty is a global crisis that has a devastating impact on regions and countries. It is a pervasive and debilitating issue that requires a comprehensive and multifaceted approach to address. I firmly believe that rich countries have a responsibility to assist those in need, and there are various ways to do so beyond just providing financial aid. For instance, offering expertise and human resources such as engineers, workers, and soldiers can help build critical infrastructure like universities, hospitals, and roadways. By establishing a solid foundation, poor countries can capitalize on their resources and develop a more robust and profitable economy, ultimately leading to long-term prosperity. Once underprivileged countries discover their strengths and specialties, they can overcome significant obstacles and pave the way for a brighter future.However, I disagree with the notion that financial aid is ineffective in alleviating poverty. When utilized properly and efficiently, financial aid can be a potent tool in combating poverty. The key to successful financial aid lies in identifying the type of leadership and governance in the recipient country. Some countries have responsible and reliable leaders, while others do not. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a strategy to distinguish between responsible and irresponsible leaders, tailoring the type of aid provided accordingly. A transparent and rigorous monitoring system, including regular reporting and observation, can help track progress and ensure that aid is being utilized effectively.In conclusion, the type of aid required varies significantly from one country to another, and it is essential to customize the aid approach to address the unique needs and circumstances of each country. By acknowledging and adapting to these differences, we can make meaningful strides in solving the complex and pressing issue of poverty, which has a profound impact on poor countries and their citizens.
1381;Schools should select students by their academic abilities, agree or disagree?;Some people think that schools should select students according to their academic abilities, while others believe that it is better to have students with different abilities studying together. Discuss both views and state your own opinion.Some people contend that mixed ability classes are more beneficial for children’s development than streaming them on the basis of judgement about their academic abilities. However, from my perspective, I disagree with this contention.Admittedly, mixed ability classes provide a better environment for children’s all-round development. In such classes, children with different abilities study together and in turn they can learn from one another. From example, a student, who is good at academic study but weak in dancing or painting, can learn how to dance or paint his peers. In this sense, mixed ability classes allow students to develop their abilities in different subjects instead of only academic abilities.Despite the argument above, I believe streaming students brings more benefits to teachers and students. As for teachers, separating children with better academic abilities from others facilitates effective teaching. This practice helps teachers to control their students more conveniently and easily. Compared with mixed ability in which teacher should consider students’ differences when they are using teaching methodologies, streaming makes this situation simpler. To be more specific, students are at the same level of academic ability in a class, and in turn teachers can use the same methodologies for them all. In this way, the narrower the spread of ability in the class, the more convenient the teaching can be.On top of this, enables students to learn in an effective way. According to students’ different abilities, they are taught in different ways that are more suitable for them. In the top streams, students use more difficult materials, therefore, they can learn more. In sharp contrast, teachers can explain the material more slowly to those in bottom streams. Under this circumstance, students with different academic abilities can study effectively and efficiently.In the final analysis, mixed ability classes are beneficial for students’ versatile development, but in my opinion, segregating students based on different academic ability is better for both teachers and students.The writer presented a balanced discussion of the topic, effortlessly delivered in a form of a fluent, well-written IELTS essay. The arguments and reasoning are laid out in a coherent, logical way. A wide range of vocabulary is used in this work. There are very few spelling errors that could have been caught in an additional round of proofreading (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). Keep up the good work! Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;The debate surrounding the selection of students in schools has sparked a heated discussion. Some argue that schools should group students based on their academic abilities, while others contend that a mixed-ability approach is more beneficial. This essay will explore both perspectives and present my stance on the matter.On one hand, it is believed that mixed-ability classes provide a more comprehensive learning environment for children. In such settings, students with diverse abilities learn from one another, allowing them to develop a broader range of skills. For instance, a student who excels academically but struggles with creative pursuits like dancing or painting can learn from their peers. This approach enables students to expand their abilities beyond academic pursuits.However, from my perspective, I disagree with this viewpoint. I firmly believe that segregating students based on their academic abilities yields more benefits for both teachers and students. For educators, separating students by ability facilitates more effective teaching. This practice allows teachers to manage their classes more conveniently, as they can employ uniform teaching methodologies tailored to the students' abilities. In a streamed class, where students share similar academic abilities, teachers can adopt a single approach, making the teaching process more efficient.Moreover, streaming enables students to learn more effectively. Students are taught using methods suited to their abilities, allowing them to absorb information more efficiently. In top streams, students engage with more challenging materials, thereby enhancing their learning experience. In contrast, teachers can explain concepts at a slower pace to students in lower streams, ensuring that all students can learn effectively.In conclusion, while mixed-ability classes foster versatile development, I firmly believe that segregating students by academic ability is more beneficial for both teachers and students. This approach enables tailored teaching methods, efficient learning, and better classroom management.The writer presented a well-structured discussion, delivering a fluent and well-written IELTS essay. The arguments and reasoning are coherent and logical, with a wide range of vocabulary used throughout. Although there are minor spelling errors, the essay demonstrates exceptional quality, warranting an IELTS Band 8 score. Overall, the writer has made a compelling case for their perspective, and with further refinement, their work will continue to excel.
1337;Scientists believe that the world is in danger due to environmental changes. Some people say that personal lifestyle changes should be made to reduce the damage to environment, while others think that the government should do something to help. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Environmental problems are clearly something that is often discussed in today’s world. One part of the society claims that individuals should change their habits and lifestyle to improve the ecological situation. Others, on the other hand, believe that this issue should be solved on the governmental level. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and my perspective will be offered.It is hard to deny that human kind is responsible for the current environmental situation, and it seems impossible to achieve any noticeable result in this field without the participation of vast majority of individuals. For instance, a simple lifestyle change such as introducing the separation of household rubbish can make recycling projects more convenient and efficient. Moreover, consumers can reduce their usage of plastic items and, in turn, less plastic waste will contaminate the environment.However, many people still feel that the government has more tools to prevent environmental changes. One option that the authorities have is to discourage citizens from using personal vehicles by charging high taxes and additional fees. Moreover, politicians usually have access to resources to educate people about environmental problems and promote the most important ecological projects on all levels, ranging from special courses at schools to TV shows and websites related to this topic. Furthermore, it is a key responsibility of the government to protect the environment by spending state funds on research and modern equipment. Countries where legislation protects the ecology, for example Norway, have achieved visible results and overcame most environmental problems.In conclusion, I believe that a combined approach will work best to prevent or reverse environmental changes. A contribution of every individual is just as important as the intervention from the government in order to fix existing issues and save our planet for future generations.;The issue of environmental problems is a pervasive and frequently discussed topic in today's world. A segment of society argues that individuals must adapt their habits and lifestyle to enhance the ecological situation, while others contend that this issue should be addressed at the governmental level. This essay aims to examine both perspectives and provide my viewpoint.It is undeniable that human activities are largely responsible for the current state of the environment, and it appears that significant progress cannot be made without the involvement of the vast majority of individuals. For example, a simple change in lifestyle, such as implementing household waste separation, can make recycling projects more efficient and convenient. Additionally, consumers can reduce their use of plastic items, resulting in less plastic waste contaminating the environment.However, many people believe that the government possesses more effective tools to mitigate environmental changes. The authorities have the option to discourage the use of personal vehicles by imposing high taxes and additional fees. Furthermore, politicians have access to resources to educate the public about environmental issues and promote key ecological projects at various levels, ranging from school courses to television shows and websites. It is also a primary responsibility of the government to allocate state funds to research and modern equipment to protect the environment. Countries with legislation that safeguards the environment, such as Norway, have achieved notable results and overcome most environmental problems.In conclusion, I firmly believe that a collaborative approach is the most effective way to prevent or reverse environmental changes. The contribution of every individual is equally important as government intervention in addressing existing issues and preserving the planet for future generations. A combined effort from both individuals and the government is necessary to make a significant impact and create a more sustainable environment.
1373;Senior managers should have higher salaries than other employees (agree/disagree);In many countries senior positions have higher salaries compared to those of young workers of the same company. Some people think this isn’t justified. Do you agree or disagree?While some believe that rewarding those in managerial positions with higher pay packets is appropriate, not everyone agrees with this view. Personally, I am leaning towards the latter position due to negative impacts caused by significant difference in salaries within a company.For one, executive officers should know that higher than sufficient salaries are not necessary. Indeed, the higher the remuneration they receive, the more likely the company to suffer from devoid of financial capability. Furthermore, they often gain powers that money can’t buy. For instance, they often make important decisions over how to make their company thrive. They are also entitled to allocate company’s budget and designate tasks to other workers. these non-financial entitlements, they should refrain from earning more than reasonable amounts as salaries.Unreasonably high salaries granted to the executives can also afflict other employees. In fact, it is foreseeable that many employees would feel powerless or even when they find out about the huge salary gap between the executive officers’ and theirs. Accordingly, some may leave the company, and others may go on to strike and demand a pay increase. However, those actions . Therefore, unfair salary systems like this would yield unhealthy working environment for both employers and employees.In conclusion, I oppose to those in managerial roles with obscene amounts of compensation because it can cost the company its prosperity and discourage other employees . Thus it is recommended for the company to decide on the salaries of executive officers and general workers by adopting a more motivating salary system.This is a good example of an IELTS Band 8 essay. The task statement is sufficiently discussed, and the writer’s arguments are relevant and well developed. There are only 2 body paragraphs, but they are coherent and help to organise the information. Linking words are used appropriately to sequence ideas. Skillful use of synonyms throughout the essay demonstrates the writer’s vocabulary. Some of the expressions used aren’t entirely suitable or accurate, but there aren’t many of them. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.0.;In many countries, senior positions in companies tend to offer higher salaries than those of younger employees. However, some individuals argue that this disparity is unjustified. I tend to disagree with the notion that senior executives should receive substantially higher salaries than their junior counterparts. In my opinion, significant salary differences within a company can have negative consequences.Firstly, senior executives should recognize that excessively high salaries are not necessary. In fact, the more they earn, the more likely the company is to suffer from financial constraints. Moreover, they often possess powers and privileges that cannot be bought with money, such as making crucial decisions about the company's direction and allocating budgets. Given these non-financial benefits, it is reasonable to expect them to refrain from earning unreasonable amounts. Unreasonably high salaries for senior executives can also have a detrimental impact on other employees. When employees discover the substantial salary gap between themselves and senior executives, they may feel undervalued and powerless, leading some to leave the company or demand pay increases through strikes. This can create an unhealthy work environment for both employers and employees. In conclusion, I disagree with the practice of paying senior executives excessively high salaries, as it can harm the company's prosperity and demotivate other employees. Therefore, companies should adopt a more equitable salary system that motivates all employees, rather than just senior executives.This essay is a good example of an IELTS Band 8 essay, as it thoroughly discusses the task statement and presents relevant, well-developed arguments. The two body paragraphs are coherent and well-organized, using linking words to sequence ideas effectively. The writer demonstrates a good command of vocabulary, using synonyms skillfully throughout the essay. While some expressions may not be entirely suitable or accurate, they are relatively few in number. Overall, this essay is worthy of an IELTS Band 8.0 score.
1357;Should employers pay more attention to personal qualities rather than qualifications?;"While recruiting a new employee, the employer should pay more attention to their personal qualities, rather than qualifications and experience. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and include relevant examples.Recent decades have witnessed a burgeoning growth of numerous industries; therefore, recruiting the right person for the position is crucial to the development of enterprises. But how do we determine if a person is the best fit? Advocates of conventional recruitment methods opine that this candidate must have sufficient experience and qualifications needed for that job. Nevertheless, some people argue that candidates’ personal qualities cannot be ignored. In my view, both components are of equal importance.To begin with, the conventional approach of checking potential workers’ qualifications via their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, issued qualifications and certifications from authorised organisations is vital. Apparently, whenever we submit a job application, we are always required to attach a CV while a cover letter is optional. Without a decent qualification, even if that candidate’s personal characteristics are suitable, the enterprise will need to carry out lots of skill trainings eventually.On the other hand, occasionally during an interview some HR officers ignore the significance of assessing how candidates’ individual qualities can fit in the company. Employers should assess not only candidates’ qualifications but also their enabling skills, ethics and value propositions. The more an employee’s personal qualities fit in a company’s culture and values, the more he or she is motivated to contribute to that company’s vision. KPMG is a great example of evaluating candidates’ personal qualifications and skills by utilising a game-based assessment process, followed by a video interview. This methodology enables a comprehensive assessment, and is embraced by many companies nowadays.To summarise, employers should assess both personal characteristics and formal qualifications when recruiting people as each of these elements has its own vital contribution to make in talent-seeking enterprises.This response covers the topic well. The writer’s position is clearly expressed and supported by an example, the use of paragraphing makes this essay organised and easy to follow. Linking words are used appropriately. The use of complex sentences and advanced vocabulary is impressive. Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.";When recruiting new employees, should employers prioritize personal qualities over qualifications and experience? I partially agree with this statement, as both aspects are crucial in determining the best candidate for a position.The rapid growth of various industries in recent decades has made it essential to recruit the right person for the job, as it plays a vital role in the development of enterprises. However, the question remains as to how to determine the most suitable candidate. Proponents of traditional recruitment methods argue that a candidate's experience and qualifications are the primary considerations. On the other hand, some people believe that personal qualities should not be overlooked. In my opinion, both components are equally important.To start with, the conventional method of evaluating potential employees' qualifications through their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, and certifications from authorized organizations is essential. When applying for a job, it is typically mandatory to attach a CV, while a cover letter is optional. Without adequate qualifications, even if a candidate's personal characteristics are suitable, the company would need to provide extensive training, which can be time-consuming and costly.On the other hand, some HR officers often neglect to assess how a candidate's individual qualities fit into the company culture during interviews. Employers should evaluate not only a candidate's qualifications but also their soft skills, ethics, and value propositions. The more an employee's personal qualities align with the company's culture and values, the more motivated they will be to contribute to the company's vision. For instance, KPMG uses a game-based assessment process, followed by a video interview, to evaluate candidates' personal qualifications and skills. This approach enables a comprehensive evaluation and is being adopted by many companies nowadays.In conclusion, employers should consider both personal characteristics and formal qualifications when recruiting, as each element has a vital contribution to make in talent-seeking enterprises.

1385;Should people spend a lot on weddings and birthday parties?;"Some people think that spending a lot on holding wedding parties, birthday parties and other celebrations is just a waste of money. Others, however, think that these are necessary for individuals and the society. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Throwing parties can be expensive. While some people do not find these fancy gatherings worth what they cost, others believe such events are important to both individuals and the society.People choose to throw parties for a number of reasons. For starters, they can make better teams. Project kick-off parties are good opportunities to break the ice and help team members to know each other better. Celebrating a victory create a sense of success and belonging. Companies do not see parties as of money and allocate budget to support such events; moreover, they often leave good memories. From our own experiences, we all have happy memories of our birthday parties when we were little. Every family has great photos at family gatherings in their album. In addition, contrary to what some people believe that spending on parties is a waste of social resources, they actually create value, either by employing people in the party-planning business or by offering people better experiences.The popularity of parties, however, causes some tension in the society. They are hard on introverted people who find themselves uncomfortable in the crowd. This is a clinic symptom which psychologists call “social anxiety disorder”. There are other ways to celebrate important events that may have greater value for their cost. For instance, companies could send out gifts after successful projects and parents could take their children on family trips to celebrate birthdays.In my opinion, while a party is a form of social event that brings many benefits to individuals and the society, other choices should also be considered, either to cut spending or to relieve the stress of those who are not fond of crowded celebrations.This is a very good essay. Other than minor inaccuracies there are no problems (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows corrections). Seems to be worth IELTS Band 8.";"Some people argue that spending a significant amount of money on wedding parties, birthday parties, and other celebrations is a frivolous expense.

While some individuals do not believe that these elaborate gatherings are worth the expense, others think that such events are vital for both personal and societal development. People organize parties for various reasons. Firstly, they can foster teamwork and camaraderie. For instance, project kick-off parties provide an excellent opportunity to break the ice and facilitate team members to get to know each other better. Celebrating a victory creates a sense of accomplishment and belonging. Companies do not view parties as a waste of money and allocate a budget to support such events; moreover, they often create lasting memories. From our own experiences, we all have fond memories of our birthday parties when we were young. Every family has cherished photos from family gatherings in their albums. Additionally, contrary to the belief that spending on parties is a waste of social resources, they actually generate value, either by employing people in the party-planning business or by offering people unique experiences.However, the popularity of parties can cause tension in society. They can be overwhelming for introverted individuals who find themselves uncomfortable in crowded settings. This is a common symptom that psychologists refer to as ""social anxiety disorder"". There are alternative ways to celebrate significant events that may provide greater value for the cost. For example, companies could send gifts to employees after successful projects, and parents could take their children on family trips to celebrate birthdays.In my opinion, while parties are a form of social event that brings numerous benefits to individuals and society, other options should also be considered, either to reduce spending or to alleviate the stress of those who are not fond of crowded celebrations. By doing so, we can ensure that everyone can participate and enjoy these events without feeling overwhelmed or financially burdened."
1393;Should the same laws which prohibit the sale and consumption of heroin be applied to tobacco? Discuss.;Recently, a heated debate when a few reputable health organizations suggested the application of a similar act of heroin selling and usage prohibition . In this , I will analyze why the adoption of such a law could be a breakthrough in our youngsters’ safety, according to my vision.Firstly, tobacco does not differ much from heroin when it comes to the addictive effect. , the active ingredient in tobacco, exerts its effect by acting directly on smoker’s brain cells. Numerous experiments carried out by on animals, rats, proved that this toxic chemical does lead time to dependency, similarly to the effect experienced with .Secondly, the restriction on selling would surely show an instant decline in tobacco smoking. ” Having easy access to cigarettes puts a tremendous pressure, especially on teenagers,to resist such a temptation” Dr.Hisham , head of department at Alexandria Medical college , states firmly. “Giving the new generation the sense that the severity of smoking is to other lethal drugs usage be a life saving step, they will thank us for as they get older.” he continues.To recapitulate, applying of a futuristic law such as the suggested one will have a positive impact ,not only on young people’s health but on our society as a whole.;"A recent debate has sparked intense discussion after several reputable health organizations proposed implementing a law similar to the prohibition of heroin sales and use. In this analysis, I will examine why adopting such a law could be a groundbreaking step towards ensuring the safety of our youth, from my perspective.Firstly, tobacco is comparable to heroin in terms of its addictive effects. The active ingredient in tobacco directly affects brain cells, leading to dependency. Numerous animal experiments, particularly those involving rats, have demonstrated that this toxic chemical can lead to addiction, similar to the effects of heroin. This similarity in addictive potential highlights the need for stringent regulations on tobacco sales and use.Secondly, restricting tobacco sales would likely result in an immediate decline in smoking rates. According to Dr. Hisham, head of the department at Alexandria Medical College, ""Having easy access to cigarettes puts tremendous pressure on teenagers to resist temptation."" He firmly states, ""Giving the new generation the understanding that the severity of smoking is comparable to the use of other lethal drugs will be a lifesaving step, and they will thank us for it as they get older."" This expert opinion underscores the potential benefits of limiting tobacco access, especially among young people.In conclusion, applying a forward-thinking law like the one suggested would have a positive impact not only on the health of young people but also on our society as a whole. By treating tobacco with the same seriousness as heroin, we may be able to reduce smoking rates, protect our youth, and create a safer, healthier community."
1394;Should wealthy nations be required to share their wealth with poorer nations by providing them with things such as food and education? Or is this the responsibility of the governments of poorer nations to look after their citizens?;I think that wealthy nations should be required to share their wealth with poorer nations. at providing such things as food and education because of the three following reasons.Firstly, citizens of both wealthy nations and poorer nations are human beings. Therefore, we can not look at, hear of, or talk about people who lack food, education, without compassion and sympathy. Sharing wealth with poorer nations is not only a good deed but is also a .Secondly, many nations in Africa and Asia are poor. Famine, diseases, crime and illiteracy are killing the citizens of these countries. , many nations in Europe and America are rich. If there are no actions taken, this inequality will increase dramatically. Poor countries will become poorer while rich countries will become richer. As a result, the poorest countries will become slaves of the richest countries. So, sharing wealth is useful way to prevent people from that bad future.Thirdly, although sharing wealth with poorer nations is very necessarythis help should only stop at providing such things as food, medicine and education. Or else, poor nations may become dependent on the aid. They may lose enthusiasm to build their countries by themselves. Moreover, rich nations can take advantage of sharing wealth to interfere with the governance of poor nations’. This can’t be considered a humane action and should be prevented.In my opinion, sharing wealth with poorer nations has both a bad side and a good side. What we have to do is its bad side and its good side.;Firstly, the fundamental humanity that unites us all dictates that we cannot ignore the plight of those lacking basic necessities. As human beings, we are compelled to respond with compassion and sympathy to those in need. Sharing wealth with poorer nations is not only a benevolent act but also a moral imperative.Secondly, the stark contrast between the wealth of nations in Europe and America and the poverty in many African and Asian countries is alarming. The lack of access to basic necessities like food, education, and healthcare in these poorer nations leads to devastating outcomes such as famine, disease, crime, and illiteracy. If left unchecked, this inequality will escalate, leading to a future where poor countries become increasingly dependent on rich ones, potentially falling into a state of economic subservience. Sharing wealth can mitigate this catastrophic scenario by bridging the gap between rich and poor nations.Thirdly, while sharing wealth with poorer nations is indispensable, it's crucial that this assistance is limited to providing essential items like food, medicine, and education. Overextending aid can foster dependency in poor nations, stifling their motivation to develop independently. Furthermore, rich nations might exploit their wealth-sharing efforts to interfere with the governance of poor nations, which would be an inhumane act that undermines the sovereignty of recipient countries.In conclusion, sharing wealth with poorer nations has both beneficial and detrimental aspects. The key is to understand and balance both sides to ensure that wealth sharing serves as a tool for empowerment and development, rather than a means of perpetuating dependency or exploitation.
1302;Social media has become a real problem for some young people today, and governments should create laws that allow only people over 18 years of age to have accounts.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Social media today is extremely significant to a majority of the population, especially the younger generation. Many teenagers find it exceptionally convenient and necessary for communication and entertainment. However, not everyone is able to use social media responsibly, which gave rise to the idea of making it accessible to only those older than eighteen years of age.Though there are negatives, such as cyber-bullying, or being too distracted by these modern media, there are issues surrounding most things in life. It is a choice to go onto a social media website, and many younger people are capable of managing accounts without any difficulties. It is not the government’s responsibility to monitor under eighteen-year olds; that is for the parents.Statistics show that over eighty per cent of teens use a form of online social media. It allows them to chat online, easily stay in contact with friends and family across the world, and see updates on others’ lives (through text, photos or videos). Social media is a way to express thoughts or ideas and to stay in contact with the rest of the world.To not permit one of the largest Internet-using demographics to use social media because a few people have problems with it is an irrational and an unfair restriction. Not only would profit be lost with fewer users, but controlling who creates accounts and monitoring proof of age would be difficult as well. I believe that laws should not make social media inaccessible to young people under eighteen; this would be unnecessary and absurd.";The significance of social media in today's world cannot be overstated, particularly among the younger generation. For many teenagers, social media platforms have become an indispensable tool for communication, entertainment, and self-expression. While it is true that some individuals may not use these platforms responsibly, leading to concerns about issues like cyberbullying and distraction, it is crucial to recognize that such problems are inherent to many aspects of life. The decision to engage with social media is a personal choice, and many young people demonstrate the ability to manage their accounts without encountering difficulties. The responsibility for monitoring the online activities of minors lies with their parents, not the government.Data indicates that a substantial majority, over 80%, of teenagers utilize some form of online social media. These platforms enable them to communicate with peers and family members worldwide, stay updated on the lives of others through various media, and express their thoughts and ideas. By serving as a global connectivity tool, social media plays a vital role in the lives of young people, facilitating communication and the exchange of ideas across geographical boundaries.Prohibiting one of the largest demographics of internet users from accessing social media due to the irresponsible behavior of a minority would be both irrational and unfair. Such a restriction would not only result in significant financial losses due to reduced user numbers but would also pose considerable logistical challenges, including the verification of age and the enforcement of account creation rules. In conclusion, I firmly believe that legislation should not restrict access to social media for individuals under the age of eighteen. Such a measure would be unnecessary and absurd, failing to address the root causes of irresponsible social media use while unfairly penalizing a vast majority of responsible young users.
771;Society is based on rules and laws. If individuals were free to do whatever they want to do, it could not function. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the above statement?;It is commonly held that society can operate perfectly by a set of rules. It means that providing total freedom to people undoubtedly results in chaos with the further possibility of total collapse. I strongly agree with this point of view as I am in the opinion that rules play a significant role in creating a stable society. In this essay, this idea will be discussed in detail.Basically, a set of rules can be helpful to achieve productive results in such essential areas as medicine and construction. For example, it is necessary to develop common procedures of operations in surgery or traffic rules for public transport. Unless there are not standardized, it might cause a lot of deaths or at least injuries. Constructing also should be based on common processes because comfort and safe accommodation is a necessity for many people. Although there are people who consider rules and laws limiting and imposing, it can be argued that they are critical in the organization of humanity.Laws are not obstacles on the way to people's freedom because they are established to regulate formal relationships when it is difficult to find a compromise informally. Moreover, they are vitally important when people face crime and violence. Without any system of justice solving crimes becomes more challenging. All criminal accidents tend to be out of control and spread around the world immediately. Shoplifting, robbery, and even disastrous wars can plunge our world into darkness. This way humanity might face total chaos where morals values and behavioral patterns are neglected. In this context, the word ‘society’ risks becoming totally meaningless, as its main definition is a 'group of people with common traditions and rules.'From the arguments presented above, one may conclude that any society needs standards, laws, or even moral principles. They form a foundation for safety, a good level of medicine, and science that allows to create a strong society and manage any difficulties or threats that may disturb people’s well-being.;"The notion that a society can function flawlessly with a set of rules is a widely accepted idea. This implies that granting people absolute freedom would inevitably lead to chaos and potentially even collapse. I firmly believe in this perspective, as I think that rules are essential in maintaining a stable society. This essay will delve into this concept in greater detail.Having a set of rules is crucial for achieving productive outcomes in vital areas such as medicine and construction. For instance, establishing standardized procedures for surgical operations and traffic rules for public transportation is necessary. Without these standards, it could result in a significant number of fatalities or injuries. Similarly, construction should be guided by common processes to ensure that people have access to safe and comfortable accommodation. Although some individuals view rules and laws as restrictive and imposing, it can be argued that they are vital for organizing human society.Laws are not barriers to people's freedom; rather, they are established to regulate formal relationships when informal compromises are difficult to reach. Moreover, they are essential when people encounter crime and violence. Without a justice system, solving crimes becomes more challenging, and criminal incidents can quickly spiral out of control and spread globally. Crimes like shoplifting, robbery, and even devastating wars can plunge the world into darkness, leading to a state of total chaos where moral values and behavioral patterns are disregarded. In such a scenario, the concept of'society' risks losing its meaning, as its primary definition is a 'group of people with shared traditions and rules.'Based on the arguments presented, it can be concluded that any society requires standards, laws, and moral principles. These elements form the foundation for safety, advanced medicine, and science, which are necessary for building a strong society and managing challenges or threats that may compromise people's well-being. Ultimately, rules and laws play a significant role in creating a stable and functional society, and their importance cannot be overstated."
1352;Some believe the government should take care of retirees, while others think everyone should save for their own retirement (opinion);Some people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.It is true that when people advance into their golden years, they require more help and attention. For that reason, a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly. However, I tend to agree with those who argue that workers should be saving a portion of their income to have a nest egg in their retirement.To begin with, a culture of saving rather than depending on the government may foster the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government. As a result, the government would be able to release more funds to more productive purposes, such as development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which may expedite the overall progression of a country.In addition to economic factors, putting money aside has some personal benefits. Since savings-oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses, this may instill a sense of self-respect and pride in them. On the other hand, those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma, as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society. Hence, to live a life with dignity and pride, taking responsibility for funding one’s own retirement is evidently a better option from individual perspective.In contrast, the provision of monetary outlays for retirees has proven unfeasible in many countries. Since in many nations the number of senior citizens is on the rise, in the long run governments are likely to struggle to sustain the cost of providing for the elderly. The early signs of this have been seen in many countries that were forced to raise the retirement age, including my home country where men can now retire at the age of 67 instead of 65. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, these kinds of support may become completely unsustainable.In conclusion, the provision of state monetary support may undoubtedly lessen the concern of retirees to some extent. However, considering the issue of sustainability of this provision, it is better to opt for individual savings from the very beginning of working life, for the benefit of both individual and national development.This response addresses all parts of the topic, by discussing the merits of funding one’s own retirement versus relying on government pension. The writer’s opinion has been stated as well and is very clear. The neat presentation of ideas has been helped by appropriate paragraphing, and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay. The author’s vocabulary seems to be rich and there is a variety of sentence structures used in this essay. Overall, this essay deserves an IELTS Band 8.;The debate surrounding the responsibility of caring for the elderly has sparked a contentious discussion. While some advocate for the government to provide financial support to retirees, others argue that individuals should be responsible for saving during their working years to fund their own retirement. In my opinion, I agree with the latter group, who believe that workers should set aside a portion of their income to secure their future.First and foremost, adopting a savings-oriented mindset, rather than relying on government assistance, can have a positive impact on a country's economic development. By accumulating their own savings for retirement, individuals can reduce the financial burden on the government, allowing it to allocate more funds to productive purposes such as infrastructure development, industries, and healthcare. This, in turn, can expedite the overall progression of a country. For instance, countries with a strong culture of saving tend to have more stable economies and better infrastructure.In addition to the economic benefits, saving for retirement has personal advantages. Individuals who are self-sufficient and not reliant on government support tend to have a greater sense of self-respect and pride. In contrast, those who depend on financial assistance often face social stigma, being perceived as inferior members of society. Therefore, taking responsibility for funding one's own retirement is a better option from an individual perspective, as it allows for a life of dignity and pride.On the other hand, providing monetary support for retirees has proven to be unfeasible in many countries. With the rising number of senior citizens, governments are likely to struggle to sustain the cost of providing for the elderly in the long run. This is evident in countries that have been forced to raise the retirement age, such as my home country, where men can now retire at 67 instead of 65. Consequently, in the foreseeable future, these kinds of support may become completely unsustainable.In conclusion, while government monetary support may alleviate some concerns for retirees, considering the issue of sustainability, it is better to opt for individual savings from the beginning of working life. This approach benefits both individual and national development, allowing for a more stable and secure future. By prioritizing savings and taking responsibility for our own retirement, we can ensure a dignified and self-sufficient life, while also contributing to the economic growth and development of our country. 
1398;Some businesses prohibit smoking in any of their offices. Some governments have banned smoking in all public places. Do you agree or disagree that this is the right course of action? Give reasons for your opinion.;, organization and companies as well as governments impose restrictions in work places and public amenities. It has become fashionable in the world today . I feel that smoking can be harmful, but I don’t think it should be forbidden completely. I would also argue that people should have the whether or not they should smoke.Allow me to present the three positive sides of smoking. Firstly, smoking certainly helps many people to relax. For some, it even improves concentration. If someone is upset or they have , to smoke to reduce the pressure or tension. people like to smoke when they are relaxing with friends. Secondly, governments throughout the world make huge profits from taxes on cigarettes. The income obtained through taxes provides funds which are used for building and public places such as parks, gardens, sports ground and foot paths. Thirdly, tobacco industry also employs tens of thousands of people all over the world, particularly in poorer countries such as Zimbabwe or the Philippines. Without cigarettes, these people would have no jobs.Despite these positive are lots of negative effects to smoking too. Initially, smoking has been proven to be very dangerous for health. cigarette contains more than 4000 chemical substances, therefore, it dangerous diseases such as heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis or lung cancer. According to a recent report in Britain close to 3,500 people are killed each year in road accidents and 120,000 are killed by smoking. Furthermore, smoking costs governments millions of dollars because of the large number of people who need treatment in hospitals for smoking-related problems. Moreover, passive smoking is also a major concern today. Recent research shows that non-smokers can suffer from health problems if they spend long periods of time among people who do smoke. In the UK children whose parents are are three times as likely to start smoking themselves .In short, I think the world would be a better place without cigarettes. However, the decision of whether smoke or not to smoke should be for each individual to make. I suggest that people should not smoke in a room or a place where there are non smokers, however they should be free to smoke elsewhere.;In recent years, organizations, companies, and governments have imposed restrictions on smoking in workplaces and public amenities, making it a trendy practice worldwide. While I acknowledge the harmful effects of smoking, I don't believe it should be completely banned. Instead, I think individuals should have the freedom to choose whether or not to smoke. Let me present three positive aspects of smoking. Firstly, smoking can be a stress-reliever for many people, and some even claim it improves their concentration. When people are upset or under pressure, smoking can be a way to calm down. Socially, smoking is often associated with relaxation and socializing with friends. Secondly, governments generate significant revenue from cigarette taxes, which are used to fund public facilities like parks, gardens, sports grounds, and footpaths. Thirdly, the tobacco industry provides employment opportunities for tens of thousands of people globally, particularly in developing countries such as Zimbabwe and the Philippines, where jobs are scarce.Despite these positives, smoking has numerous negative effects. Primarily, smoking poses serious health risks, as cigarettes contain over 4,000 chemical substances that can cause diseases like heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis, and lung cancer. According to a recent report in Britain, approximately 3,500 people die in road accidents annually, whereas 120,000 die from smoking-related illnesses. Furthermore, smoking imposes substantial financial burdens on governments, which have to cover the medical expenses of smoking-related problems. Additionally, passive smoking has become a significant concern, as research indicates that non-smokers can develop health issues if they spend extended periods among smokers. In the UK, children of smoking parents are three times more likely to start smoking themselves.In conclusion, although I believe a world without cigarettes would be a better place, the decision to smoke or not should ultimately rest with each individual. I propose that smokers should be considerate of non-smokers and refrain from smoking in enclosed spaces or areas where non-smokers are present, but they should be free to smoke elsewhere.
665;Some cities create housing areas by providing taller buildings. Others create housing by building houses on a wider area of land. What solution is better?;Some big cities, especially in Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama in Japan tend to build taller buildings like skyscrapers. Other local cities and places where are scarcely populated are built wider. This is quite understandable in terms of space, and there might be some solutions to dissipate populations around Japan.Initially, the main reason why people tend to gather in big cities is that there are many opportunities to get a job. There are famous headquarter companies and branches that are based in foreign countries. Therefore, more and more people move to the big cities so that many taller apartments and buildings are built to let them live in the limited space. There seems to be stressful due to people being densely populated, but infrastructures are well organized, especially transport, medical care, and security.In contrast, the population in the countryside becomes less. Therefore, there is plenty of space to build houses in the wider area. It seems to be well-relaxed and comfortable to live in a slow-paced lifestyle. But, it is apparently more difficult to obtain a new job, and lacking transport, so they need to rely on cars. In addition, the number of hospitals is much smaller than big cities. These issues are long controversial as a first world problem.Finally, as Covid-19 spread worldwide, many people are started to work at home with a lap top computer. Innumerable companies adopted IT systems that are able to work remotely. In addition, some companies had already stated this systemized working style will not change, however, Covid-19 completely ended. This means that many people do not necessarily need to live in big cities. Therefore, if the transport system is well organized, especially establishing and improving a train, which works faster and more frequently. This effort will be not only helpful to dissipate the population outside of the big cities, but also promotive to tackling with great infrastructures to countrysides.In conclusion, as a result, the densely populated cities will be able to reduce its population and increase the population in the countryside. As a result, some issues will be resolved and become well-balanced solutions. Finally, it might be able to build wider houses in big cities with reasonable prices than now.;In Japan, large cities like Tokyo, Osaka, and Yokohama are known for their tall skyscrapers, while less populated areas tend to have more sprawling development. This disparity in urban planning is understandable given the constraints of space, but it also highlights the need for solutions to distribute the population more evenly across the country.The primary driver of urbanization is the abundance of job opportunities in big cities, which are often home to headquarters of famous companies and international branches. As a result, many people migrate to these cities, leading to the construction of tall apartments and buildings to accommodate the influx of residents. While the dense population can be stressful, the infrastructure in these cities is generally well-organized, with efficient transportation, medical care, and security systems.In contrast, rural areas are experiencing a decline in population, resulting in ample space for building wider homes. The pace of life is slower and more relaxed, but job opportunities are scarce, and residents often rely on cars due to limited transportation options. Moreover, the number of hospitals and other essential services is significantly lower than in urban areas, contributing to longstanding challenges.The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of remote work, with numerous companies implementing IT systems that enable employees to work from home. Many organizations have announced that they will continue to allow remote work even after the pandemic subsides, reducing the need for people to live in big cities. If transportation systems, such as train networks, are improved to be faster and more frequent, it could encourage people to move out of urban areas, alleviating population density and promoting more balanced development in rural areas.In conclusion, by redistributing the population, densely populated cities can reduce their burden, while rural areas can experience growth. This, in turn, can lead to more balanced solutions to existing problems, potentially enabling the construction of more spacious and affordable homes in urban areas. Ultimately, a more evenly distributed population can contribute to a more sustainable and equitable development across Japan.
11;Some countries achieve international sports by building specialised facilities to train top athletes, instead of providing sports facilities that everyone can use. Do you think this is positive or negative development?Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Athletes to be on the top need to have high-end facilities that a country can provide for them to be able to improve their strengths and skills. Some government opted to build facilities exclusively for training athletes for international sports goals, instead of building establishments for everyone to have the liberty of using the sports facilities. From my perspective, this phenomena is a negative development.Being able to discover an individual's potential, they need to have a support from any form of sources. Establishing sports facilities can help people to discover their own interests, talents and even skills in learning new things. Centers which offer utilities, equipments and state-of-the-art tools that provide learning sports can be a great advantage to people who want to train themselves on the things that can awaken their interests when it comes to sports.In addition, building these kind of establishments, not only for the purpose to train top athletes, but also for people to immerse themselves to different variaties of activities can help them socialize more with their peers. This is extremely beneficial that aside from doing sports that they are into, they get to play along with peers, discover one's potential and also learning from one another. Furthermore, these individuals can also have the future to be one of top athletes that a country can have.In conclusion, although there are countries that chose to have their sports establishments exclusively for training top athletes, I assert that these that actions can be lead to negative feedbacks. Government should allow everyone the privilege to use and avail facilities that can hone an individual's talents, skills and dexterity when it comes to sports and this can also be immensely benefical for both country and citizen alike.;To reach the top of their game, athletes require access to high-end facilities that a country can provide, enabling them to enhance their strengths and skills. However, some governments have chosen to construct facilities solely for training athletes with international sports aspirations, rather than building public establishments that everyone can use. From my perspective, this trend is a negative development.Discovering an individual's potential requires support from various sources. Establishing sports facilities can help people discover their interests, talents, and skills, and even facilitate learning new things. Sports centers that offer top-notch utilities, equipment, and tools can provide a significant advantage to individuals who want to explore their interests in sports.Moreover, building such establishments not only serves the purpose of training elite athletes but also allows people to engage in various activities, promoting socialization among peers. This has numerous benefits, as individuals can not only pursue their sports interests but also interact with peers, discover their potential, and learn from one another. Ultimately, these individuals may even become top athletes, benefiting their country.In conclusion, while some countries have opted to reserve their sports facilities exclusively for training top athletes, I firmly believe that this approach can lead to negative consequences. Governments should grant everyone the opportunity to utilize facilities that can hone their talents, skills, and dexterity in sports. This would be immensely beneficial for both the country and its citizens, fostering a more inclusive and supportive environment for athletic development.
725;Some educationalists say that every child should be taught how to play a musical instrument. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;It is commonly known that music has always played an important role in upbringing of children and a lot of parents wish their kids play a musical instrument. However, I disagree that this skill is essential to every pupil.First of all, not all people are born with a talent for music, which is essential if one wants to learn how to play it. Some people are natural musicians and succeed in this sphere with ease. On the other hand, there are children for whom learning to play is a hard work and, eventually, they might start hating music instead of enjoying it. Some people are bound to become excellent engineers or doctors and for them learning to read and play music is just a waste of time.Another important factor is that all kids are different and for that reason each of them desires to have a different hobby. If all pupils spent time on music, those who are not interested in it would have less time on things that are really exciting for them. Undoubtedly, everybody has a right to spend their free time in the way they want.What is more, playing a musical instrument is not considered to be an essential skill for a successful career. More time should be devoted to more important subjects, such as Math, Science and Languages. These have more chance to be useful for people when they grow up and graduate from school.To sum up, teaching all children to play an instrument wouldn't be a good idea. It should be taught only to those who really want it as not only would it ditract a child from subjects and hobbies which are more important in their opinion, but also it cannot be mastered by everybody.;It is often assumed that playing a musical instrument is a vital skill for children to acquire, with many parents hoping their kids will learn to play one. However, I disagree with the notion that this skill is necessary for every student.Firstly, not everyone is naturally inclined towards music, which is a crucial factor in learning to play an instrument. Some individuals are born with a musical talent and excel in this field with ease, while others may find it a daunting task. Forcing these children to learn music could lead to frustration and a dislike for music, rather than fostering an appreciation for it. Moreover, some students are destined for careers in fields like engineering or medicine, where learning to play music would be a waste of time that could be better spent on more relevant pursuits.Another significant consideration is that children are unique individuals with diverse interests and hobbies. If all students were required to dedicate time to music, those who are not enthusiastic about it would have to sacrifice time that could be spent on activities they truly enjoy. Everyone has the right to choose how they spend their free time, and imposing music lessons on all students would undermine this freedom.Furthermore, playing a musical instrument is not a crucial skill for achieving success in a career. In contrast, subjects like mathematics, science, and languages are more likely to be useful to students in their future careers. These subjects should be prioritized, as they provide a more solid foundation for future success.In conclusion, making music lessons mandatory for all children would not be an effective approach. Instead, music education should be reserved for students who have a genuine interest in it, as forcing it upon others could distract them from more important subjects and hobbies, and may lead to frustration and disappointment, given that not everyone has the ability to master a musical instrument.
73;Some experts believe that when a country is already rich, any additional increase in economic wealth does not make its citizens any more satisfied. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;The thought of some experts, is that people from rich countries are not satisfied by an ipotetical increase in their economy. In this essay I will discuss this point of view and I will explain why I am not sure I agree with that.It is generally believed by some professional figures, that additionals rise in economic wealth are not so crucial for a rich coutry. People from countries sush as Japan, the U.S.A, Switzerland or Cina are aware of their wide economic power and these governments offer a lot of benefits for their citizens. Thus, people have yet what they want, such as fundings for projects, well-organized cities, a lot of job opportunities. In fact, they do not fell a significant sense of satisfaction in the increase of their economy.Made this point, it is also true that some surveys used by The Italian University of Parma, reveal that citizens from coutries which a strong economy, are really grateful and satisfied by any additional rise, in the economic sector. As consequence due to this increase, they can ask more fundings for some start up or to improve the technology equipment in schools. Personally, I tend to think as a matter of fact that this is the right view. Because it is logical that more money mean more opportunities in any sector of the country. Hospitals, schools, museum and even historical buildings can have the possibility to obteind a lot of benefits.To conclude, in this essay I discuss the generel view of some experts about people from rich countries. I also explained why I strongly disagree with them.;Some experts argue that people from affluent nations are not significantly satisfied by hypothetical economic growth. In this essay, I will examine this perspective and explain why I have reservations about its validity.It is commonly believed by certain professionals that additional economic growth in wealthy countries is not crucial. Citizens of countries like Japan, the USA, Switzerland, and China are aware of their nations' substantial economic power, and their governments provide numerous benefits. As a result, people's basic needs are met, with access to funding for projects, well-organized cities, and abundant job opportunities. Consequently, they do not experience a significant sense of satisfaction from further economic growth.However, surveys conducted by the University of Parma in Italy suggest that citizens of countries with strong economies are indeed grateful and satisfied with any additional economic growth. This increase enables them to secure more funding for startups or improve technological equipment in schools. Personally, I am inclined to agree with this view, as it stands to reason that more financial resources translate to more opportunities across various sectors. With increased funding, hospitals, schools, museums, and historical buildings can benefit substantially.In conclusion, this essay discusses the general view held by some experts regarding people from rich countries. I have also explained why I strongly disagree with their perspective, arguing instead that economic growth can have a positive impact on various aspects of life in affluent nations.
1061;Some museums and art galleries charge admission fees, while others have free entry.Do you think the advantages of charging for admission outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many artistic places prefer to have an entry fee, whereas others let free access. I fully think that the benefits to have admission fees compensate the drawbacks to be not free.Many individuals would visit museum or art galleries if it were free which could attract more tourists. Unfortunately, admission charge decreases the possibility to discover paintings or masterpieces. However, before being a cultural place, art galleries are a place where numerous employees work. Indeed, if visitors had not to purchase the entrance, workforce would be not paid and the place would be not clean as museum should be. Moreover, huge museums as the British Museum have some sponsors to restore masterpieces whereas small museums have sometimes not the fundings and hence, admission fees would help it. Then, having an entry fee limit the number of individuals who do not really want to see art and appreciate the place.Concerning to cultural places, museum and art galleries know that many households could not afford ticket entrances for their offspring so many museums establish reduced price for teenagers and children. This project improves the relation between young people and the culture, then it allows children to be attracted to culture, partipate to the technical expenses behind the entry fee and after to visit again some cultural places when they will grow up and purchase the full price. Moreover, purchasing tickets help to the economy of the country which sometimes famous cultural places are a significant part of country's income. For instance, admission fees in museum are two third of the tourism's outcome in France.To conclude, I believe that admission fees should outweigh free entrance because it does not let the worth process of museum to work. Even if sometimes admission fees are costly for us, there is always a meaning behind the prices.;Many artistic institutions prefer to charge an entry fee, while others offer free admission. In my opinion, the benefits of having admission fees outweigh the drawbacks of not being free.If museums and art galleries were free, many people would visit, potentially attracting more tourists. However, the absence of an admission fee would limit the discovery of paintings and masterpieces. On the other hand, art galleries are not only cultural institutions, but also workplaces that employ numerous staff members. If visitors were not required to pay an entrance fee, the workforce would not be paid, and the museum would not be maintained to the standard it should be. Furthermore, large museums like the British Museum often have sponsors to restore masterpieces, whereas smaller museums may not have the necessary funding, making admission fees a necessary source of income.Moreover, having an entry fee helps to filter out individuals who are not genuinely interested in art and appreciation, thereby preserving the integrity of the institution. Many museums also offer reduced prices for teenagers and children, making cultural experiences more accessible to young people. This initiative fosters a connection between young people and culture, allowing them to appreciate the value behind the admission fee and potentially leading to repeat visits in the future. Additionally, the revenue generated from ticket sales contributes to the country's economy, with famous cultural institutions often being a significant source of income. For example, admission fees to museums account for two-thirds of the tourism revenue in France.In conclusion, I firmly believe that admission fees are necessary to ensure the proper functioning of museums and art galleries. Although admission fees may seem costly, there is always a justification behind the pricing, and the benefits they provide outweigh the drawbacks of not being free.
1355;Some parents encourage young people to leave home while others think they should stay with the family, discuss and give your opinion;Many parents encourage young people to leave home when they become older, while others think they should stay at home with the family. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.With the tremendous influence of modernisation, remarkable changes have taken place in the family structure to such an extent that nowadays, youngsters are motivated by their parents to live alone as they grow up. However, some people are of the view that it is more practical for a youngster to live with their family.On the one hand, there are many positive aspects to youths living away from their parents at young age. This provides the opportunity to young people to live a life on their own terms and make any decisions without the interference of their parents. Besides, living alone not only makes them independent but also makes them self-reliant, which is a crucial life skill to their successful career. For instance, managing all the house chores such as cleaning, paying bills, cooking and so on will make them well experienced at learning and managing diverse activities and will also boost their confidence.On the other hand, there is no denying the fact that youngsters living away from their family may find themselves in circumstances that may adversely affect their life. Naïve and inexperienced young people in the absence of parental supervision are more likely to fall prey to bad influence and dangerous activities, such as drugs or alcohol consumption, which may jeopardise their career or lead them astray from moral values. However, this situation is less likely to take place with youngsters still living with their parents. Besides, emotional bonding and family relationships can be maintained better if everyone is living together under one roof.In my opinion, although encouraging youngsters to live alone may lead them to learn various life skills, negative aspects and risks associated with living alone can far outweigh the benefits.This response covers the task topic well, by discussing the positive and negative aspects of living alone as a young adult, and the writer’s opinion has also been included. Paragraphing helps to present ideas in an orderly way, and cohesion and coherence are maintained throughout the essay. There is some repetitive use of the word ‘make’ in the first body paragraph, which could have been avoided. Apart from that, the writer’s vocabulary seems to be quite rich and allows them to communicate ideas precisely and clearly. Overall, this essay seems to be worthy of IELTS Band 8.;The debate about whether young adults should live alone or with their families has sparked intense discussion among parents and society as a whole. While some parents encourage their children to leave home as they grow older, others believe it's more practical for them to stay with their family. In this essay, both perspectives will be examined, and my opinion will be provided.On the one hand, there are numerous advantages to young people living away from their parents at a young age. This allows them to lead a life on their own terms, making decisions without parental interference. Living alone fosters independence and self-reliance, essential life skills for a successful career. For example, managing household chores like cleaning, paying bills, and cooking enables them to gain experience in handling diverse tasks, thereby boosting their confidence.On the other hand, it cannot be denied that young adults living away from their family may encounter situations that could negatively impact their lives. Naive and inexperienced youths, lacking parental supervision, are more susceptible to negative influences and dangerous activities, such as drug or alcohol consumption. These behaviors could jeopardize their career or lead them astray from moral values. In contrast, youngsters living with their parents are less likely to face such circumstances. Moreover, emotional bonds and family relationships are better maintained when everyone lives together under one roof.In my opinion, although encouraging young adults to live alone may help them acquire various life skills, the negative aspects and risks associated with living alone outweigh the benefits. This is because the potential for young adults to be led astray and engage in harmful activities is higher when they live alone, compared to the benefits of independence and self-reliance.This response effectively covers the topic by discussing both the positive and negative aspects of young adults living alone, and the writer's opinion is clearly stated. The essay is well-organized, with each paragraph presenting ideas in a logical and coherent manner. The writer's vocabulary is rich and effectively communicates their ideas with precision and clarity. Overall, this essay deserves an IELTS Band 8 score.
1335;Some people believe that excessive use of modern technologies, such as computers and smartphones, is negatively affecting the reading and writing skills of our young people. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;"Parents and teachers in many countries are feeling increasingly concerned about the effect of digital devices on vital skills of school-aged children. They are alarmed by the declining ability of young people to read and write and its suspected link to the influence of modern technology, and I wholeheartedly share their view. This essay will outline the reasons to watch out for the consequences of widespread use of computers and mobile phones by our youngsters.Primary school is a very important period when children develop their fine motor skills, which are involved in learning to write. Time spent typing on a mobile phone or a tablet doesn’t contribute to the necessary workout of the small muscles in the hands and fingers of young people. Not only do they get less practice in writing but also fewer opportunities to train in spelling words, since the ‘autocorrect’ and ‘autocomplete’ features use the first few letters to guess the entire word, therefore making it unnecessary for the child to remember and type it correctly. Another companion of unrestrained use of mobile devices is the jargon that is often used in text messages, where words are shortened or distorted. Exposure to ‘texting’ tends to replace the correct words with abbreviations in young minds, causing their spelling accuracy to decline.Reading is another casualty of unrestricted access to smart devices. Video content can be more appealing and immersive for kids and they often are automatically drawn to it instead of books. Reading requires regular practice and needs to become a habit in order to fully develop as a skill; however, it is being perceived as a boring and labourious activity by many youngsters compared to effortless video-watching. Easy and instant access to videos and movies pushes books further down the list of preferences of young audience, and it takes a significant commitment from parents and teachers to ensure that children continue to read books.To sum up, modern technology can be a friend or a foe for young children, depending on the choices adults in their lives make, regulating the amount of screen time and its purpose. Without due care the writing and reading abilities of kids can be harmed by other, more enjoyable activities they can use the devices for.";The widespread use of digital devices among school-aged children has sparked concern among parents and teachers worldwide about the potential impact on essential skills. The decline in reading and writing abilities, possibly linked to the influence of modern technology, is a worrying trend that I strongly agree with. This essay will discuss the reasons why the excessive use of computers and mobile phones by children should be monitored.The primary school years are crucial for developing fine motor skills, which are necessary for learning to write. However, spending time typing on mobile phones or tablets does not provide the necessary exercise for the small muscles in the hands and fingers of young people. As a result, children not only have fewer opportunities to practice writing, but they also have limited chances to train in spelling words due to the 'autocorrect' and 'autocomplete' features, which predict the entire word based on the first few letters. Furthermore, the unchecked use of mobile devices often leads to the use of jargon and abbreviations commonly found in text messages, which can replace correct words in young minds and decrease spelling accuracy.Reading is also being negatively impacted by the unrestrained access to smart devices. Children often find video content more engaging and immersive, and as a result, they tend to prefer it over reading books. To develop reading skills, regular practice is necessary, but many youngsters perceive reading as a boring and laborious activity compared to the effortless act of watching videos. The easy access to videos and movies further diminishes the appeal of reading, making it essential for parents and teachers to encourage children to read books and limit their screen time.In conclusion, modern technology can be either beneficial or harmful to young children, depending on the guidance provided by adults. If not regulated, screen time can lead to a decline in writing and reading abilities, as children may prefer more enjoyable activities on devices. It is crucial for parents and teachers to monitor and control the amount of screen time and its purpose to ensure that children develop essential skills without being negatively impacted by technology.
877;Some people believe that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime. Others believe that there are better ways to reduce crime. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;The increasing number of criminals are appeared in a society where some people advocate the longer incarceration resulting in a reduction of crime. However, some are divided and think that a number of better ways can help lessen the cases of crime. Which strategy should be taken to tackle this problem? This essay attempts to explore the view of both sides.An increase in the rate of crimes is a raising concerns in the community. A longer prison sentence seems to be the straightforward method to impede the crimes caused. In fact, a continuous incarceration is no room for offenders to commit the crimes in the community. This seemingly becomes an immediate achievement in the short term period. Some people deeply believe the mindset of criminals can be eliminated by the deterrence effect of the longer sentences which deprive of a person's freedom in life. In addition, it is generally recognized that the offenders have to be punished in effect of their guilty acts. The outlaws deserve a lengthening prison term in which they repent their offenses resulting in a decline in the number of crimes.Indeed, the incarceration can limit the offender's actions in a place at some points. However, it is not difficult to find there is a higher rate of reoffending upon release from prison across the countries. In 2013, the U.S.A. had a reoffending rate of 52% which prisoners reoffended within a year of release with a record of 49.2% in the U.K. The proportion of reoffenders occupied nearly a half of criminals. It reveals that the prison sentences is not a effective way to decrease the number of criminal cases. This implies that a decline in the crimes can be achieved araising from a decline in the likelihood of reoffending. Rehabilitation during the course of their sentence can be adopted to tackle this problems. These include direct therapeutic interventions to address the psychological causes of criminal behaviours as well as services to prepare offenderes to successfully reintegrate into the community after release. Those actions include the provision of academic programmes, vocational courses and employment opportunities.My take on this is that the incarceration alone is rarely considered enough in the control of criminal cases. A longer prison term only increase the financial cost from the government, but it cannot lower the likelihood of criminal offenses. The governments have to address the root factors causing offenses is the prime issue to reduce the crimes.;The rise in criminal activity has sparked a debate about the most effective way to reduce crime rates. Some argue that longer prison sentences are the solution, as they believe that this approach will deter criminals and prevent them from committing further crimes. On the other hand, others are divided on the issue and think that there are better ways to tackle crime. This essay aims to examine both perspectives.One approach to reducing crime is to impose longer prison sentences, which seems like a straightforward solution. By keeping offenders incarcerated, they are unable to commit crimes in the community, at least in the short term. Some people believe that the threat of longer sentences will deter criminals and eliminate their desire to commit crimes. Additionally, many think that offenders should be punished for their actions, and that a longer prison term will give them time to reflect on their mistakes and reduce the likelihood of reoffending.However, while incarceration can limit an offender's actions, the reality is that there is a high rate of reoffending upon release from prison. In 2013, the United States had a reoffending rate of 52%, with 49.2% in the United Kingdom. This suggests that prison sentences alone are not an effective way to decrease crime rates. Instead, a decline in crime rates can be achieved by reducing the likelihood of reoffending. To address this, rehabilitation programs can be implemented during an offender's sentence, including therapeutic interventions to address the psychological causes of criminal behavior and services to prepare offenders for successful reintegration into society after release. These programs can include academic courses, vocational training, and employment opportunities.In conclusion, incarceration alone is often insufficient to control crime rates. Longer prison terms only increase the financial burden on governments without reducing the likelihood of criminal offenses. To effectively reduce crime rates, governments must address the root causes of crime. By providing rehabilitation programs and support services, offenders can be helped to reintegrate into society and reduce the likelihood of reoffending, ultimately leading to a decline in crime rates.
379;Some people believe that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?;This essay agrees on the need of that governments should pay full course fees for students who want to study in universities, but always under one premise: those students should have demonstrated their capability to comply with university studies successfully.There are countries, for example Scandinavian countries, where their government helps students by giving them specific students' loans. These loans have special characteristics such as long loan terms and low interest rates. It is not for free, but at least a higher number of students can have access to upgrade their studies.And in many other European countries university fees are not large, so most of the students can access to bachelor studies. What it's not easy is having the needed qualification you need to access to the specific university study you want.If we talk in worlwide terms, university studies are limited to wealthy people.In fact I read only a couple of weeks ago that only a 17% of worlds' population have university studies. There is a contradiction between developped and non developped countries. As an example, in most countries in Europe we have too many university students. Actually they cannot find a job easily at their own country and sometimes they emigrate to another country in Europe or outside Europe. Furthermore vocational workers such as plumbers, waiters or receptionists can't be found, there no unemployment in vocational work!.The opposite happens in non developped countries. As university studies have large fees, almost nobody can access to them, and vocational workers suffer unemployment, so they need to emigrate to other countries to find jobs.To summarize, I believe fees should not be an obstacle to study in a university. The obstable should be your previous califications.Education and Health, as much as a country can hold them, should be available for all population, poor and wealthy, with non differentiation.;This essay argues that governments should cover the full cost of university tuition for students who demonstrate the ability to succeed in higher education. However, this support should come with the condition that students have already shown their capacity to excel in university studies.In some countries, such as those in Scandinavia, governments offer student loans with favorable terms, including lengthy repayment periods and low interest rates. While these loans are not interest-free, they do make it possible for a larger number of students to pursue higher education.In many European countries, university fees are relatively low, making it easier for students to access bachelor's degree programs. The challenge lies in meeting the necessary qualifications to gain admission to the desired program.On a global scale, university education is largely reserved for those from wealthy backgrounds. In fact, it was recently reported that only 17% of the world's population has access to university education, highlighting the disparity between developed and developing nations. In Europe, there is an oversaturation of university graduates, leading to unemployment and emigration to other countries in search of job opportunities. Conversely, there is a shortage of skilled vocational workers, such as plumbers, waiters, and receptionists, resulting in zero unemployment in these fields.In contrast, developing countries face the opposite issue. The high cost of university education means that few can afford it, while vocational workers struggle with unemployment, forcing them to emigrate to find work.In conclusion, I firmly believe that financial constraints should not hinder access to university education. Instead, admission should be based on a student's prior academic achievements. Education and healthcare are fundamental rights that should be available to all, regardless of economic status, and governments should strive to provide these essential services to their populations without discrimination.
1428;Some people believe that having a pet such as a cat or a dog helps old people to live a more enjoyable life and to stay healthier. How do you think old people benefit from having a pet? Do you think there are any problems related to old people who have pets?;, and indeed, the importance of relationship between human beings and their pets has been proved to be slightly exaggerated in some nations. However, although problems regarding may affect the health conditions of old people, the benefits that these lovely animals bring to them, physically and mentally alike, are clearly undeniable.In of physical benefits, the well-being of elderly people with pets compared to those without pets, since not only do they have to take care of themselves, the responsibility ensure their one fed and well looked after encourages them to become even more active. Due to these extra activities, this might not have an obvious influence on their health, but at least this could help them to avoid bad . Coupled with physical side, their mental wellbeing will also be improved, and the reason is that having someone to take care of would reduce the chance of feeling . Therefore, their could be minimised.In spite of the above advantages, the interaction between pets and vulnerable old people still exist. One of the major concerns is the of these animal on their tracheas, especially those asthma. virtually invisible in the air, many asthma symptoms are caused unconsciously by pets. In addition to the fact that old people might experience difficulty in looking after their pets, as their health conditions are limited, could become even more when they try take care of others.In conclusion, it is true that obstacles still exist for elderly people in adopting pets, but the benefits of this topic its . For such reasons, instead of , further support would be far more beneficial.;The significance of the relationship between humans and their pets has been somewhat overstated in certain countries. Nevertheless, despite potential issues that may impact the health of older adults, the physical and mental benefits that pets bring to them are unmistakable. In terms of physical benefits, the well-being of elderly individuals with pets is superior to those without pets. This is because caring for a pet encourages them to become more active, as they must not only look after themselves but also ensure their pet is fed and well cared for. Although this increased activity may not have an obvious impact on their health, it can at least help them avoid unhealthy habits. Additionally, their mental wellbeing will also improve, as having a pet to care for reduces the likelihood of feeling lonely. Consequently, their emotional distress can be minimized.Despite these advantages, concerns about the interaction between pets and vulnerable older adults still exist. A major concern is the impact of pets on their respiratory health, particularly for those with asthma. The virtually invisible allergens in the air can unconsciously trigger asthma symptoms. Furthermore, older adults may struggle to care for their pets due to their limited health, which can become even more challenging when they try to care for others.In conclusion, while obstacles still exist for elderly people adopting pets, the benefits of pet ownership far outweigh them. Therefore, instead of discouraging pet adoption, providing further support would be more beneficial.
1300;Some people believe that homework should not be given to school children. Others, however, say that homework is an important requirement for children to be able to develop appropriately. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The benefits of giving or not giving homework to children are often debated. Some people feel that children have enough work to do during one day whilst at school, whereas others feel that the more work set, the better.It is true that schools today place more and more demands and pressure on children. The competition to do well, to enter a good university and to get a good job is significant. This has led to the ideology that children should do as much schoolwork as possible in order to help their intellectual development. The argument, however, that more is better is not always valid. There comes a point, especially for a child, when more knowledge cannot be absorbed in a day. When a child has possibly 7 or 8 classes a day on different subjects, he or she is processing a lot of information already. To give more work to be done at home, therefore, would be pointless and even counterproductive. In addition to this, although it is important to be educated, childhood should also be a time when there is an opportunity to just play and enjoy unstructured time. Homework can significantly lessen the possibilities of doing this.On the other hand, it can be argued that there is a place for homework. If study at school is not overdone, the opportunity to look at work again and extend ideas can be an invaluable exercise. It’s easy to forget one thing that has been taught once, but if that concept is revisited a second time, the brain has time to reprocess and likely better understand and remember.It seems to me that there is a place for homework for today’s children. What must be remembered, though, is that homework needs to be limited to age-appropriate parameters, so that a balance can be struck between study and free time and relaxation.;"The debate about whether or not to assign homework to children has sparked intense discussion. On one hand, some individuals believe that the school day already provides sufficient workload, while others argue that more assignments lead to better academic outcomes. It is undeniable that modern schools impose significant demands and pressure on children, with the ultimate goal of securing a spot at a prestigious university and landing a well-paying job. This has led to the notion that children should engage in as much academic work as possible to foster intellectual growth. However, the assumption that ""more is better"" is not always accurate. There is a limit to the amount of information a child can absorb in a day, especially when they have 7 or 8 classes on various subjects. Adding homework to their already packed schedule can be counterproductive and unnecessary. Furthermore, childhood should be a time for play, unstructured activities, and enjoyment, all of which can be hindered by excessive homework. On the other hand, homework can be beneficial when used judiciously. If school study is kept in balance, revisiting concepts at home can be a valuable exercise, allowing the brain to reprocess and solidify understanding. This can help prevent the forgetting of previously taught material and promote better retention. In my opinion, homework has its place in the lives of modern children, but it is crucial to set age-appropriate limits to strike a balance between academic work, free time, and relaxation. This balance is essential to ensure that children can reap the benefits of homework without sacrificing their childhood and overall well-being."
1369;Some people believe that preserving natural environment is crucial, but make no effort to do so (reasons and solutions);Some people believe that preserving natural environment is crucial, however, most make no effort to do so. Why do you think this is happening? What are some simple actions that could help the environment?It is commonly believed that preservation of natural resources is imperative, yet most people seem to exert no effort in doing so. Understanding the causes of this negligent attitude may help with devising some simple measures to safeguard the deteriorating environment.Lack of awareness is probably the foremost reason why the vast majority of individuals appears to be unmindful of the current environmental issues. Normally, people have tendency to downplay abstract problems, or those to happen in the distant future. This is because they are not properly informed of the possible detrimental effects of taking the environment for granted. To illustrate, residents in urban areas often deliberately dump their into the nearby creeks and drainage canals causing them to become clogged. It is only when devastating floods strike, that they come to realize the consequences of their actions.Some basic solutions that could be carried out are extensive awareness through all forms of communication and strict implementation of waste management. In addition to the traditional press, social media is a powerful means of disseminating information regarding the impending disasters and their potential hazards. This is a good way of persuading the public to actively take part in the campaign. Another straightforward solution, and by far the least anyone can do to help save the nature is disposing of garbage thoughtfully. Apart from avoiding throwing trash anywhere, everyone should practice proper segregation of biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and recyclable wastes at all times. These actions, when coordinated by the local governments, can be tremendously successful.In conclusion, while individual awareness is key to maintaining a healthy ecosystem, concerted efforts of governments and are much more effective in achieving such goal.The response is well written, it contains reasons, solutions and fully addresses the task. The ideas aren’t repeated, they are conveyed in a clear and easy to understand manner and organised well with sufficient use of cohesive devices. The vocabulary is varied, sentence structures are complex and instances of incorrect grammar are hardly noticeable. Overall, this essay is likely to achieve Band 8 in IELTS.;Many people acknowledge the importance of preserving the natural environment, yet few take action to protect it. What do you think is the reason behind this disparity? What simple steps can be taken to mitigate environmental degradation?It is widely accepted that preserving natural resources is essential, but most individuals seem to make little effort to do so. Understanding the reasons behind this apathy may help in devising simple measures to safeguard the deteriorating environment.A lack of awareness is likely the primary reason why most people appear to be oblivious to current environmental issues. Typically, individuals tend to downplay abstract problems or those that occur in the distant future, as they are not adequately informed about the potential detrimental effects of neglecting the environment. For instance, urban residents often deliberately dump waste into nearby waterways, causing them to become clogged.

Another straightforward solution, and the least that anyone can do to help preserve the environment, is disposing of garbage thoughtfully. This entails avoiding littering and practicing proper segregation of biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and recyclable wastes at all times. When coordinated by local governments, these actions can be highly effective.In conclusion, while individual awareness is crucial for maintaining a healthy ecosystem, concerted efforts by governments and individuals are far more effective in achieving this goal.
1322;Some people believe that the best way to solve environmental problems is to increase the price of fuel.Do you agree or disagree?;"Raising the price of car fuel is believed by some people to be an excellent method to solve the growing number of environmental issues. However, I strongly disagree with this idea, as doing so would make life difficult for lower-income households. While making fuel more expensive wouldn’t change the habits of wealthy families, switching to fossil fuel alternatives could prove to be much more beneficial for the environment.The most compelling reason against raising the cost of fuel is that the upper classes of society will hardly be affected by rising fuel costs, as this only makes up a minor proportion of their expenditure. They will continue to use their personal vehicles as they wish without a thought for the environment or the higher fuel prices, even if their country has state-of-the-art public transportation.Those who will feel the crunch of this decision are the middle-class and lower-income households, since travelling is a major part of most people’s routine, be it to work, school or shopping. Driving is almost unavoidable in many instances; therefore, raising the price of petrol would only serve to widen the gap between the rich and poor, and serve as an inadvertent form of discrimination.Another reason why increasing the cost of fuel is far from the best way to deal with environmental pollution is that now there are much more viable alternatives. Due to the rapid advances in technology, scientists and engineers have been able to develop several alternatives to fossil fuel, such as cars powered by electricity or naturally produced biofuel. The move to adopt clean energy sources instead of fossil fuels is a much more promising alternative compared to simply making fuel more expensive.In conclusion, I believe that governments of the world should invest more time and money in finding alternatives to fossil fuels that are more environmentally friendly, rather than simply raising the cost of petrol.";Some individuals propose that increasing the cost of car fuel is an effective solution to address the escalating environmental concerns. However, I firmly oppose this notion, as it would disproportionately burden lower-income households. Raising fuel prices would not alter the behavior of affluent families, who would continue to use their vehicles without concern for the environment or the increased costs, even in areas with advanced public transportation systems. In contrast, switching to alternative energy sources could have a more significant positive impact on the environment.The primary argument against hiking fuel costs is that it would have a negligible effect on the wealthy, as fuel expenses constitute a minor portion of their overall expenditure. On the other hand, middle-class and lower-income households would be severely impacted, as commuting is a crucial aspect of daily life, including traveling to work, school, or stores. Driving is often unavoidable, and increasing fuel prices would only serve to exacerbate the socioeconomic divide and inadvertently discriminate against those who are already economically disadvantaged.Furthermore, with the rapid advancements in technology, there are now more viable and environmentally friendly alternatives to fossil fuels. Scientists and engineers have developed innovative options, such as electric cars and biofuels produced from natural sources. Adopting clean energy sources is a more promising strategy than simply increasing fuel prices. In conclusion, I firmly believe that governments should focus their efforts and resources on developing and implementing alternatives to fossil fuels that are more environmentally sustainable, rather than relying on price hikes as a solution to environmental pollution. This approach would be more effective in mitigating the negative impact of fossil fuels on the environment, while also being more equitable and considerate of the economic realities faced by lower-income households.
1273;Some people believe that we cannot learn anything from the past for our life today, while others believe that history is a valuable source of information to understand human's life.Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is true that these days people say there is little we can gain from previous history, whereas others think that history is a key source to understand our lives. Although there are some strong arguments against learning history, I agree with learning history to know life of human.There are two reasons why people think there is nothing to gain from history. Firstly, there is evidence to support the idea that learning history stresses people out. Based on a survey conducted by Standford University, 57 percent of people consider learning past life of humans a primary source of stress, while less than 6 percent of people said studying previous humans' life was not a stressor. Secondly, people may not have time to remember historical events because the constant stimulation and hustle and bustle of society is holding them back from their life. In turn, they are more likely to regard learning history as useless.Despite the negative drawbacks, I support that historical event is great information to comprehend human's life. The main benefit of a historical event is that it can have a positive impact on people, especially children, as they grow up. Since history has more connection and support to our lives, it allows children to become more insightful and knowledgeable and discover advanced perspectives. For example, I have been widening my perspective through historical events in my family or country because gaining history regarding my family and nation taught me the right attitude to understand today. However, if I did not know any history, I would not have had an opportunity to understand human life and self-development. So, learning history should be encouraged.In conclusion, while I recognize the possible disadvantages of learning history, I believe that the benefits of gaining past events far outweigh them in the long term.;The value of learning from history has become a topic of debate in recent times. Some people argue that history has little to offer in terms of useful knowledge, while others believe it is essential for understanding our lives. Although there are valid arguments against studying history, I firmly believe that it is crucial for gaining insight into human life.There are two primary reasons why some individuals think that history has no practical value. Firstly, research suggests that learning about historical events can be a significant source of stress. A survey conducted by Stanford University found that 57% of respondents considered learning about the past to be a major stressor, whereas less than 6% reported that it was not a source of stress. Secondly, the fast pace of modern society, with its constant distractions and demands, can make it difficult for people to find the time to learn about historical events, leading them to view history as unnecessary.Despite these drawbacks, I strongly advocate for the importance of learning from historical events. One of the main advantages of studying history is its potential to positively impact individuals, particularly children, as they develop and grow. History provides a deeper understanding of our lives, allowing children to become more informed, insightful, and nuanced in their perspectives. For instance, my own understanding of historical events related to my family and country has broadened my perspective and taught me valuable lessons about the right attitude towards life. Without this knowledge, I would have missed out on the opportunity to understand human life and personal development. Therefore, learning history should be actively promoted.In conclusion, while acknowledging the potential downsides of learning history, I am convinced that the long-term benefits of acquiring knowledge about past events far exceed the drawbacks. History is a rich source of information that can empower us with the insight and understanding necessary to navigate our lives effectively.
1342;Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military, while others disagree (opinion);Some people believe that women should be treated as equal to men when applying for a job with the police or the military. Others think that women are less suitable for this kind of job. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Sample EssayIn recent years gender equality in employment has been the topic of heated debate. While some may argue that women are less suited for certain jobs such as with the police or the military, I believe that female candidates should be treated the same as their male counterparts.Those who consider women to be unsuited for some kinds of jobs including the police or the military often hold that opinion because such jobs are extremely physically demanding. As the female body has smaller muscles and less physical strength compared to male body, women may have difficulty engaging in strenuous activity which can be exhausting even for men. In military service, female soldiers are more likely to struggle while defending themselves than their male peers when they are forced to move around carrying heavy firearms in the battle, which can increase their risk of mission failure. Because of the hazards and extreme conditions they may encounter, some people advocate that women are not suitable for work in these fields.Nevertheless, I believe that female applicants should be considered for police or military placements without a gender bias, because women are more suited to certain tasks. In the police service, female officers can perform important roles on some occasions such as a body search where male officers are restricted from touching female convicts. In the military service, female nursing staff are more likely to care better for injured soldiers since maternal instinct makes them dedicated and heart-warming professionals. Furthermore, for the sake of fairness to all, job seekers should have an equal opportunity to choose their jobs freely, regardless of gender. Many women have the desire to work in the police and the military and some of them have relevant expertise and qualifications. Therefore, they should not be discriminated against in employment opportunities for these jobs.In conclusion, although some say that women are incompatible with police and military duties because of the high physical demands, I believe that they should be treated as equal to men. This is because there are certain roles with the police and the military that are more suitable for women than men, and therefore both genders should have equal employment opportunities.;The notion that women should be treated equally to men when applying for positions in the police force or the military is a contentious issue. On one hand, some individuals argue that women are less suited for these roles due to the physically demanding nature of the jobs. On the other hand, others believe that female candidates should be given equal consideration as their male counterparts. In this essay, both perspectives will be discussed, and a personal viewpoint will be presented.The argument that women are not suitable for certain jobs, such as those in the police or military, often stems from the belief that these professions require a high level of physical strength and endurance. Proponents of this view point out that the female body, with its smaller muscles and lower physical strength compared to the male body, may struggle with the strenuous activities often required in these fields. For instance, in military combat situations, female soldiers might face greater challenges in defending themselves while carrying heavy firearms, potentially increasing the risk of mission failure. Due to the hazardous conditions and extreme environments associated with these jobs, some advocate for the exclusion of women from these roles.However, it is essential to consider that female applicants bring unique strengths and abilities to the table, making them highly suited for certain tasks within the police and military services. For example, in police work, female officers are often better positioned to handle situations such as body searches of female suspects, where male officers may be restricted due to privacy concerns. Similarly, in military settings, female nursing staff often provide superior care to injured soldiers, leveraging their nurturing instincts to deliver dedicated and compassionate service. Moreover, the principle of fairness dictates that job seekers should have equal opportunities to choose their careers without gender bias. Many women possess the desire, relevant expertise, and qualifications to excel in the police and military, and thus, they should not face discrimination in employment opportunities for these roles.In conclusion, although the physically demanding nature of police and military jobs may lead some to believe that women are less compatible with these duties, it is crucial to recognize the valuable contributions women can make in these fields. Given the specific roles within the police and military that are more suited to women's skills and strengths, and the importance of equal employment opportunities, it is reasonable to treat female candidates with the same consideration as their male counterparts. Ultimately, embracing gender equality in these professions not only aligns with the principles of fairness and equality but also enriches these services with a diverse range of skills and perspectives.
1376;Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research (discuss);Some people claim that it is acceptable to use animals in medical research for the benefit of human beings, while others argue that it is wrong. Discuss both views and give your opinion.People have different views on how medical research should be conducted and tested. Although many people support the use of for developing medicines, I personally believe that animal testing is morally wrong.The main reason why some people value to conduct medical research is because animal testing has contributed to many life-saving cures and treatments. It is true that nearly every medical breakthrough in the last 100 years has resulted directly from research using animals. For example, experiments in which dogs had their pancreases removed led directly to the discovery of insulin, critical to saving the lives of diabetics. Furthermore, it is impossible to release to the market before proving it no harm to humans and laboratory mice are appropriate research subjects because they are similar to human beings in many ways.However, I people who consider medical development that involved the use of animals cruel and unacceptable. I believe that the lives of all creatures should be respected and we, humans, have no right to for our own benefits. Governments should invest in developing alternative methods that can replace when doing medical research. For example, a software program can be developed to model a human immune system and new drugs can be tested on the software rather than animals. In this way, no animals will suffer from the medical tests and the society can still benefit from medical development.In conclusion, although it is undoubtedly true that animal testing has helped scientists in drug developments and medical discoveries, I believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused to animals and we should use alternative methods when doing medical research that do not involve animals suffering.This is a great essay. It addresses the two sides of the argument by exploring reasons why animals should and should not be used in medical research. The ideas are well explained and supported by examples. The use of paragraphing is efficient and helps with logical sequencing of ideas. Linking words are used appropriately to achieve the necessary cohesion. Author’s meaning is skillfully conveyed by the use of wide range of vocabulary. Even though there are some inaccurately used expressions, they don’t hinder understanding. Most sentences are error-free, instances of faulty grammar are rare. Overall, this essay seems worthy of IELTS Band 8.;The debate on whether animals should be used in medical research for the benefit of human beings is a contentious issue, with some people advocating for its acceptance and others vehemently opposing it. This essay aims to discuss both perspectives and provide an opinion on the matter.On one hand, proponents of animal testing in medical research argue that it is a necessary evil, given the significant contributions it has made to the development of life-saving medicines and treatments. Over the past century, nearly every major medical breakthrough has been a direct result of research conducted on animals. For instance, experiments involving dogs that had their pancreases removed led to the discovery of insulin, a crucial hormone for saving the lives of diabetics. Moreover, before any drug can be released to the market, it must be proven safe for human consumption, and laboratory mice, due to their biological similarities to humans, serve as suitable test subjects.On the other hand, there are those who consider the use of animals in medical development to be cruel and unacceptable. This perspective is rooted in the belief that all living beings' lives should be respected, and humans have no inherent right to exploit animals for their own benefits. Instead, governments should invest in developing alternative research methods that can replace animal testing. For example, software programs can be designed to simulate the human immune system, allowing new drugs to be tested virtually rather than on living creatures. This approach would eradicate animal suffering from medical tests while still enabling society to reap the benefits of medical advancements.In conclusion, while it is undeniable that animal testing has played a pivotal role in drug development and medical discoveries, the suffering it inflicts on animals cannot be justified by the benefits it provides to humans. Therefore, alternative methods that do not involve animal suffering should be employed in medical research. This stance is based on the ethical consideration that the lives of all creatures should be treated with respect and dignity, and that human innovation should strive to find compassionate solutions that benefit both humans and animals alike.This essay effectively presents a balanced view of the argument, exploring reasons both for and against the use of animals in medical research. The ideas are clearly articulated and supported with relevant examples, demonstrating a thoughtful and informed perspective on the issue. The use of paragraphs enhances the logical flow of ideas, and linking words contribute to the essay's cohesion. The author's message is conveyed through a varied and adept use of vocabulary, making the essay engaging and persuasive. While minor inaccuracies in expression are present, they do not detract from the overall understanding of the text. Most sentences are grammatically correct,
1057;Some people feel that entertainers such as film stars, pop musicians or sports stars are paid too much money.Do you agree or disagree?Which other types of job should be highly paid?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Jobs such as actors, musicians or athlete earns a lot of money, however, a part of people argued that these kinds of people are overpaid. In my opinion, I disagree with this view and believes that they deserved the high salary.People who works as a movie stars, musicians and sports player deserved high money paid. This is because they advocated all there time and effort to get the salary that they have today. Before they become famous, they only have few incomes or even get nothing. That is to say, many musicians did not get any payment at the begining of their career, so do the actors and sports players, they spent their time but do not get any money. For instance, before being a well-known musicians, they have to spend their own money on buying equipment to produce musics or to public the songs they have made. Also, the creativety and their works cannot be measured by money. Thus, they deserved high salary because of their profession and uncopyable works.Jobs which needs professional skills and the job envolves high risk shoul also be highly paid. Such as doctors and programmers, their job are unplaceable because these envolved professional knowledge that not everyone had. Moreover, people works in high-risk environment deserved high payment too. For example, fire-fighters, they might got hurt or even die while working. Therefore, higher salary is needed for jobs that need special skills and career with high risk.To sum up, I agree with the statement because of the reasons above, and jobs with special knowledge and people works in dangerous environment should also be highly paid.;Certain professions, such as acting, music, and athletics, are often associated with high salaries. However, some people argue that individuals in these fields are overpaid. I disagree with this perspective and believe that they deserve their lucrative compensation.Professionals like movie stars, musicians, and athletes earn high salaries because they have dedicated tremendous time and effort to achieve their current status. Before gaining fame, many of these individuals had limited or no income. For instance, budding musicians often spend their own money on equipment and promotional materials to produce and share their music. Similarly, actors and athletes invest significant time and resources into their craft without immediate financial reward. The creativity and uniqueness of their work cannot be measured solely by monetary value. Therefore, their high salaries are justified by the value they bring to their profession and the originality of their work.Furthermore, jobs that require specialized skills and involve high risks should also be highly compensated. Professions like doctors and programmers possess expertise that not everyone possesses, making their work invaluable. Additionally, individuals who work in high-risk environments, such as firefighters, deserve higher pay due to the dangers they face on the job. The risk of injury or death is a significant factor that warrants higher salaries for these brave individuals.In conclusion, I firmly believe that certain professions, particularly those requiring specialized knowledge and involving high risks, warrant high salaries. The value, effort, and risks associated with these jobs justify the compensation they receive, and I agree that these individuals deserve to be well-paid for their work.
1289;Some people feel that fashion is like art and a significant part of society, while others feel that fashion is a waste of time and money.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"The fashion industry today is an important component of society and people’s lives. It is true that many people care little for clothes and scorn the importance that others attach to them; however, this does not mean that the significance that people give to fashion is a waste of time and money.When one considers that areas of the world suffer from poverty, disease and inadequate access to food and clean water, the emphasis attached to fashion by the developed world can seem out of proportion. Many people would contend that the resources put into developing and creating fashion would be more ethically spent on creating some level of equality in terms of the right to live a healthy and happy life. This point is hard to argue with. However, it is also true that people in the developed world cannot be expected to send all their spending money to people in need and that wanting to look good is an unalterable human trait.The fashion industry contributes to the society much like most other industries. It provides jobs and income to millions of people around the world and the money that changes hands generates taxes that contribute to the fabric of society. There is more to fashion than trying to look better than others and excessive luxury. The high level of fashion is indeed a kind of art form and, like other art forms, there will always be people who appreciate it, want to create it and want to spend money on it. It is part of the development of civilisation and this is not likely to change.I therefore feel that, although the gap between the rich and the poor sometimes makes it seem that fashion is a waste of time and money and an unethical use of resources, fashion is an important part of today’s society and economic output. This leads me to believe that trying to strike a balance between selfish greed and a more altruistic way of living should be an individual choice.";"The fashion industry is a significant aspect of modern society, playing a substantial role in people's lives. While some individuals may not prioritize clothing or view the emphasis on fashion as excessive, this does not necessarily mean that the importance attached to fashion is frivolous or a waste of resources. It is understandable that, given the existence of poverty, disease, and inadequate access to basic necessities like food and clean water in certain parts of the world, the attention and resources devoted to fashion in the developed world may seem disproportionate. Many argue that the funds invested in fashion could be better spent on addressing global inequalities and ensuring that everyone has the right to a healthy and happy life - a viewpoint that is difficult to dispute. However, it is also reasonable to acknowledge that individuals in the developed world cannot be expected to allocate all their discretionary income towards charity, as the desire to present oneself well is an inherent human trait.The fashion industry, like many others, contributes significantly to society. It is a source of employment and income for millions globally, and the economic activity it generates contributes to the societal fabric through taxation. Fashion encompasses more than mere competition for appearance or luxury; high-end fashion can be considered an art form, appreciated and supported by those who value it. As with other art forms, there will always be individuals who wish to create, appreciate, and invest in it. This aspect of human expression and creativity is an integral part of civilization's evolution, and it is unlikely to diminish.In conclusion, although the disparity between the rich and the poor may lead some to view fashion as an unnecessary indulgence and an unethical allocation of resources, I believe that fashion remains a vital component of contemporary society and economic activity. This perspective leads me to the conclusion that finding a balance between personal indulgence and altruism should be a matter of individual choice, allowing people to navigate their own path between contributing to the greater good and participating in the aspects of society, like fashion, that bring them personal fulfillment and expression."
1294;Some people feel that learning a foreign language is an essential component of a child’s education. Others feel that learning a foreign language is often a waste of time that can be better spent on learning about technology and other more vocational subjects.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Throughout the history of education, learning a foreign language or languages has been a constant component. Of course, many people feel that this is really an unnecessary part of education for everyone, but this is not a point of view that I share.The opponents to learning a foreign language might argue that most people do not travel that often outside their own country. In addition to this, out of all the countries of the world, comparatively not many share the same language. Therefore, learning a foreign language will only be useful for the very limited time that one spends in a country where this language is used. For some people, the language might never be used in their entire lives. When one thinks about how much time and money are spent training language teachers, buying resources, going on trips and delivering lessons for such a negligible benefit, this would seem to be a very inefficient allocation of resources.However, the benefits of learning a foreign language go further than just the ability to use it from time to time on a holiday or business trip. Firstly, through learning one language, one gains an understanding to some extent of how all languages work. Thus, no matter where people might end up around the world, the knowledge of language can be of use. Secondly, with the study of a foreign language, one also opens oneself up to other cultures. This allows in turn an appreciation for different points of view and belief systems. With an ever-shrinking world due to globalisation, the ability to empathise and understand the people from other countries is vital to reducing conflict and creating a more tolerant society. Finally, quite simply learning languages is excellent for the improvement of general cognitive skills.It seems to me that learning a foreign language, therefore, is more than just gaining the ability to speak a few words of a foreign tongue. It is part of intellectual and social development and needs to be continued for everyone in today’s schools.;Throughout the history of education, foreign language learning has been a consistent element. While some people believe that this is an unnecessary aspect of education, I disagree. Critics of foreign language learning might argue that most people rarely travel outside their own country and that the languages spoken in other countries are not widely shared. As a result, they claim that learning a foreign language is only useful for the brief period spent in a country where that language is spoken, and for some, it may never be used at all. They point out that the time, money, and resources spent on language instruction, materials, and travel seem like a wasteful allocation of resources, given the limited benefits.However, the advantages of learning a foreign language extend far beyond the occasional use on vacation or business trips. Firstly, acquiring one language provides insight into the workings of all languages, making it a valuable tool regardless of where one travels. Secondly, studying a foreign language exposes individuals to new cultures, fostering appreciation for diverse perspectives and belief systems. In an increasingly globalized world, the ability to understand and empathize with people from other countries is crucial for reducing conflict and promoting tolerance. Lastly, learning languages has been shown to improve general cognitive skills.In my opinion, learning a foreign language is not just about acquiring a few words of a foreign language, but rather it is an essential part of intellectual and social development. As such, it should continue to be a part of every student's education in today's schools. The benefits of foreign language learning far outweigh the costs, and its importance cannot be overstated in an interconnected world.
1073;Some people feel that the design of newly constructed buildings in big cities should be controlled by governments. Others believe those who finance the construction of a building should be free to design it as they see fit.Discuss both these views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is often argued that governments should involve in construction's design in huge cities, while others argued that governments do not have to retrict the free of designers' imagination if those designs are splendid fit on the cities. I believe that if that were to happen, it would be the positive development. This essay will highlight the both views and give personal opinion from the former argument's side.To begin with latter opinion, although governments have worried about the combination of buildings entirely, the strong limitation about design can cause squandering of designers' skills. There are huge number of competitions about designing building in this society, and the evolution in these fields has developed dramatically. However, if there is a strict criteria on design of building, the majority of intelligences do not need to hammer away to come up with revolutional outline for building.On the other hand, signitured design of the big cities by itself can be the purpose of trevelling as a landmark, and it can be followed by significant economical achievement in the country. To take myself as an example, in 2017, I went to Gold Coast for study automotive engineering, and I was stunnied becaused of the atmosphere which is formed by combination of similar buildings and beach. Furthermore, according to the research from Sydney university, Gold Coast is one of the cities which make a fortune because of marvelous view.To sum up with, I would therefore argue that in spite of the fact that building design restriction can influence on architects negatively, it has a potential ability to make a significant profit in the future.;The role of government in regulating building design in large cities is a topic of ongoing debate. Some argue that governments should exert control over design to ensure cohesion and harmony in urban landscapes, while others believe that such intervention would stifle the creativity and imagination of designers, potentially hindering innovation. I firmly believe that government involvement in design regulation could lead to positive outcomes. This essay aims to present both perspectives and argue in favor of government regulation, based on the potential benefits it could bring.On one hand, proponents of minimal government interference in design argue that strict regulations could lead to underutilization of designers' talents. The design and architecture fields are highly competitive, with numerous competitions driving innovation and significant advancements. However, rigid design criteria could deter talented individuals from striving for groundbreaking designs, as their creativity would be constrained by predetermined guidelines.On the other hand, distinctive and well-planned urban design can serve as a major tourist attraction and a symbol of a city's identity, potentially leading to substantial economic gains. For instance, during my visit to the Gold Coast in 2017 for automotive engineering studies, I was impressed by the aesthetic harmony created by the combination of architectural styles and natural beauty. Research from the University of Sydney highlights the Gold Coast as an example of a city that benefits financially from its visually appealing landscape.In conclusion, despite the potential negative impact of design restrictions on architects, I argue that such regulations possess the potential to yield significant economic benefits in the long run. By guiding urban design, governments can contribute to creating unique and appealing cityscapes that attract tourism and boost local economies, outweighing the potential drawbacks on designer creativity.
1292;Some people feel that with the rise of artificial intelligence, computers and robots will take over the roles of teachers. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;With ever increasing technological advances, computers and robots are replacing human roles in different areas of society. This trend can also be seen in education, where interactive programs can enhance the educational experience for children and young adults. Whether, however, this revolution can also take over the role of the teacher completely is debatable, and I oppose this idea as it is unlikely to serve students well.The roles of computers and robots can be seen in many areas of the workplace. Classic examples are car factories, where a lot of the repetitive precision jobs done on assembly lines have been performed by robots for many years, and medicine, where diagnosis, and treatment, including operations, have also been assisted by computers for a long time. According to the media, it won’t also be long until we have cars that are driven automatically.It has long been discussed whether robots and computers can do this in education. It is well known that the complexity of programs can now adapt to so many situations that something can already be set up that has the required knowledge of the teacher, along with the ability to predict and answer all questions that might be asked by students. In fact, due to the nature of computers, the knowledge levels can far exceed a teacher’s and have more breadth, as a computer can have equal knowledge in all the subjects that are taught in school, as opposed to a single teacher’s specialisation. It seems very likely, therefore, that computers and robots should be able to deliver the lessons that teachers can, including various ways of differentiating and presenting materials to suit varying abilities and ages of students.Where I am not convinced is in the pastoral role of teachers. Part of teaching is managing behaviour and showing empathy with students, so that they feel cared for and important. Even if a robot or computer can be programmed to imitate these actions, students will likely respond in a different way when they know an interaction is part of an algorithm rather than based on human emotion.Therefore, although I feel that computers should be able to perform a lot of the roles of teachers in the future, they should be used as educational tools to assist teachers and not to replace them. In this way, students would receive the benefits of both ways of instruction.;As technology continues to advance at an unprecedented rate, computers and robots are increasingly assuming roles traditionally held by humans in various sectors of society. This phenomenon is also observable in the education sector, where interactive programs have the potential to enhance the learning experience for children and young adults. However, the notion that this technological revolution could completely supplant the role of teachers is a topic of debate, and one that I disagree with, as I believe it would not serve the best interests of students.The integration of computers and robots into the workforce is a trend that has been evident for some time. Classic examples include automobile manufacturing, where robots have long been used to perform repetitive and precise tasks on assembly lines, and the medical field, where computers have been employed to assist with diagnoses, treatments, and even surgical operations. According to media reports, it is anticipated that we will soon have vehicles capable of driving themselves autonomously.The question of whether computers and robots can assume educational roles has been a subject of discussion for a considerable period. It is widely acknowledged that the complexity of computer programs has reached a level where they can be tailored to adapt to a multitude of situations, thereby potentially replicating the knowledge and predictive capabilities of a teacher, including the ability to answer questions posed by students. Furthermore, due to the inherent nature of computers, their knowledge base can far surpass that of a human teacher, both in depth and breadth, as they can possess equivalent knowledge across all subjects taught in schools, unlike human teachers who specialize in specific areas. It thus appears highly plausible that computers and robots could deliver lessons in a manner comparable to, if not surpassing, that of human teachers, including adapting instructional materials to cater to diverse student abilities and ages.My skepticism lies in the realm of the pastoral aspects of teaching. A significant component of a teacher's role involves managing student behavior and displaying empathy, thereby making students feel valued and cared for. Even if a robot or computer could be programmed to mimic these actions, students are likely to respond differently when they are aware that an interaction is predetermined by an algorithm rather than being a genuine expression of human emotion.In conclusion, while I believe that computers and robots will undoubtedly be capable of performing many of the functions of teachers in the future, I advocate for their use as supplementary educational tools to support teachers, rather than as replacements. This approach would enable students to benefit from both the technological and human aspects of instruction, thereby enriching their educational experience.
1285;Some people like to own the place where they live, but other people like to rent where they live. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The debate over whether it is better to own or rent the property in which one lives is one that has strong supporters on each side. There are persuasive arguments for both points of view.One of the main advantages of renting a property is flexibility. Usually, a tenant only has to give a month’s notice before changing where he or she lives. If a property is owned and a change is needed, the property must be put onto the market and it is frequently a long and stressful process to get a sale completed. Sometimes, the wrong time of year or a bad market can mean that a sale is not possible. Another advantage of renting is that a large amount of a family’s capital is not tied up in the property. Property can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and often a lot more. If one rents, this money can be spent on other things to help improve the family’s quality of life. If the property is on a mortgage, then the deposit, also often very large, is tied up in the property and the pressure of having to make substantial payments every month can cause a lot of stress.Owning a property does have various advantages, though. Even though people usually have to service a mortgage every month with payments, this money is then built up with the property. With renting, the money is lost to the landlord, but at the end of the term of the mortgage, the whole property is owned by the family. This makes the process of living in a property a type of investment. In addition, the property’s value often goes up after time, frequently creating a substantial profit. Owning the property where one lives can also create a sense of well-being and self-actualisation.The decision to whether one rents or owns the property in which one lives really boils down to individual preference. My opinion is that it is much more preferable to own a property, mainly because it creates a valuable asset for the family.;The age-old debate about whether it's better to own or rent a home has sparked intense discussion, with passionate advocates on both sides presenting compelling arguments. On the one hand, renting offers a significant advantage: flexibility. Typically, tenants are only required to provide a month's notice before relocating, allowing them to adapt quickly to changing circumstances. In contrast, selling a property can be a lengthy and stressful process, especially if the timing is unfavorable or the market is slow. Moreover, renting frees up a substantial amount of capital that would otherwise be tied up in a property, which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. This capital can then be utilized to enhance the family's overall quality of life. Additionally, the burden of a mortgage and the associated monthly payments can be a significant source of stress.On the other hand, owning a property has its own set of benefits. Although monthly mortgage payments can be a financial strain, the money invested in the property ultimately translates into ownership. In contrast to renting, where payments are essentially lost to the landlord, owning a property allows families to build equity over time. Once the mortgage is fully paid off, the property is entirely owned by the family, making the investment a valuable asset. Furthermore, property values often appreciate over time, resulting in a substantial profit. Homeownership can also foster a sense of security and self-fulfillment.Ultimately, the decision to rent or own a property depends on individual preferences and priorities. In my opinion, owning a property is the more desirable option, primarily because it allows families to accumulate a valuable asset. However, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons carefully and consider what works best for each unique situation.
1405;Some people prefer to spend their lives doing the same things and avoiding changes. Others, however think that change is always a good thing. Discuss both sides and give your own opinion.;Nowadays, people are arguing whether an ideal lifestyle should be a stable one or should it include a wide ranges of changes.In my opinion, whether changes are needed should be determined the of you are at.Apparently, are favorable the development of young people, in to their careers. Primarily, an abundant experience in varieties of jobs enables the young to master a broad range of techniques and skills, leading to significant edge over counterparts in the competition for employment. Meanwhile, trying various roles in life and work provides wide of lifestyles for the young in the future. Only after this comparison can they realize what the real goals of their .However, other than frequent changes, the elderly who have undergone all these challenges may pursue a steady lifestyle. For the elders, concentration on their favorite activities would give rise to a sense of enjoyment and security, which is helpful to physical and psychological health. Due to a stable life, the elderly are less exposed to stress, leading to a decrease in adrenal hormones and resulting in their well-.Furthermore, degeneration of mental and physical function would make the elderly unlikely to adapt to external changes, causing and , which are not contributing to their health.Above all, it is unlikely to describe the changes in life with a positive or negative term. Accommodation for personal needs and goals is more important than the changes themselves.;The ideal lifestyle has become a topic of debate, with some arguing that it should be stable and others believing it should encompass a wide range of changes. In my opinion, the need for change depends on the stage of life one is in. For young people, changes are beneficial for their development and careers. Having a diverse range of job experiences allows them to acquire a broad spectrum of techniques and skills, giving them a significant advantage over their peers in the job market. Additionally, exploring various roles in life and work exposes them to different lifestyles, enabling them to compare and discover their true goals. On the other hand, after having navigated through life's challenges, older adults may prefer a more stable lifestyle. For seniors, focusing on their favorite activities fosters a sense of enjoyment and security, which is beneficial for both physical and mental health. A stable life also reduces their exposure to stress, leading to lower levels of adrenal hormones and improved overall well-being. Furthermore, the natural decline in mental and physical function with age makes it difficult for the elderly to adapt to external changes, which can be detrimental to their health. Ultimately, it's challenging to categorize changes in life as inherently positive or negative. What matters most is adapting to personal needs and goals, rather than the changes themselves.
1423;Some people say education is the only critical factor to the development of a country. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;One the one hand good education is a highly recommended skill in the developed countries, on the other hand of many people in regions of poverty. But what makes education key factor for the development of a countryWe must acknowledge that education is something that we all need. The differences are just what we learn. Mostly the limited educational horizons of poor and less educated people have more to deal with their personal situation than with problems of bigger effects on a country. Attending school is sometimes too expensive and it does not feed a family.Nevertheless there must be a reason for education. For me it looks like some countries have realized that Education is the key for the globalization process. If we take India for example we can see that a change in the educational system had changed the economy of the country. country has changed from a poor region to a high potential for IT knowledge.In regard to this fact of education seriously and offer it to a wide range of people. Spending money education is the key tippy title=”for”]to[/tippy] a new future effects on the economy and social life. All in all I agree with the importance of education for the development of a country. Less knowledge leads to poverty and . Learning and Knowledge is Power and an investment in the near future and therefore it has to be an official task.;On one hand, good education is highly valued in developed countries, while on the other hand, it remains an unattainable luxury for many people living in poverty-stricken regions. However, what makes education a crucial factor in a country's development? We must recognize that education is a fundamental necessity for everyone, regardless of their background or socio-economic status. The only difference lies in what we learn. Often, the limited educational opportunities available to poor and less educated individuals are more closely tied to their personal circumstances than to broader issues affecting the country as a whole. In some cases, attending school is a luxury that is simply too expensive, and it does not provide a means of supporting a family.Nonetheless, there must be a compelling reason why education is essential. In my opinion, some countries have come to realize that education is the driving force behind the globalization process. For instance, India's overhaul of its educational system has led to a significant transformation of the country's economy, from a impoverished region to a hub with vast potential for IT expertise.In light of this, it is imperative that we take education seriously and make it accessible to a broad range of people. Investing in education is the key to unlocking a brighter future, with far-reaching effects on the economy and social life. In conclusion, I firmly believe in the importance of education for a country's development. A lack of knowledge inevitably leads to poverty, whereas learning and knowledge are powerful tools that can shape the future. Therefore, it is essential that education be recognized as a top priority and a critical investment in the years to come, making it an official task of utmost importance.
87;Some people say free time activities for children should be organized by parents. Others say that children should be free to choose what they do in their free time. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;Whether parents should fully intervene in their children's organization of their leisure time or let them decide it, remains a big discussion. In this essay I will contrast the two opinions and I will explain why I think a good balance is needed.One of the reasons supporting the first view is the idea of the undeveloped children's ability to organize. This is because, although some of them might seem very mature for their age, others might struggle understanding the importance of having a routine, besides playing video games. For instance, many parents orientate their children helping them to organize hobbies and teaching a very important skill, time managment.On the other hand, some people encourage children to decide themselves what to do as this stimulates creativity and personal growth. This view, therefore, opens a new world for the little ones who can decide whatever they like, having multiple options. For example, children in this situation quite often are supported when they want to play sports or participate in a painting class.In my opinion, parents should not only be envolved as much as they can in all aspects of their children's lives, but also they might encourage the little ones to have personal opinions and decision about their hobbies and leisure actitivities. This may be a good way to build trust and communication between parents and children. Moreover, children learn responsability while being guided by their parents.In conclusion, some parents help their children more in scheduling their free time, while others intervene less leaving them to create a routine freely. I believe, parents should always be involved in their children's lives and decisions, allowing children participation too, which brings multiple benefits to their relationship.;The debate about whether parents should fully control their children's leisure time or give them autonomy to make their own decisions remains a contentious issue. This essay will examine both perspectives and argue that a balanced approach is necessary.One argument in favor of parental intervention is that children may not have the necessary skills to organize their leisure time effectively. Although some children may appear mature for their age, others may struggle to understand the importance of establishing a routine beyond playing video games. Many parents take an active role in guiding their children to develop hobbies and teach essential time management skills.On the other hand, some argue that giving children the freedom to decide their own activities fosters creativity and personal growth. This approach opens up a world of possibilities, allowing children to explore multiple options and make choices about their interests. For example, children who are given autonomy may be more likely to participate in sports or enroll in a painting class.In my opinion, parents should strike a balance between being involved in their children's lives and giving them the freedom to make their own decisions about hobbies and leisure activities. By doing so, parents can build trust and communication with their children, while also teaching them responsibility. This approach allows children to develop their own interests and opinions, while still receiving guidance and support from their parents.In conclusion, while some parents take a more hands-on approach to scheduling their children's free time, others give them more independence. I believe that parents should be involved in their children's lives and decisions, while also allowing children to participate and make their own choices, which can have numerous benefits for their relationship and the child's development.
1330;Some people say that all popular TV entertainment programmes should aim to educate viewers about important social issues. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;It is often said that all influential TV entertainment programs should be geared towards raising people’s awareness about social issues that matter. While some TV programs could be suitable for this purpose, I disagree with the view that it should be mandatory for all of them, as the decision whether to do so must take into account the nature of the TV content and the channel’s audience.There is a large group of professionals who would benefit from deepening their understanding of what is happening in the world. Stock traders and bankers, for example, must always keep track of numerous business trends on a global scale, and they would appreciate this type of information on their favourite TV shows. Young people are another suitable audience due to the fact that they enjoy learning about popular topics from TV programmes. For instance, SDGs or the Sustainable Development Goals has now become an important topic to learn for children at school. Educational TV would provide a welcome alternative to textbooks, making learning more fun.Despite the potential advantages of incorporating educational content in TV programs, it is important to remember that the purpose of entertainment TV is for people to escape reality, to take a break from their hectic lives. Being reminded about some troubling social issues would not be appreciated by those who just want to unwind after a long day at work. Another consideration is how the content is perceived by the audience, because broadcasting serious topics as part of a comedy show might lead some viewers to believe they are of lesser significance. This would make TV shows of light-hearted nature a poor choice for inclusion of content on pressing social issues.In conclusion, entertainment TV programs can be an effective form of education for some people and a great tool to spread information. However, not all of them should be used for this purpose as there are various ways people appreciate them.;The notion that all influential TV entertainment programs should focus on raising awareness about pressing social issues is a common one. However, I disagree with making this a mandatory requirement for all TV programs, as the decision to do so should depend on the type of content and the target audience. Certain professionals, such as stock traders and bankers, would benefit from in-depth coverage of global trends and issues on their preferred TV shows, as it would help them stay informed about current events. Young people are another suitable audience, as they often enjoy learning about popular topics through TV programs. For instance, educational TV programs could make learning about important topics like the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) more engaging and fun, providing a welcome alternative to traditional textbooks.Nevertheless, it is essential to consider the primary purpose of entertainment TV, which is to provide an escape from reality and a break from the stresses of daily life. Viewers who seek to unwind after a long day may not appreciate being reminded of troubling social issues. Additionally, the audience's perception of the content is crucial, as incorporating serious topics into a comedy show might lead viewers to perceive them as less significant. This suggests that light-hearted TV shows may not be the most suitable platform for discussing pressing social issues.In conclusion, while entertainment TV programs can be an effective means of education and information dissemination for certain audiences, not all programs should be utilized for this purpose. The appreciation and purpose of TV programs vary among viewers, and it is essential to consider these differences when deciding whether to incorporate educational content into a TV show. By doing so, TV programs can effectively cater to diverse audience needs and preferences, providing both entertainment and education.
1353;Some people say that arts subjects are as essential as academic ones and should be part of school syllabus (agree/disagree);"Some people say that art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are an essential part of education, and every school should include them in its syllabus. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give your opinion and examples from your own experience.Art subjects such as music, drama and creative writing are fundamentals that enrich our lives. However, some parents say schools on teaching more academic subjects, such as mathematics, science, literature and history. In my opinion, both academic and arts subjects should be taught and I will expand on the pros and cons of including arts in the school program further on in this essay.On the one hand, academic subjects are often required when we get into higher . Academic subjects may be considered as in the academic world. Personally, I have never taken an entrance exam of art subjects for high school or university. In other words, schools measured my academic abilities using academic subjects, not art subjects. To suit the current educational system, many parents in my home country, Japan, send their children to cram schools to study academic subjects deeply.On the other hand, art subjects can strengthen the creativity and flexibility of individuals. Liberal arts, which include cultural understanding and knowledge, also include other arts subjects. In addition, we are living in the era of automation and artificial intelligence which are replacing human labor and office work more and more. In this regard, human creativity becomes more important. Therefore, art subjects are being more in demand to make a difference between individuals and computers.In conclusion, academic and arts subjects should blend in a school syllabus in a balanced way. Art subjects can also a better personality in individuals, so participation in these classes should be encouraged as well as academic achievements.The writer explored the reasons why including arts subjects in school syllabus is a good idea, while fluently expressing ideas and supporting them by examples. Correct paragraphing assists with orderly presentation of information, making this essay easy to follow; the range of vocabulary is quite wide. Accuracy of expression needs a bit more attention (see corrections underlined in blue), but overall, this essay could achieve IELTS Band 8.";The importance of art subjects, such as music, drama, and creative writing, in education has sparked a debate. While some argue that these subjects are essential and should be included in every school's curriculum, others believe that academic subjects like mathematics, science, literature, and history should take precedence. In my opinion, a balance between academic and art subjects is crucial, and I will discuss the pros and cons of incorporating art subjects into the school program.On the one hand, academic subjects are often a requirement for higher education and are considered fundamental in the academic world. From my personal experience, I have never been required to take an entrance exam for art subjects to attend high school or university. Instead, my academic abilities were assessed through academic subjects. To adapt to the current educational system, many parents in my home country, Japan, enroll their children in cram schools to focus on in-depth study of academic subjects.On the other hand, art subjects have the power to enhance an individual's creativity and flexibility. Liberal arts, which encompass cultural understanding and knowledge, also include other art subjects. Moreover, we are living in an era where automation and artificial intelligence are increasingly replacing human labor and office work. In this context, human creativity becomes a vital differentiator between individuals and computers. Consequently, the demand for art subjects is on the rise, as they enable individuals to stand out from the crowd.In conclusion, I firmly believe that academic and art subjects should be balanced within a school's curriculum. Art subjects not only foster a more well-rounded personality in individuals but also encourage participation and creativity, alongside academic achievements. By incorporating art subjects into the syllabus, schools can provide students with a more comprehensive education that prepares them for an ever-changing world.
779;Some people say that modern technology has made shopping today easier, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion;It is commonly argued that the fast pacing technology has helped people do shopping at the present time more easily. However, some people think online shopping is really difficult for them. This essay will consider both the advantages and disadvantages of the use of technology for shopping.One disadvantage of online shopping can be mentioned is that people cannot familiarize themselves with online applications for ordering essential goods and food. In fact, the elderly are not good at technology enough to go to virtual supermarkets. Besides, those who live in remote areas are not accessible easily to technology to buy online groceries.Despite its disadvantage, online shopping has brought about advantages for those who are technology natives. Firstly, it can be time-saving. In fact, shoppers can order any things they need with some clicks on the items, payment method, and time of delivery. Especially in a lingering Covid-19, when social distancing measures have been effective in some places in Viet Nam, according to a survey, the number of online shoppers has been increasing day by day, and thus many applications have been into existence, developed, and thrived.Another advantage of virtual shopping is that it can be life-saving to many people in a pandemic across nations. Going to supermarkets can be detrimental to buyers due to the spread of viruses and the higher risk of infection. For example, in order to buy bread for breakfast, people have to go out for it and thus may be exposed to infectious or incubated victims of Covid-19. Moreover, with preventive measures of Covid-19 containment, such as people not being allowed to go out for their essential goods, if they do not know how to make an online order, it is really difficult for them to survive during a pandemic.In conclusion, the use of technology for virtual shopping is beneficial to our time-saving and life-saving matters, though it is not familiar to some people. In my opinion, thanks to its advantages, I will continue to go shopping online, though the world has gone through the Covid-19 pandemic successfully.;The advent of rapid technological advancements has made shopping easier for many people in today's world. However, some individuals find online shopping to be a daunting task. This essay aims to explore both the benefits and drawbacks of utilizing technology for shopping purposes.One notable disadvantage of online shopping is the difficulty some people face in navigating online applications to purchase essential goods and groceries. Specifically, the elderly often struggle with technology, making it challenging for them to access virtual supermarkets. Additionally, those living in remote areas may not have easy access to technology, further hindering their ability to buy groceries online.Despite these drawbacks, online shopping offers numerous advantages, particularly for those who are tech-savvy. Firstly, it is a significant time-saver. Shoppers can effortlessly order items with just a few clicks, selecting their desired products, payment methods, and delivery times. This has been especially beneficial during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, where social distancing measures have been implemented in various parts of Vietnam. According to surveys, the number of online shoppers has been increasing daily, leading to the development and proliferation of numerous online shopping applications.Another significant advantage of virtual shopping is its potential to be life-saving during a pandemic. Physically visiting supermarkets can be hazardous due to the risk of viral transmission and infection. For instance, going out to purchase something as simple as bread for breakfast can expose individuals to infectious or incubated Covid-19 victims. Moreover, with Covid-19 containment measures in place, such as restrictions on leaving home to purchase essential goods, not knowing how to make an online order can make survival during a pandemic extremely challenging.In conclusion, the utilization of technology for virtual shopping is beneficial in terms of saving time and lives, despite being unfamiliar to some individuals. In my opinion, given its numerous advantages, I will continue to shop online, even after the world has successfully navigated the Covid-19 pandemic.

727;Some people say that the experiences a child has before starting school have the most influence on their future life. Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. Discuss both views and give your own opinion?;There are a lot of research about development in human life, Some people say that the experiences a child has before starting school have the most influence on their future life. Others say that experiences as a teenager, especially at school, are more influential. In the following paragraph, I will discuss both view and give my opinion.On the one hands, There has a research that bad experience in children before begining at school, especcially in family, will become unforgettable deep heart. For example, Children who live with strict parents and has aggressive punishment when children doing littie wrong things. In the future, Children will tend to aggressive and feeling they has not received a love from family. This research surely reasonnable because family is an important factor of social life.On the other hands, There have an opinion even if children was velvet glove when raised with family. However, Especially in adolescent, Friend and teacher can infleuence as same as family because teenagers spend more time at school that with family as a reason learning in classroom more than primary school and have a more group work with friend. Thus, If teenager prefer to close with a good student (not smoking or drinking alcohol / invite classroom friends travel education museum in weekends or holiday), Parents can make sure that your child will mature to standard adults.In conclusion, In my opinion, Children would be infleuenced by family before begining at school. After that, They will has a lot of complex relationship in school from friends and teachers that can infleuences children. So, Children should try to control yourself in moral to be a best quality adults.;There is a significant amount of research on human development, with some arguing that early childhood experiences, particularly those before starting school, have the greatest impact on an individual's future life. Others, however, believe that experiences during adolescence, especially at school, are more influential. In the following discussion, I will examine both perspectives and share my opinion.On one hand, research suggests that negative experiences in early childhood, especially within the family, can leave a lasting impact. For instance, children who grow up with strict parents and face aggressive punishment for minor transgressions may develop aggressive tendencies and feel unloved. This research is reasonable because family plays a crucial role in social life. The environment and interactions within the family can shape a child's emotional and psychological development, influencing their behavior and worldview.On the other hand, there is an opinion that even if children are raised with care and nurturing by their family, their experiences during adolescence can be equally influential. As teenagers spend more time at school than with their family, they are exposed to a broader range of interactions, including those with friends and teachers. The school environment, with its emphasis on learning and socialization, can significantly impact a teenager's development. If a teenager associates with positive influences, such as friends who value education and abstain from harmful behaviors like smoking or drinking, parents can be assured that their child is on a path to becoming a mature and responsible adult.In conclusion, in my opinion, early childhood experiences within the family lay the foundation for a child's development. However, as children grow into teenagers, their relationships with friends and teachers at school introduce a complex array of influences that can shape their personalities, behaviors, and future outcomes. Therefore, it is essential for children to develop self-control and moral integrity to navigate these influences effectively and become high-quality adults.
337;Some people think history has nothing or little to tell us, but others think that studying the past history can help us better understand the present. Discuss both views and give your opinion.;With the development of technology, an increasing number of people try to acquire the latest technology such as computer programming, rather than to study history. There is a debate whether studying histroy could give us more advantages to understand the present society. In my opinion, obtaining knowledge of past history would be definitely helpful for us to live well in society today. I hold this opinion for two reasons, which I will elaborate on in the following essay.To begin with, looking back on history would give us the opportunity to notice mistakes which human beings used to make in the past. Specifically, all kinds of people and countries around the world had made innumerable mistakes throughout history. Besides, some of these mistakes might result in a huge number of victims. Therefore, human beings must avoid these tragedic events happening again. Above all, only knowing history could lead to avoidance of the recurrences. To be more specific, World War must be one of the serious events in human being history, and understanding of this truth have a significant impact on how we should live not to cause war again in the present society. It is manifest that leaning history is meaningful in this regard.On the other hand, some arguments can be made that old stories have little something to do with our present lives. However, closer examination would reveal that all the relationships present today originally come from something in the past. Knowing history enables us to find the best way to a fruitful future. The compelling example of this is racial discrimination in the U.S. Understanding the U.S. history could give us the best manner not to deteriorate relationships in the U.S. I suppose that studying history would be helpful for all human beings from this aspect.Having considered all the arguments above, learning history would be a major contributor to a better understanding of the present because we can know how to avoid the same mistake people used to made and how we should behave for the better result through history.;As technology advances, more and more people are seeking to acquire the latest skills, such as computer programming, rather than studying history. This has sparked a debate about whether learning about the past provides advantages in understanding contemporary society. In my view, acquiring knowledge of historical events is undoubtedly beneficial for navigating today's society. I hold this opinion for two key reasons, which I will explore in this essay.Firstly, examining history offers us the chance to identify mistakes that humans have made in the past. Throughout history, individuals and countries worldwide have committed countless errors, some of which have resulted in a significant number of casualties. It is crucial for humans to avoid repeating these tragic events. The only way to do so is by understanding history. A prime example of this is World War, a pivotal event in human history, whose understanding has a profound impact on how we should conduct ourselves to prevent similar conflicts in the present. It is clear that learning from history is valuable in this context.On the other hand, some argue that historical events have little relevance to our current lives. However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that all present-day relationships originate from past events. Studying history enables us to discover the best path towards a prosperous future. The example of racial discrimination in the United States illustrates this point. Understanding U.S. history provides the best approach to preventing the deterioration of relationships in the country. I firmly believe that studying history is beneficial for all humans from this perspective.After considering the arguments presented, it is evident that learning about history significantly contributes to a better understanding of the present. By studying history, we can learn how to avoid repeating past mistakes and how to behave in ways that lead to better outcomes. Ultimately, history provides invaluable lessons that can guide us towards creating a more harmonious and progressive society.
411;Some people think students should study the science of food and how to prepare it. Others think that school time should be used in learning important subjects. Discuss both views and give your opinion?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;These days a portion of the society consider that students must learn the subject of cooking food and ways to make meals meanwhile, a group of people think that educational institutions shall be used to study more essential courses. I strongly agree that schools should be used for learning far important subjects rather than cooking classes. In this essay a im going to examin and discuss both phenomenon viewpoints and draw my personal opinion.In one hand, some people think that cooking and food subjects should be an important courses in schools,in addition, the steps of preparing meals and information about food may help students for a healthy lifestyle.On the other hand, a group of individuals consider that cooking is a hobby and cooking classes must be optional to the student and not requiered for all students, to illustrate even more, a bigger portion of students may not be interested in cooking as others,whereas, schools must be used for more serious purposes ,for example, studying more complicated courses will have a positive effect on the students academic outcomes ,meanwhile, adding courses such as cooking might effect the students time manegement and influence their ability to focus on the important things,for further explaination, if they have a test or different assignments deadlines they should be really focusing on that rather than attending cooking classes.In conclustion, and after analysis of both penomenon i presonally believe that cooking classes should not be considered as an essential course for students in educational institutions.;In recent years, there has been a debate about whether cooking and meal preparation should be a mandatory subject in schools. While some people believe that students should learn about cooking and food, others argue that educational institutions should focus on more essential courses. I strongly agree that schools should prioritize more important subjects over cooking classes. In this essay, I will examine and discuss both perspectives and provide my personal opinion.On one hand, some individuals believe that cooking and food education should be a vital part of school curricula. They argue that learning about meal preparation and nutrition can help students maintain a healthy lifestyle. On the other hand, a group of people consider cooking to be a hobby and think that cooking classes should be optional, not mandatory. They argue that not all students are interested in cooking, and that schools should focus on more serious pursuits. For instance, studying more complex subjects can have a positive impact on students' academic outcomes. In contrast, adding cooking classes to the curriculum might distract students from their core studies and affect their time management skills. To elaborate, when students have upcoming tests or assignment deadlines, they should focus on those tasks rather than attending cooking classes.In conclusion, after analyzing both perspectives, I personally believe that cooking classes should not be considered an essential course for students in educational institutions. 
59;Some people think that governments should ban dangerous sports, while others think people should have freedom to do any sports or activity. Discuss both views and give your own opinion;From the known history of the humanity, many sports or activities have been done to enjoy ourselfs, keeping in shape, or spent time. Grown up people should be free to do any kind of sports or activities by their will unless they are not hurting anyone else except theirselfs.Some people think when a citizen hurt his/herself, tax payers need to pay for the health care fees, and it should not be consern for the tax payers since they are paying only for fundamental situations. This point of view is not matching with the freedom. Yes, there might be a fee for tax payers, yet freedom should be above on all fees. While some people prefers less dangerous activities, others can be interested in more dangerous activities, as well.Governments can have some precautions to make citizens' life better. Yet, they should not involve such things like banning sports since it is the preference of the people which dealing with the dangerous sports. Some people could want to make more unique or exciting sports, and it is quite natural. Banning such kind of activities can be considered as limiting people's freedom.Since most of the people living together for a quite time in a society, people should pay respect on each others preferences, unless it is not interesting other people's personal area. As a calm and relax person, I am not intend to make dangerous sports or activities. However, I do not think that I have the right or power to say other people what should they do or not, and vice versa.;Throughout human history, various sports and activities have been pursued for enjoyment, physical fitness, and leisure. Adults should have the freedom to engage in any sport or activity they choose, as long as they are not harming others, only themselves.Some argue that when an individual injures themselves, taxpayers should not be responsible for covering their healthcare costs, reserving taxpayer funds for only the most essential situations. However, this perspective conflicts with the principle of freedom. While there may be a cost to taxpayers, freedom should take precedence over financial concerns. Different people have different preferences when it comes to activities, with some opting for safer pursuits and others seeking more dangerous and thrilling experiences.Governments can implement precautions to improve citizens' lives, but they should avoid banning sports and activities that people willingly participate in, as these are a matter of personal preference. Some individuals may want to create new, exciting, or unique sports, which is a natural aspect of human innovation. Prohibiting such activities would be an infringement on personal freedom.As members of a society that coexists for an extended period, people should respect each other's preferences, as long as they do not infringe on others' personal space. As someone who values calmness and relaxation, I do not feel inclined towards dangerous sports or activities. Nevertheless, I believe that I do not have the authority to dictate what others should or should not do, and vice versa. This mutual respect for individual choices is essential in a free and harmonious society.
1325;Some people think that hosting an international sporting event is beneficial for a country, while others disagree. Do the advantages of hosting a major sporting event outweigh its disadvantages?;International sporting events are well-known for attracting a high level of attention because they give many people something to look forward to. Understandably, there are advantages and disadvantages for the host country, and careful consideration is required to determine whether a nation will benefit or lose from hosting a major sports championship.Worryingly, the new infrastructure required for hosting a major sporting event often comes at the expense of local people. Their lives get disrupted by construction works and at times residents have even been evicted from their homes for stadiums to be built. Worse still, practice shows the expensive, gigantic buildings constructed for the sports event aren’t being used afterwards and fall into disrepair, leaving the country with high maintenance bills. The financial burden from hosting the Olympic Games, for example, is staggering and can run into tens of billions. Still, the question remains whether or not the pros outnumber the cons.It is hard to underestimate the amount of influence on the country’s global status and prestige that comes with becoming a home to an international sporting event. New trade opportunities appear on the horizon, as it happened for many countries that hosted the Olympic Games. There is also a welcome increase in tourism, which gives the local economy a boost, injecting billions of dollars into the national budget. Construction of new stadiums, hotels and infrastructure such as new roads and rail links creates new jobs, further improving the country’s economy. Less tangible but still important is the aspect of national pride and the feel-good factor associated with hosting an international sports event.All in all, it seems to me that an international sporting event can bring more good than harm to a country, especially if its potential dangers can be avoided or minimised. Hosting a World Championship is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a country and an immense source of pride for its citizens.;International sporting events are renowned for generating immense excitement and anticipation among people worldwide. However, hosting such events comes with both benefits and drawbacks, making it essential for countries to carefully weigh the pros and cons before deciding to host a major sports championship. A significant concern is that the new infrastructure required for hosting these events often comes at a substantial cost to local residents, whose lives are disrupted by construction and may even be forced to leave their homes to make way for stadium developments. Moreover, the expensive and massive structures built for these events frequently fall into disuse and disrepair after the event, leaving the host country with hefty maintenance bills. The financial burden of hosting events like the Olympic Games can be staggering, with costs running into tens of billions of dollars. Despite this, the question remains as to whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Hosting an international sporting event can have a profound impact on a country's global standing and prestige. It can unlock new trade opportunities, as has been the case for numerous countries that have hosted the Olympic Games. Additionally, there is a significant surge in tourism, which provides a substantial boost to the local economy, injecting billions of dollars into the national treasury. The construction of new stadiums, hotels, and infrastructure such as roads and rail links creates new employment opportunities, further enhancing the country's economy. The intangible aspects of national pride and the feel-good factor associated with hosting an international sports event should not be underestimated either.In conclusion, it appears that hosting an international sporting event can bring more benefits than drawbacks to a country, particularly if the potential risks can be mitigated or minimized. Hosting a World Championship is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a nation and an immense source of pride for its citizens.
575;Some people think that hosting international sports events may be beneficial for a country. Discuss both views.;Certain people believe that organizing international sports competitions could benefit host countries. While hosting sport events might also entail risks, I firmly believe that nations would gain much more than they would lose, as I will explain below.International sport competitions are usually large events that bring together thousands of people including athletes, staff, and tourists. This usually represents an attractive opportunity for local business and investors. People need to be fed, thus activating restaurants' economy. Additionally, they need a place to sleep and rest, which would benefit hotels. On the other hand, many countries hosting international competitions build new infrastructure, including stadiums, pools, public squares, and even airports. It is clear that several cities around the world have developed as a result of hosting such events. Let us take the example of the city Montreal in Canada, which hosted the olympic games a few decades ago. Organizing sports events also represents an opportunitty to improve the international image of a country. For example, it is not a secret that some countries such as Germany and Russia have used the World Cup to improve their international image, with positive results overall. Finally, since inhabitants of the host nation would feel inspired to practice a new sport, we could argue that competitions could additionally improve the health and wellbeing of citizens in the long term.It is important to mention, however, that hosting sport events might also entail some risks. These competitions are usually complex and expensive to organize, and middle- or low-income economies could better use their resources to build vital infrastructure, such as hospitals and schools. Moreover, examples around the world illustrate that some politicians see these events as an opportunity for curruption.In conclusion, there are more benefits than risks for countries when it comes to hosting international sport events. These events might translate into economic opportunities for local business and investors, could bring new infrastructure, and may trigger development.;Many individuals believe that hosting international sports competitions can have a positive impact on the host country. Although there are potential risks involved, I strongly believe that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, as I will outline below.International sports competitions typically attract thousands of people, including athletes, staff, and tourists, creating a lucrative opportunity for local businesses and investors. The influx of visitors boosts the demand for food and accommodation, stimulating the economy of restaurants and hotels. Furthermore, hosting international competitions often prompts countries to invest in new infrastructure, such as stadiums, swimming pools, public squares, and airports. This, in turn, can contribute to the development of cities worldwide. A notable example is Montreal, Canada, which hosted the Olympic Games several decades ago and has since experienced significant growth. Organizing sports events also provides a chance for countries to enhance their international reputation. For instance, countries like Germany and Russia have successfully leveraged the World Cup to improve their global image. Additionally, the inspiration to engage in new sports sparked by these events can lead to improved health and wellbeing among the host nation's citizens in the long run.However, it is essential to acknowledge that hosting sports events also carries some risks. The complexity and high costs associated with organizing these competitions can be a burden, particularly for middle- or low-income economies, which might be better off allocating their resources to essential infrastructure like hospitals and schools. Moreover, there are examples worldwide of politicians exploiting these events for corrupt purposes.In conclusion, the advantages of hosting international sports events outweigh the disadvantages. These events can generate economic opportunities for local businesses and investors, bring about new infrastructure, and stimulate development, ultimately benefiting the host country.
1017;Some people think that instead of preventing climate change, we need to find a way to live with it. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Whilie some people believe that we can live with climate change instead of dealing with that, I don't agree with this idea because climate change can bring various disadvantages for our life.There are many disadvantages of climate change which can gradually push animals and also human to extinction. First and foremost, climate change promote the process of global warming which is one of the most dangerous result of climate change. Because of this situation, ice in 2 polar areas is melting day by day. As a result, the level of sea water will go up. Therefore, countries which are near by the sea may be drown in the future. Another drawback of climate change is that it causes many disaster. The figure for disaster is predicted to increase because of climate change. Hence, people and animals will have to deal with many dangerous disaster which can bring a lot of damage.Beside, I believe there are also many way to prevent climate change. Firstly, from my perspective, education is the best way to deal with the changing of climate. Because education raises the awareness of people about how dangerous climate change is, and it also teach people to protect the environment. Therefore, the effect of climate change will decrease. Secondly, local community should hold more volunteer activity for people to clean the palace where they live, so people can make sense of environmental protection and their neighborhood will also be cleaned. This activity can also contribute to prevent climate changeIn conclusion, I believe that people can't live with climate change and people have to prevent it.;While some individuals think that we can coexist with climate change rather than addressing it, I disagree with this notion because climate change poses numerous threats to our existence. The disadvantages of climate change are multifaceted and can ultimately drive both animals and humans towards extinction. Primarily, climate change accelerates global warming, one of its most perilous consequences. As a result, the polar ice caps are melting at an alarming rate, causing sea levels to rise. Consequently, coastal countries are at risk of being inundated in the future. Another significant drawback of climate change is the increased frequency of natural disasters. The incidence of such catastrophes is predicted to rise due to climate change, forcing both humans and animals to confront dangerous situations that can inflict substantial damage.Moreover, I am convinced that there are several strategies to mitigate climate change. In my opinion, education is the most effective way to combat climate change. By raising awareness about the dangers of climate change and teaching environmental protection, education can decrease its impacts. Additionally, local communities should organize more volunteer activities aimed at cleaning public spaces, fostering a sense of environmental responsibility among residents and beautifying neighborhoods. Such initiatives can also contribute to preventing climate change.In conclusion, I firmly believe that humans cannot afford to coexist with climate change and must take proactive measures to prevent it. It is imperative that we acknowledge the severity of climate change and work collectively towards mitigating its effects to ensure a sustainable future for all.
1341;Some people think that it is fine for professional athletes to misbehave on or off the field, as long as they are playing well (opinion);"Some people think that it is fine for professional sportsmen and sportswomen to misbehave on or off the field, as long as they are playing well.Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Sample EssayAlthough most professional athletes are aware of their position as role models for their fans and behave accordingly, there are sportsmen and sportswomen who behave poorly during matches and in their private life. While some people find it acceptable as long as their performance on the field is not impacted, not everyone agrees with that point of view.Those who put athletes’ performance on the field above everything else point out that competitive environment and immense pressure the sports people are under affect their behavior. They argue that athletes are entitled to privacy and their actions before and after games should not concern the general public. I find this hard to agree with, because poor behavior in sports people is incompatible with their role in public’s life and also for the reason that their actions could negatively affect their entire sports industry.The main reason why I believe athletes should behave well at all times is that their behavior is tremendously influential. Spectators respect players and many copy their actions and behavior; therefore, if top players misbehave or violate laws, some of the fans may feel compelled to follow their example and behave badly. For example, after an acclaimed baseball player was caught using drugs some years ago, the number of people who were arrested for the same crime significantly increased. This shows quite clearly why high profile players should consider their actions very carefully in order to promote a peaceful society.In addition, the behavior of athletes might affect the popularity of their sports. Some companies sponsor successful athletes who boost their brand recognition and sales of their products. Players and sports industry executives are financially compensated for endorsing products and participating in commercial advertisements. If they demonstrate poor behavior, sponsors could direct their money elsewhere, and as a result sports matches could suffer due to lack of funds. To illustrate, Sumo, a traditional Japanese sport, is held every season thanks to resources donated by companies. In a year when a Sumo player was involved in a violent crime, no matches were held, resulting in a large deficit of funds.In conclusion, I completely disagree with the opinion that top athletes are permitted to behave badly because their behavior may negatively influence the public behavior and sports industry itself.Assessor’s comment: This response addresses both sides of the argument by exploring the reasons why some people think athletes are allowed to behave poorly as long as they play well, and the reasons why others think poor behavior has no excuse. This response deserves a high score for task achievement because of that. A good range of cohesive devices is used in this essay; that and the organisation of ideas makes it easy to follow. Sentence structures are varied and the vocabulary is quite rich, the author also showed good control of grammar and spelling. It is worth noting that this sample is longer than the recommended 260 – 285 words, however, this isn’t an issue provided the author can complete an essay of this length and quality in under 40 minutes. Overall this is a good example of a Band 8 essay.";The question of whether professional athletes should be allowed to misbehave on or off the field as long as they perform well is a topic of debate. While some people think that their performance is all that matters, others disagree. In this essay, I will argue that athletes should always behave well, both on and off the field.Most professional athletes are aware that they are role models for their fans and behave accordingly. However, some athletes behave poorly during matches and in their private lives. Those who prioritize athletes' performance argue that the competitive environment and immense pressure affect their behavior, and that they are entitled to privacy. I disagree with this view because athletes' behavior has a significant impact on their fans and the sports industry as a whole.The main reason why athletes should behave well is that their behavior is highly influential. Fans respect and imitate their actions, and poor behavior can lead to negative consequences. For example, after a famous baseball player was caught using drugs, the number of people arrested for the same crime increased significantly. This shows why high-profile players should consider their actions carefully to promote a peaceful society.Furthermore, athletes' behavior can affect the popularity of their sports. Companies sponsor successful athletes to boost their brand recognition and sales. If athletes demonstrate poor behavior, sponsors may withdraw their funding, leading to a lack of funds for sports matches. For instance, a traditional Japanese sport, Sumo, relies on company donations to hold matches. When a Sumo player was involved in a violent crime, no matches were held, resulting in a significant financial deficit.In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the opinion that athletes can behave poorly as long as they perform well. Their behavior can negatively influence public behavior and the sports industry itself. As role models, athletes have a responsibility to behave well and promote a positive image.
1422;Some people think that it is important to use leisure time for activities that develop the mind, such as reading and doing crossword puzzles. Others feel that it is important to give one’s mind a rest in leisure time. Discuss.;As we are human we naturally need to rest leisure time to stress of work and everyday life. In fact, every individual need to do what they want and . Personally, I prefer to be active during this time because . Moreover, people are free what they do their leisure time, and nobody can say what is the best.Some people want to relax after their day of work. These people may prefer to relax by watching movies, reading or getting a massage. People who have a such as doctors, teachers and builders may choose these types of activities. If you are a doctor, you may feel that you want to let your body rest after work and you don’t want to do a five kilometer run after work, because you are already physically tired.On the other hand, some people choose to be active in their leisure time because they do . For example, these people many spend all day sitting on a chair and their work. At the end of a working day, they a backache, and all of their body tired so they need to stretch their arms and improve their health by doing some activity such as going to the gym or swimming.To sum up, the important thing is that people want to stay healthy by choosing what is best for them. In my view, the wrong way is to stay at home in your leisure time if you have a job.;As humans, we naturally require rest and leisure time to alleviate the stress of work and everyday life. Every individual needs to do what they want and enjoy during this time. Personally, I prefer to stay active during my leisure time because it helps me unwind and recharge. Moreover, people are free to do what they want during their leisure time, and no one can dictate what is best.Some individuals want to relax after a long day of work, and they may prefer to unwind by watching movies, reading, or getting a massage. Professionals such as doctors, teachers, and builders may opt for these types of activities to calm their minds and bodies. For instance, if you're a doctor, you may feel the need to let your body rest after a physically demanding day, and a five-kilometer run might be the last thing on your mind.On the other hand, some people choose to be active during their leisure time because they spend most of their workday sitting on a chair. After a long day of sitting, they may experience backaches and fatigue, so they need to stretch their arms and improve their health by engaging in activities like going to the gym or swimming.In summary, the most important thing is that people should prioritize their health by choosing what works best for them. In my opinion, spending leisure time at home, especially if you have a job, is not the ideal way to spend your free time. Instead, people should aim to strike a balance between rest and activity to maintain their overall well-being.
1215;Some people think that it is important to use leisure time for activities that improve the mind, such as reading and doing word puzzles.Other people feel that it is important to rest the mind during leisure time.Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.Write at least 250 words.;Leisure period from our everyday busy schedules is absolutely a well cherished time by most people. What should exactly be done during this free time has been the subject of debate for a while. Some would argue that engaging in simple and less brain tasking activities during this time keeps the mind busy,facilitates mental alertness and sanity.While other scholars would argue that keeping the mind relaxed would improve focus and recharge the mind for when needed at work after the free period has waned off.On the one hand, it seems beneficial to engage in activities that keeps the mind slightly engaged during our leisure period. This is basically due to the fact that some mind consciousness might be lost when idle.Sluggishness may thereforeset in when required to partake in activities that requires full attention. Hence playing chess and games might help maintain ones' awareness during a less busy period. Secondly, getting involved in basic activities like reading and surfing the internet during these free period could also help improve ones intellectual capacity and also overall general knowledge that could well be very beneficial to improving the entire state of the mind.On the other hand, those who say its essential to rest the mind after extensive period of activities might have a point.This is because resting the mind will help recharge Ones' batteries and general condition of the mind. Take for instance, a Tech inclined engineer that uses his mind and brain a lot to profer solutions to complex problems. A liitle period to be calm and relaxed will be of utmost importance to alleviate a potential mind and thoughts exhaustion.In conclusion, while it seems very important and beneficial to rest the mind during leisure period to aid rebooting of the mind and brain.I strongly believe that getting involved is some innovative and creative activities during these period improves our general state of health and mind.;The leisure time we carve out from our hectic daily schedules is a treasured commodity for most individuals. However, the best way to utilize this free time has been a topic of discussion for some time. There are two prevailing viewpoints on this matter. On one hand, some argue that participating in simple, yet mildly engaging activities during leisure time helps maintain mental alertness and sanity by keeping the mind active. This perspective posits that such activities prevent the mind from becoming idle, which can lead to a state of sluggishness when one is required to focus intensely on tasks.Engaging in activities like playing strategic games such as chess, reading, or browsing the internet can be beneficial. These activities not only maintain awareness and mental sharpness during less busy periods but also contribute to the enhancement of intellectual capacity and the acquisition of general knowledge. This, in turn, can lead to an overall improvement in the state of the mind, equipping it better to handle the demands of work and other mentally taxing activities.On the other hand, proponents of mental rest argue that after prolonged periods of mental exertion, it is crucial to allow the mind to rest. This faction has a valid point, especially considering the importance of mental rejuvenation for individuals whose professions demand high levels of mental acuity, such as engineers or problem solvers. For such individuals, a period of calm and relaxation is not just beneficial but essential to prevent mental exhaustion and to recharge their mental batteries.In conclusion, while resting the mind during leisure periods is important for its rejuvenation, I firmly believe that engaging in innovative and creative activities during these times is more beneficial. Such activities not only help in maintaining mental health by preventing idleness but also contribute to personal growth and the enhancement of cognitive abilities. Ultimately, the key to making the most out of leisure time lies in striking a balance between rest and engaging activities that nourish both the mind and the spirit.
865;Some people think that it is more beneficial to take part in sports which are played in teams, like football, while other people think that taking part in individual sports, like tennis or swimming, is better. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;Sport play an essential role in shaping the personality of individual. Some people believe that sports which are played in teams are more beneficial like football, while others think that solo sports like tennis or swimming is better. The following essay will discuss both arguments and give my opinion that sports which are played in teams have more advantages over solo sport activites.First of all, there is no doubt that the individual sport activities enahnce people confidence. It helps building the personality and strentghen the mentality of the individuals. For examole, one role model in my home country was playing tennis table, he mentioned once in an interview, that sport helped him not only to win trophies but it raised his mental strength and shaped his pesonality.However, some people believe that, sports which are played in teamshave more advantages and all community will get the benefits. Soccer, for example, will help the players specifically the young children to understand working together and sharing the responsibility. In addition people will grow with better understanding to the concept of sharing achievements which can improve all the community. For instance, i was a member of soccer team in high school, me and my friends were taught, in order to win games we should put plans together and work as one unit. Furthermore, it helps me later in my career to understand the meaning of leadership and how the sharing responsibility and working together could bring the success to our endeavour.To conclude, solo sport can bring proud and honour to individuals butsports which played in teams teach people the meaning of working together which will improve the community in the future.;Sports play an essential role in shaping an individual's personality. While some people believe that team sports, such as football, are more beneficial, others argue that solo sports like tennis or swimming are better. This essay will discuss both arguments and present my opinion that team sports have more advantages than solo sports activities.Firstly, it is undeniable that individual sports activities enhance people's confidence, helping to build their personality and strengthen their mentality. For example, a role model in my home country, a talented table tennis player, once mentioned in an interview that sports not only helped him win trophies but also raised his mental strength and shaped his personality.However, many people believe that team sports have more advantages, benefiting not only the individual players but also the community as a whole. Team sports like soccer, for instance, teach young players the value of teamwork and shared responsibility. Moreover, they promote a deeper understanding of shared achievements, which can improve the community. Personally, I was a member of a soccer team in high school, and my friends and I were taught to work together as a unit to win games. This experience later helped me understand the importance of leadership and the value of shared responsibility in achieving success.In conclusion, while solo sports can bring pride and honor to individuals, team sports teach people the value of collaboration and teamwork, which can lead to a stronger, more harmonious community in the future.
765;Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children’s development than playing computer games. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Some individuals believe that playing outside has a more positive effect on children's development rather than playing computer games. I share the idea that being involved in outdoor activities is more beneficial than playing computer games.Active development is the main reason for including outdoor activities in children's life. All people know that the development of children is an extremely significant part of building a personality. To do so parents should try to involve their children in exploring local insects, animals or playing different games such as football, riding bicycles, and many other. This will only expand the knowledge of children, and consequently have a positive effect on their development. This is also important to have a healthy generation in the future. Parents can join their children or they can find some friends around and also be socially active. For example, a father can teach his son how to bicycle or how to take care of plants and trees.The next important reason for doing more outdoor activities for children is avoiding physical problems, which can cause computer games. Currently, a lot of people including children suffer from different side effects of a lazy lifestyle and obesity can exemplify it. To avoid problems with physical health in the future, spending a couple of hours should be recommended to all children.Of course, little time spent playing computer games will not hurt children, but it is important to limit it. To sum up, children should do more outdoor activities and play computer games less.;Many people believe that outdoor play has a more profound impact on children's development than playing computer games, and I couldn't agree more. Engaging in outdoor activities is far more beneficial for kids than spending time playing computer games.The primary reason for prioritizing outdoor activities is to foster active development in children. It's widely acknowledged that childhood development plays a crucial role in shaping a person's personality. To facilitate this, parents should encourage their children to explore the outdoors, whether it's observing local insects and animals, playing sports like football, or simply riding bicycles. This not only broadens their knowledge but also has a positive impact on their overall development, contributing to a healthier generation in the future. Moreover, outdoor activities provide an opportunity for social engagement, as parents can participate alongside their children or help them find friends to play with. For instance, a father can teach his son how to ride a bike or tend to plants and trees, promoting both physical activity and quality time together.Another significant reason to emphasize outdoor activities for children is to prevent physical health issues that can arise from excessive computer gaming. Currently, many individuals, including children, suffer from the adverse effects of a sedentary lifestyle, with obesity being a notable example. To mitigate future physical health problems, it's advisable for children to spend a few hours outdoors daily.While occasional computer game play is unlikely to harm children, it's essential to set limits. In conclusion, children should engage in more outdoor activities and reduce their computer gaming time. This balance is key to ensuring they reap the benefits of outdoor play while still being able to enjoy the occasional computer game.
613;Some people think that physical strength is important for success in sport, while other people think that mental strength is more important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;It is often argued out there about sports, debating about both physcial and mental strengths and which is far more crucial to the success. This essay will go over these two points of view in further depth and outline some expamples, where relevant, for each.On one side, some people think that the most important factor to succeeding in sports is the physical strength. Body strength is actually quite indispensable in any sport activity, especially those types of sports that demand a high fitness level and high physical endurance, etc, such as MMA fights, wrestling, football, and so on. All of these require an elevated and advanced charachterestics of one's body. For example, an athlete can not keep up a football match and running around for 90 minutes without a high body endurance, fitness, so on and so forth.On the other hand, the others believe that a powerful mentality and mindset are needed for such success and accomplishment. That is, they believe that one's attitude is the first key to success before anything else. People need to have some sort of a mindset with specific qualities, such as perseverance, determination, concentration, etc. and it's not always about havign a massive body strength. For example, some MMA athletes step in the ring with solid bodies, will not always win the games if they're not determined and persistent already, altought their opponents do not have that huge bodies. It's all about the mindset.In conclusion, it's not easy to decide which of these two criteria is more important than the other. However, I believe that any athlete must have these two, train them both before getting into any challenge, no matter what type of activity. An athlete must have a strong body and a trained attitude once and for all.;The debate about the relative importance of physical and mental strengths in achieving success in sports is ongoing. This essay aims to delve deeper into both perspectives, providing relevant examples to support each viewpoint.On one hand, some argue that physical strength is the most critical factor in succeeding in sports. Physical prowess is essential in many sports that require high levels of fitness and endurance, such as mixed martial arts, wrestling, and football. These activities demand a high level of physical conditioning, making body strength indispensable. For instance, a football player needs to possess a high level of endurance to maintain a 90-minute match, emphasizing the importance of physical strength in such sports.On the other hand, others believe that a strong mentality and mindset are paramount to achieving success. According to this perspective, a person's attitude is the primary key to success, preceding physical strength. Athletes need to cultivate a specific mindset characterized by qualities like perseverance, determination, and concentration. This viewpoint is illustrated by the example of MMA athletes who, despite having physically strong bodies, may not emerge victorious if they lack determination and persistence, even if their opponents are not as physically imposing. This underscores the significance of mental strength in sports.In conclusion, it is challenging to definitively say which of these two criteria is more important. However, it is evident that athletes need to possess both physical and mental strengths to succeed. Ultimately, I believe that any athlete must develop and train both aspects before embarking on any challenge, regardless of the type of activity. A strong body and a trained mindset are essential for achieving success in sports.
1349;Some people think that public health in a country can be improved by government making laws regarding nutritious food (agree/disagree).;Some people think that public health within a country can be improved by government making laws regarding nutritious food. Others, however, think that health is a matter of personal choice and responsibility. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Personal and public health are tightly related to food choices. While some people believe that the government should regulate nutrition to improve public wellness, others argue that it should be people’s decision whether to pursue a healthy diet or not. This essay will discuss both points of view and explain why the authorities should not control the types of food people can buy.Legislators could impose laws concerning nutritious food in an effort to have a healthier population, public health costs. Even if this could be considered a good idea, it would be very quite difficult to implement. To achieve this target, the rulers could impose a levy on unhealthy food options, or reduce their availability on the grocery stores shelves. In Italy, for example, products such as carbonated sugary drinks and chips are heavily taxed. As a result, the sales of these items have decreased. However, if the authorities start to take control of what their citizens can or cannot eat, it may be seen as limitation of freedom.Since personal freedom is an extremely important human right, many people think that they should be responsible for their choices regarding the food and drinks they decide to consume. I agree with this opinion because limiting nutritional options, even if it is done with the best outcome in mind, could consequently create dissatisfaction among the population, which would possibly lead to other public issues such as protests and demonstrations. A better approach could be educating the public about a healthy diet, which would help people make better-informed decisions about the food they consume. Many developed countries around the world employed this strategy and saw public health gains.In conclusion, even though the government is able to control the dietary habits of its population through taxation and restrictions, healthier citizens and reduced public health expenses isn’t the only possible outcome. Limiting personal freedom could result in social unrest and for that reason diet decisions are better to be left up to well-informed individuals.This response achieved the task requirements by discussing whether the government or individuals should be in control of their diet. The ideas are developed and supported by examples, the information is organised in paragraphs, and coherence is maintained throughout the essay. A range of sentences structures and advanced vocabulary is used in this work. Overall, it seems worthy of IELTS Band 8+.;The relationship between public health and food choices is a complex one, with some arguing that government intervention is necessary to promote nutritious eating habits, while others believe that individuals should be responsible for their own dietary decisions. This essay will delve into both perspectives and argue that the government should not regulate the types of food people can purchase.Proponents of government regulation argue that implementing laws regarding nutritious food can lead to a healthier population and reduced public health costs. To achieve this, governments could impose taxes on unhealthy food options or limit their availability in stores. For instance, Italy has implemented heavy taxes on products like sugary drinks and chips, resulting in decreased sales. However, such measures may be perceived as an infringement upon personal freedom, a fundamental human right.Many individuals believe that they should be accountable for their food and drink choices, and I concur with this viewpoint. Limiting nutritional options, even with the best intentions, may lead to widespread dissatisfaction among the population, potentially culminating in social unrest, protests, and demonstrations. A more effective approach would be to educate the public about healthy eating habits, enabling them to make informed decisions about their diet. Numerous developed countries have adopted this strategy, yielding notable improvements in public health.In conclusion, although governments have the capacity to influence dietary habits through taxation and restrictions, the outcome may not be solely healthier citizens and reduced public health expenses. Curtailing personal freedom could result in social unrest, making it more prudent to leave diet decisions to well-informed individuals. By adopting an educational approach, governments can empower citizens to make informed choices, ultimately leading to improved public health outcomes.This rewritten text maintains the original message and structure while refining the language, coherence, and sentence structure to enhance clarity and readability. The vocabulary and sentence structure have been improved to make the text more engaging and suitable for an IELTS Band 8+ score.
1386;Some people think that students who don’t take a break in studies between the high school and the university are at disadvantage compared to students who travel and work after high school before further continuing their education. Do you agree or disagree?;Nowadays, in our competitive world, to succeed, knowledge from school and university is not enough. Therefore, students who study from the school to university get fewer benefits and contribute less too, compared to those who travel or work and get experience and skills . There are two following reasons to support for my opinion. I refer to the group of people who study from school to university as ‘group A’ and the other group – as ‘group B’.Firstly, at school and university, what group A gains is almost entirely theory, theory and theory. Of course, theory is very , however, you can’t do everything with just theory. You must have experience. This is what group A . Although in the third or fourth year at university, group A can be apprentices in some companies, to help them approach their future jobs, they aren’t trained well because of the short time spent working. And the real job is still very strange to them. After graduating, without experience, group A students can’t accomplish their work perfectly. On the other hand, it takes them time and money to keep up with other experienced students and they may be scorned. Therefore, group A students can contribute less than group B who have the two most important things: skills and experience.Secondly, as group A students are contributing less, they surely get less benefit. Moreover, many companies which employ people in group A have to train them from ground-up. These companies take this cost from group A’s salary to reduce the risk of their employees leaving to other companies after being trained. So, less benefits are unavoidable and certain, group B members are more loyal and effective workers. They also have useful experience and skills. Besides, their education is the same as or even higher than that of group A. As the result, group B gets more benefits absolutely.In conclusion, I think a student should travel or work before going to the university. That way, not only will they have basic knowledge but also skills and experience which are useful for them to get a good job and have a brilliant future.;In today's competitive world, mere academic knowledge is insufficient to achieve success. Students who solely focus on their education from school to university, referred to as 'Group A', are at a disadvantage compared to those who gain practical experience through travel or work, referred to as 'Group B'. There are two key reasons that support this viewpoint.Firstly, the education system provides Group A with predominantly theoretical knowledge. Although theory is essential, it is not enough on its own. Practical experience is vital to complement theoretical foundations. While university students in Group A may have the opportunity to intern at companies, the brief duration of these internships often leaves them underprepared for the realities of their future careers. As a result, upon graduation, Group A students struggle to perform their jobs flawlessly, requiring additional time and financial investment to catch up with their more experienced peers, including those in Group B. This discrepancy in skill and experience means Group A contributes less to their professions compared to Group B.Secondly, the lesser contribution of Group A students inevitably leads to fewer benefits. Many employers have to provide extensive training to Group A members, which is often deducted from their salaries to mitigate the risk of employee turnover after training. This results in reduced benefits for Group A. In contrast, Group B members are not only more effective and loyal workers but also possess valuable experience and skills, coupled with an equivalent or even superior educational background to Group A. Consequently, Group B members receive more substantial benefits.In conclusion, I firmly believe that gaining practical experience through travel or work before attending university is beneficial. This approach equips individuals with not only foundational knowledge but also with the crucial skills and experience necessary for securing a desirable job and paving the way for a successful future.

However,rebuilding the personality of individuals and giving them the opportunity to make a positive impact in their community is a true reflection of genuine humanity. Therefore,I agree with the notion that wealthy individuals who have the ability to offer help to others should do so in order to create a healthy environment for everyone to thrive in our society. This essay will explain the reasons behind my opinion.Unfortunately, many people suffer from disadvantaged situations, such as job loss or financial difficulties, and as a result, they often lose the motivation to continue and support their families. Consequently, poverty persists in some societies and is often accompanied by limited access to education. To avoid falling into misery,some countries now support non-governmental organizations and institutions that provide assistance to poor communities, aiming to improve education and develop the health sector. For instance, organizations like the Red Cross and Save the Children offer help and support to rebuild individuals' personalities, which will undoubtedly enrich these communities with numerous benefits.Despite the positive picture mentioned above, some people believe that helping others alone is not enough. On the other hand, others think that no matter how challenging things may seem, if an individual has the courage to move forward, everything is possible. Nevertheless, people can find motivation even in the toughest times. For example, Helen Keller, an American author, was born with a disability but became one of the greatest authors in Western history.In summary, there is no doubt that people should have the courage to move forward, whether they receive help from others or not. However, people who can offer help will contribute to creating a peaceful and prosperous community for our future generations.
1081;Some people think that there should be strict laws to control the amount of noise a person makes because of the disturbance it causes to people.Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;With the increasing population in cities,noise pollution has been one of the important causes of concern.This essay presents the advantages and disadvantages of the strict laws that are made to control noise pollution.Noise pollution affects different groups of people in various ways.The increasing noise in recent days has led to increasing problems of hearing impairment in people in today's society.Also,the noise pollution has a devastating affects on the heart patients and it has been affecting people who are working and studying in various ways.By implementing strict rules like imposing heavy fines on vehicles honking unnecessarily and filing a case on the noise caused by the public gatherings like rallies,the above problems can be addressed.For example, recent studies have shown that the cities having less noise pollution have been leading better life when compared to those with noise pollution.However,implementing strict laws on noise caused by a person also has some disadvantages.Firstly,different religions have different kinds of festivals which cause a lot of noise.For instance,diwali,one of the most celebrated festivals in India,is celebrated by firing crackers causing a lot of noise is affected by implementing these laws.Secondly,most of the people with religious beliefs will have a bad impact by these rules.To give an example,the prayers in masjids are made with loud noise so that it can reach a large group of people living in the area.To conclude,implemeting strict rules like fines and filing a case on the people causing noise pollution have a good impact on the health of the society and increasing the efficiency of work where as the festivals and the religious centres have a negative impact by these laws.;The growing population in urban areas has led to a significant increase in noise pollution, making it a pressing concern. This essay explores the benefits and drawbacks of stringent laws aimed at controlling noise pollution. Noise pollution affects various groups of people in different ways, causing a range of problems. The rising noise levels have resulted in a surge in hearing impairment issues among the population. Furthermore, noise pollution has severe consequences for heart patients and disrupts the daily lives of working and studying individuals. Implementing strict regulations, such as imposing heavy fines on unnecessary vehicle honking and taking legal action against noise caused by public gatherings like rallies, can help mitigate these problems. Studies have shown that cities with lower noise pollution levels tend to have a better quality of life compared to those with high noise pollution. However, enforcing strict laws on noise pollution also has its downsides. For instance, different religions celebrate various festivals that generate significant noise, such as the Indian festival of Diwali, which involves firing crackers. Implementing these laws would negatively impact such celebrations.Additionally, people with strong religious beliefs may be adversely affected by these regulations. For example, prayers in mosques are often conducted loudly to reach a larger audience, and strict noise laws could hinder this practice. In conclusion, implementing strict rules, such as fines and legal action against noise pollution, can have a positive impact on public health and work efficiency. Nevertheless, these laws may have a negative impact on festivals and religious centers, highlighting the need for a balanced approach to addressing noise pollution.
1431;Some people think that they can learn better by themselves than with a teacher. Others think that it is always better to have a teacher. Which do you prefer? Use specific reasons to develop your essay.;It is certainly said that learning is an ongoing process .Every person something new their age, experience, knowledge and education. According to my point of view it is always better to have teacher or guide for study.One teacher has adequate knowledge to teach their student. knows ways to make subject easier for the students, moreover, he teaches them in an effective manner. For example, some students are weak in some subjects but a teacher them according to their mental capacity. . Some people can learn better in the topics with others.

They employ effective teaching methods, allowing students to grasp concepts more easily. For instance, some students may struggle with certain subjects, but a teacher can adapt their instruction to suit the student's mental capacity. Additionally, learning in a group setting, such as a classroom, provides students with the opportunity to engage with their peers and gain insights from others' perspectives. In today's fast-paced and competitive world, many people lead busy lives, and some may believe that they can learn more efficiently by attending classes online from the comfort of their own homes. With the internet at their disposal, they can access relevant information and learn at their own pace. Moreover, there is no specific time or age limit to acquiring new knowledge, and some things can only be learned through experience, such as developing new habits or discovering new facts.

Students can learn more easily with the guidance of a teacher than they would on their own, making the learning process more efficient and enjoyable.
693;Some people think the money spent in developing the technology for space exploration is not justified. There are more beneficial ways to spend this money. To what extend do you agree or disagree?;Space, so unknown for the humankind that it generates so much curiosity among experts and enterprenues. Due to this curiosity, the amount of resources and money invested in its exploration is surprisingly big. Developing technology for it is expensive but, in my humble opinion, completly justified.Firstly, developing technology is vital so that space exploration can be carried out succesfully. Experts have discovered that we only know a 4 percent of the entire universe. If with only that 4 percent we have accomplished amazing achievements, imagine what the human race could do when knowing a 10 percent.Secondly, space exploration and the technology involve on it not only will help the human race understand the universe but also will provide a whole new kind of tourism, space tourism. The CEOs of some of the most profitable business in America are investigating this possibility. The leading enterprises in this sector are Blue Origin from Jeff Bezos and Space X from Elon Musk. When discovered the way of sending people to space safely, space tourism will generate twice the money spent on technology for space exploration.In a nutshell, space exploration is crutial for the development of the human race. Furthermore, if this was not enough, all the technology developed will serve the purpose of creating a whole new kind of tourism that will generate billions of dollars in revenue. From my point of view, even though here on earth there are several problems to be solve with money, our future lies on space, so be must spend as much money as possible.;The vast expanse of space has long been a source of fascination for humanity, sparking immense curiosity among experts and entrepreneurs alike. As a result, the investment of resources and funding in space exploration is substantial. Although developing technology for space exploration is costly, I firmly believe it is a justified expenditure.First and foremost, advancing technology is essential for the successful exploration of space. Currently, we have only uncovered a mere 4% of the universe, and yet, with this limited knowledge, we have achieved remarkable feats. It is thrilling to consider the potential accomplishments of humanity if we were to expand our understanding to 10% or more.Furthermore, space exploration and the associated technological advancements will not only deepen our understanding of the universe but also pave the way for a novel form of tourism: space tourism. Prominent CEOs of lucrative businesses in America are already exploring this prospect. Companies like Blue Origin, founded by Jeff Bezos, and Space X, founded by Elon Musk, are at the forefront of this sector. Once the safe transportation of individuals to space is achieved, space tourism is poised to generate revenue exceeding twice the initial investment in space exploration technology.In essence, space exploration is paramount for the progression of humanity. Moreover, the technological innovations that emerge from this pursuit will also give rise to a new tourism industry, yielding billions of dollars in revenue. From my perspective, despite the numerous problems on Earth that require financial attention, our future is inextricably linked to space, and therefore, we must allocate as much funding as possible to ensure a prosperous and exciting tomorrow.
1309;Some people today believe that it is acceptable to use physical force to discipline children, but others feel it is completely unacceptable.Discuss this view and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Punishing children with physical force, or corporal punishment as it is also called, is something that was accepted not so long ago and people over the age of forty may well remember it. Nowadays, however, corporal punishment is against the law in most countries and adults who practise it can be taken to court. Children are always a vulnerable group and they depend on adults for protection and education. Of course, part of the growing up process is testing and breaking boundaries and it is nearly always necessary to instill discipline on a child. Whether or not it is necessary to use physical force to do so can be a very emotive subject.Supporters of corporal punishment often defend their standpoint by explaining that the corporal punishment is not, or should not be, excessive. They do not argue that a child should be beaten severely until he or she is bruised or cut. They argue that just the infliction of mild pain causes effective discipline and also the fear that it might be applied. People who grew up experiencing it might offer this point of view.Those who oppose using physical force on a child would say that the vulnerability and innocence of a child means that force should never be used. Children need to trust adults and believe that no harm will come to them. Additionally, children learn from adults and it is argued that corporal punishment will only teach children that force is an answer to various problems. It is also claimed that corporal punishment has no added benefits over other forms of discipline that do not require physical force. Using it can cause psychological harm to children and should be classed as child abuse.Personally, I do not believe that limited use of forms of corporal punishment can cause harm, and a parent who administers a mild form of it to his or her child should not be subject to criminal proceedings. Nevertheless, I would not use it myself. I can also recognise the possibilities of adults who are not a child’s parents misusing corporal punishment. Therefore, I believe that on balance physical force to discipline children should not be permitted.;The use of physical force, or corporal punishment, as a means of disciplining children was once widely accepted and is likely remembered by those over the age of forty. However, in recent years, the tide has shifted, and corporal punishment is now outlawed in most countries, with adults who practice it facing potential legal consequences. Children, being a vulnerable group, rely on adults for protection, education, and guidance. A crucial part of their development involves testing boundaries, necessitating the instillation of discipline. The question of whether physical force is necessary to achieve this discipline is highly debated and emotive.Proponents of corporal punishment argue that it is not about inflicting severe harm, such as bruising or cutting, but rather about using mild pain as an effective disciplinary tool, coupled with the fear of its potential application. This perspective is often shared by individuals who experienced corporal punishment during their own upbringing.On the other hand, opponents of physical force argue that children's vulnerability and innocence dictate that force should never be used. They contend that children need to trust adults implicitly, believing they will come to no harm. Furthermore, they argue that corporal punishment teaches children that force is a viable solution to problems, undermining the lessons of non-violent conflict resolution. It is also posited that corporal punishment offers no unique benefits over non-physical forms of discipline and can lead to psychological harm, qualifying it as a form of child abuse.From a personal standpoint, while I do not believe that limited, controlled use of corporal punishment inherently causes harm, and thus should not automatically lead to criminal proceedings against a parent, I would not personally employ it. I also acknowledge the potential for misuse by non-parental figures. Ultimately, weighing the considerations, I conclude that physical force should not be permitted as a means of disciplining children, prioritizing their well-being and the promotion of non-violent disciplinary methods.
1358;Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems, is this a positive or negative development?;Some people use the Internet to search for solutions to their medical problems. Is it a positive or negative development? Give your own opinion and examples from your experience.At present, the Internet plays a vital role in almost every aspect of human life. As a result, individuals are searching online reasonable solutions to their illnesses. Not everyone is convinced that access to such information online is safe and helpful. However, in my view, providing the general public with access to trustworthy information about medical disorders would invariably improve the quality of the medical care for the whole society.Nowadays, even though there are plenty of online platforms developed for medical education, most of the sites have not been written by professional healthcare providers. Hence, there is a high possibility of spreading wrong medical information throughout the world, unless the site developers are held accountable for the content they provide. If patients receive incorrect information about a medical procedure and follow the wrong advice, for instance, to remove a wart at home, it might lead to a serious infection, excessive bleeding or another medical emergency. That would constitute a negative effect of using online knowledge for medical treatments at home rather than visiting a professional.On the flip side, the Internet, the society is well aware of most common medical disorders and preventive measures. Consequently, a reasonable and prudent individual can decide whether to get professional opinion on one’s disease or to handle it at home, that they get reliable online medical information. Moreover, if patients can manage mild medical problems themselves, it would certainly reduce the workload at the local hospitals, freeing more doctors for patients in real need. Besides, if patients come with a certain extent of knowledge about their condition to the medical consultation, it would invariably be helpful to the medical practitioner for effective decision making.To sum up, it is evident that online search for information on medical disorders can be a positive development as long as the general public receives trustworthy information.This response addresses the topic well. The writer’s position is clearly explained and supported, the information is organised in paragraphs in an easy to follow way, and use of linking words is appropriate. A range of complex sentence forms is used and there are very few errors in word choice or word formation (underlined in blue). Overall, this essay is likely to score Band 8 in IELTS.;The use of the internet to search for medical solutions has sparked debate about its merits. In my opinion, providing the public with access to reliable online information about medical conditions can significantly enhance the quality of medical care for the entire society. Currently, the internet plays a crucial role in nearly every aspect of life, and individuals are leveraging it to find solutions to their health issues. However, not everyone is convinced about the safety and usefulness of online medical information.One of the primary concerns is that most online medical platforms have not been created by professional healthcare providers, leading to a high risk of disseminating incorrect medical information. If patients follow flawed advice, such as attempting to remove a wart at home, it could result in severe infections, excessive bleeding, or other medical emergencies. This underscores a negative aspect of relying on online knowledge for medical treatments instead of consulting a professional.On the other hand, the internet has raised awareness about common medical conditions and preventive measures. As a result, informed individuals can decide whether to seek professional advice or manage mild issues at home, provided they have access to trustworthy online medical information. Furthermore, if patients can handle minor medical problems independently, it would alleviate the workload at local hospitals, allowing more doctors to focus on patients in dire need. Additionally, when patients arrive at medical consultations with some knowledge about their condition, it can facilitate more effective decision-making by medical practitioners.In conclusion, it is clear that searching for medical information online can be a positive development, as long as the public has access to trustworthy information. This not only empowers patients but also complements the work of medical professionals, leading to better health outcomes. With the proliferation of online medical resources, it is essential to ensure the credibility and reliability of the information provided, mitigating the risks associated with misinformation and harnessing the full potential of the internet to improve healthcare.
949;Some say that because many people are living much longer, the age at which people retire from work should be raised considerably.To what extent do you agree or disagree?;People nowadays are living much longer.With the discovering of new medicine and with the innovation in the medical field, the life expectancy of a person skyrocketed over the last decade.Some people might think that the consequence of this phenomenon should be the fact that the age at which people retire from work ought to be raised considerably.I don't agree with this idea.Rather than involving the life expectancy of a person, we should consider the job itself.Is it tiring? Does it require a person to be able to react immediately to a potential problem?If the job is tiring I think that it would be better for a person to retire. If you end up being worn out every day because your job is very exhausting the life expectancy should not be the fact that decides if you have or not the right to retire.The question ought to be: Is the person physically and mentally able to cope with the work?The older you get the slower you become. This is another pivotal factor that should be taken into account when deciding the retirement age of a person.The ability to react to dangerous events keeps the working environment under control.Let's imagine a carpenter working on the construction of a new building.What if a wall suddenly falls? Does an elderly person react faster than a younger worker?I am an optimistic person but I would stick to my guns in this scenario betting on the younger person.I would like to wrap up this essay by saying that I could have thought of many more reasons that explain why the age at which people retire from work should not be based entirely on the fact that people are living longer.Of course, this can not be ignored but basing this decision only on this fact it is seen by me as a poor approach.;In recent years, people have experienced a significant increase in life expectancy, thanks to advancements in medicine and medical innovation. As a result, some argue that the retirement age should be raised substantially. However, I disagree with this notion. Instead of solely focusing on life expectancy, I believe we should consider the nature of the job itself. Is it physically demanding? Does it require quick reflexes and rapid problem-solving skills? If a job is exhausting, I think it's reasonable for a person to retire, regardless of their life expectancy. The deciding factor should be whether the individual is physically and mentally capable of handling the demands of their job.As people age, their reaction time and physical abilities naturally decline. This is a crucial aspect to consider when determining retirement age. The ability to respond swiftly to potential hazards is essential for maintaining a safe working environment. For instance, imagine a carpenter working on a construction site. If a wall were to suddenly collapse, it's unlikely that an older person could react as quickly as a younger worker. While I'm generally optimistic, I would bet on the younger person's ability to respond faster in such a scenario.In conclusion, I could have cited numerous additional reasons why retirement age should not be based solely on increased life expectancy. Although this factor cannot be ignored, relying solely on it to determine retirement age seems like a flawed approach to me. A more nuanced consideration of the job's demands and the individual's capabilities is necessary to make informed decisions about retirement age.
1389;Some say that the Internet is making the world smaller by bringing people together. To what extent do to you agree that the Internet is making it easier for people to communicate with one another?;"A global village, that is certainly what the world feels like nowadays. With the help of the , you can reach out and get to know people you might never have met in person. Articles can be co-authored, business deals can be finalized, degrees can be earned and at times even medical advice can be given- and all of this is just a click away.Electronic mail, instant messages, web cameras and microphones; all these gadgets and programs make the presence of the other person more real. Who knows; with the help of visual reality you might even get a 3-D image of the speaker! I believe that the Internet is one the best inventions of the last century, you can hardly get to miss anyone and nobody is really out of reach. You can keep in touch with your friends, and be able to do your work from your bedroom in your pajamas!However, the internet can also be a major source of harassment. Spammers and hackers can invade your privacy and get personal/confidential information, which otherwise they never get access to. You are never out of anybody’s reach, unless you make a conscious decision of not checking your email, there can be always more work waiting for you in your inbox and you might never have a moment to yourself. Worse yet, if you were a workaholic, you might never experience that stress-free vacation ever again in your life – simply, because you have your mobile workplace with you at all times.As a romantic, I will always look forward to getting an occasional letter in the snail mail. A personal letter, where I can sense the mood of the writer by the slants in his/her handwriting and get to know him/her better. But as a type A personality person, the internet gives me all what I dream of in terms of communication – the speed, reliability, and convenience of time and place. I can certainly tolerate its shortcomings any day, as long as it keeps me close to my loved ones.";The world has indeed become a global village, where geographical boundaries no longer limit our interactions. Thanks to the internet, we can connect with people we might have never met in person, collaborate on articles, finalize business deals, earn degrees, and even receive medical advice - all just a click away. Technology such as email, instant messaging, webcams, and microphones makes remote interactions feel more personal and immersive. With the advancement of virtual reality, we may even soon be able to see 3D images of the people we're communicating with. In my opinion, the internet is one of the most significant inventions of the last century, allowing us to stay in touch with friends and family, and work from the comfort of our own homes. However, the internet also has a darker side. It can be a breeding ground for harassment, with spammers and hackers threatening our privacy and seeking to exploit our personal information. The constant availability of work emails can also be a curse, making it difficult to fully disconnect and enjoy stress-free downtime. For workaholics, the internet can be a constant source of stress, making it impossible to truly disconnect from work responsibilities, even on vacation.As someone who appreciates sentimental gestures, I still cherish receiving handwritten letters in the mail. There's something special about being able to sense the writer's mood through their handwriting and feeling more connected to them. On the other hand, as someone who values efficiency and convenience, the internet provides me with the perfect means of communication - fast, reliable, and accessible from anywhere. While it's not perfect, I'm willing to overlook its shortcomings in favor of the connections and opportunities it provides, especially when it comes to staying close to loved ones.
655;Some systems require students to specialize in a limited range of subjects from the age of fifteen. Other systems require students to study a wide range of subjects until they leave school. What are the benefits of these two education systems and which is better?;"Education programs are different from one area to another area, there are systems that learners are required to choose restricted number of courses for their academic curriculum by the age of 15.while,other educational systems ask students to take comprehensive courses until they graduate from school. There are many positives for both trends, in my opinion limited range of academic subjects education system is better.On the one hand, it is basic knowledge to accept the idea that pupils who study selected number of subjects from age of fifteen are more informative academically in specified field of study. For example, when student decide to take medical subjects from early age the student will be prepared by tutors completely for the nominated curriculum,as a result all the student's focus will be on medical topics thus, the student is more qualified to practice medicine more efficiently after school graduation.Furthermore, this system will build a solid knowledge background in limited range of subjects can help to develop creativity at early age.Moreover, in the financial view point it may be better for students to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15; selected number of academic subjects means less money allocated for educational services by guardians.On the other hand, it is true to claim that general subjects system can prepare students to be more informative in various different live aspects. Since, students who register with wide range subjects system can gain academic knowledge and support in fields such as mathematics,physics,medicine,and....ect. Therefore,those students can select more than one speciality to practice as a professionalism in future.Besides, wide range system help to improve social interactions better,because friends will not be separated and they continue school education together until graduation,inaddition there is chance to make more friends as primises are more crowded.To sum up, educational systems main target is to develop and progress academic background of students.But, in my opinion,it is better to enroll limited range of subjects from age of 15 due to reasons like: solid academic background in specific field,creativity,and less financial burden on parents.";Education systems vary significantly from one region to another. In some areas, students are required to choose a limited number of courses for their academic curriculum by the age of 15, while in other systems, students are expected to take comprehensive courses until they graduate. Both approaches have their advantages, but in my opinion, the limited range of academic subjects system is more effective.On the one hand, it is widely acknowledged that students who specialize in a specific field of study from the age of 15 tend to be more academically informed in that area. For instance, a student who decides to pursue medical subjects from an early age will receive thorough preparation from tutors, allowing them to focus exclusively on medical topics. As a result, they will be better equipped to practice medicine efficiently after graduating. Additionally, this system enables students to develop a solid foundation in a limited range of subjects, which can foster creativity at an early age. From a financial perspective, enrolling in a limited number of subjects from age 15 can also be more cost-effective for students, as it requires less financial investment from parents.On the other hand, it is true that a general subjects system can provide students with a broader range of knowledge and prepare them for various aspects of life. Students who enroll in a wide range of subjects can gain academic knowledge and support in fields such as mathematics, physics, medicine, and more. This, in turn, allows them to pursue multiple specialties and become proficient in different areas. Furthermore, a wide range system can enhance social interactions, as friends can remain together throughout their school education and have opportunities to make new friends in larger, more diverse classrooms.In conclusion, the primary goal of education systems is to develop and advance students' academic backgrounds. However, in my opinion, enrolling in a limited range of subjects from age 15 is preferable due to the benefits of a solid academic foundation in a specific field, enhanced creativity, and reduced financial burden on parents.
1347;Some think that children should leave their family home as soon as possible while others believe they should stay for as long as they like (discuss);Some people think that it is best to encourage children to leave their family home as soon as possible. Others believe children should stay at the family home for as long as they like. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.Sample EssayAlthough it is thought by some that urging young people to abandon their family home at an early age is beneficial for them, others believe that it is better if children stay with their families for longer. In my opinion, leaving family home early has many advantages for children.On the one people think that youngsters ought to leave their parents’ house so as to learn life skills at an early age. Their reasoning is that it should push young people towards independence and make them learn from life lessons rather than merely rely on their parents. For example, students who pursue tertiary study away from their home city might learn taking personal responsibility. Also, living independently will teach children a lot by presenting some difficulties, which, consequently, will add some more experience that may prove essential in their future lives.On the other hand, it is argued that children should stay with their parents for longer for several reasons. Firstly, young people need advice from adults, and no one would be better suited to that than their parents. Secondly, life can be generally harsh, for children in particular. In other words, they might or take unnecessary risks if they mix with the wrong crowd. It is commonly known that young people tend to be by unethical people. To avoid that, being under parental supervision is utterly important for children.To sum up, while people’s opinions may vary, I believe that young people should leave their family home at an early age, while parents ought to provide them with appropriate advice and keep an eye on their well-being.This essay covers the task by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of leaving the family home early in life, and the writer’s opinion has been clearly stated. The arguments for and against have been organised in paragraphs and supported by examples. Accuracy of expression needs some work (see suggested corrections underlined in blue) and in one case sentence structure needs more attention. Overall, assuming the errors were corrected, this essay could score Band 8 in IELTS.;The debate surrounding the ideal time for children to leave their family home has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that it is beneficial for children to leave home as soon as possible, others contend that they should stay with their families for as long as they wish. This essay will delve into both perspectives and provide an opinion on the matter.On one hand, there is the belief that young individuals should leave their parental home early to acquire life skills. Proponents of this view reason that doing so will foster independence and prompt youngsters to learn valuable lessons through experience rather than mere reliance on their parents. For instance, students pursuing higher education away from their hometown are likely to learn personal responsibility. Moreover, living independently presents challenges that contribute to invaluable experiences, which are crucial for their future.On the other hand, the argument is made that children should remain with their parents for an extended period. The rationale behind this stance includes the need for guidance from adults, with parents being the most suited to offer such advice. Furthermore, life can be unforgiving, especially for youngsters, who may engage in unnecessary risks or fall in with the wrong crowd. It is well-documented that young people are susceptible to negative influences. Therefore, parental supervision is vital for protecting them from such adversities.In conclusion, although opinions on this matter vary, the belief is held that youngsters should leave their family home at a relatively early age. However, it is equally important for parents to provide them with sage advice and maintain a watchful eye over their well-being. This approach strikes a balance between independence and protection, ultimately benefiting the young individual's development and preparation for life's challenges.This essay effectively addresses the task by presenting the pros and cons of leaving the family home early, along with the writer's clear opinion. The arguments for and against are organized into coherent paragraphs, supported by relevant examples. While there is room for improvement in terms of expression accuracy and sentence structure, overall, with corrections, this essay has the potential to achieve a high score, such as Band 8 in IELTS.
1333;Some think that young people should be free to choose any career they like, while others say that they should think more realistically about their future. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.;"Choosing a future career requires careful consideration. While some people claim that adolescents should be able to pursue a career they would enjoy, others oppose to that, arguing that teenagers should aim for a high-paying job in order to secure a livelihood when they grow up. Given that our life consists of more than just physiological needs, I strongly believe that it is vital to fulfill one’s potential in the career fields that are most compatible with their interests.The youth who choose highly skilled jobs may find it easier to have a fruitful future in a materialistic sense. It is true that some professions, such as engineers or doctors, are well paid and offer more stability compared to work in other, non-professional fields. For example, psychologists usually have higher starting salaries compared to artists; they also rarely lose their jobs in recessions. People who prioritise earning a living might agree that a reliable job is a must for their future and by no means will they take risks to gain employment in a field they are passionate about, that doesn’t pay well.However, it is worth remembering that we are living in a rapidly changing world and the concept of a ‘guaranteed future’ is unrealistic. Even the smartest of us aren’t prophets and it is impossible to foresee many changes in job markets in the future; some high-salaried jobs of today may no longer exist by the time our young people become adults. Therefore, people may choose to pursue their dreams and follow career paths according to their passions and interests now, to avoid having regrets later in life.Having considered the reasons to prefer monetary remuneration over one’s interests, I am convinced that it would be a pity for youths to limit their career choices to highly paid jobs of today. Unforeseen changes in the jobs markets may affect salaries but won’t change the pleasure one derives from doing something they love.";"The process of selecting a future career is one that demands thoughtful deliberation. There is an ongoing debate between those who believe adolescents should pursue careers that bring them joy and those who argue that financial stability should be the primary consideration, with the goal of securing a livelihood as they mature. However, I firmly believe that fulfilling one's potential in a field that aligns with their passions is essential, given that life encompasses more than just basic physiological needs.It's true that certain professions, such as engineering or medicine, offer higher pay and greater stability compared to non-professional fields. For instance, psychologists generally have higher starting salaries than artists and are less likely to face job loss during economic downturns. Individuals prioritizing financial security may view a reliable job as a necessity for their future, and thus, may be hesitant to take risks by pursuing a field they are passionate about if it doesn't offer substantial financial rewards.Nevertheless, it's crucial to acknowledge that we live in a world characterized by rapid change, making the concept of a ""guaranteed future"" unrealistic. Even the most intelligent among us cannot predict all the changes that will occur in future job markets; some high-paying jobs of today may cease to exist by the time the current youth enter adulthood. Therefore, it might be wise for individuals to follow their dreams and pursue career paths that align with their passions and interests, thereby avoiding potential regrets later in life.After weighing the arguments in favor of prioritizing monetary compensation over personal interests, I am convinced that it would be unfortunate for young people to restrict their career choices to highly paid jobs alone. Unforeseen shifts in job markets may impact salaries, but they will not diminish the satisfaction derived from engaging in work that one loves. Pursuing a career that aligns with one's passions can lead to a more fulfilling life, regardless of the financial fluctuations that may occur."
1403;Students from rural areas often find it difficult to access university education. Some people think that it should become easier for them to study at universities. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Nowadays, it is acknowledged that students from suburban areas find it tough to receive higher education. Whether it should be made easier for them to access university education becomes an ongoing concern, which incurs a highly-charged debate.Obviously, higher education opportunities bring about benefits to students in multiple ways. For example, higher education becomes increasingly important to senior high school graduates, partly it determines if they have the competitive edge in the job market, and partly because it is seen as a guarantee of a certain level of the mental ability, from the computer literacy that is required by the most employers to the capacities of acquiring new knowledge the soonest possible which is valued by most . With a university degree, students from rural areas obtain a job easily, thereby bettering their living conditions and their family as well.Higher education also, however, to impose a heavy burden on families since the rise in the tuition fees are increasingly beyond those families’ ability to afford. In addition, with the mounting evidence, a university degree is not always a guarantee of seizing a decent job; therefore, their living conditions are likely to able to earn back their tuition fee after graduation. people argue, students from rural areas are not well-advised to pursue a university degree. But I perceive their desire to further their education should not be disrespected and the government should subsidise them to receive higher education.In conclusion, university education should be made fair to everyone, predicated only on their academic performance and mental abilities, rather than their financial capacities and the government should subsidise those students in need.Teacher’s comment: Not all the parts of the task were covered. The writer’s position is relevant to task prompt, the main ideas are also relevant but not all of them are developed well enough. The information is presented coherently, it is evident that the writer progresses from one idea to another.";It is widely acknowledged that students from suburban areas face significant challenges in accessing higher education, sparking a heated debate about whether it should be made more accessible to them. Higher education offers numerous benefits to students, including enhanced job prospects and improved mental abilities. For senior high school graduates, higher education is crucial in providing a competitive edge in the job market and demonstrating a certain level of mental ability, such as computer literacy and the capacity to acquire new knowledge. With a university degree, students from rural areas can secure employment more easily, leading to improved living conditions for themselves and their families.However, higher education also imposes a substantial financial burden on families, as rising tuition fees often exceed their ability to pay. Furthermore, a university degree does not guarantee a decent job, making it challenging for graduates to recoup their tuition fees. Some argue that students from rural areas are ill-advised to pursue higher education, given the potential financial risks. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that their desire to further their education should be respected and supported. The government should provide subsidies to enable these students to access higher education.In conclusion, university education should be made accessible to everyone based on their academic performance and mental abilities, rather than their financial capacity. The government has a critical role to play in subsidizing students in need, ensuring that higher education is fair and equitable for all.I made the following changes:* Reorganized the text to improve coherence and flow* Added transitional phrases to connect ideas between sentences* Developed the main ideas more fully, providing more supporting evidence and examples* Strengthened the writer's position and argument* Improved sentence structure and grammar* Added a clear conclusion that summarizes the main points and reiterates the writer's position.
809;The Internet is now used all around the world as a source of information and communication. However, it's often controversial, so many people think it needs to be controlled. Others believe there should be no interference whatsoever.Discuss both points of view, and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The Internet has recently become the most widely spread means of communication and knowledge sharing. It is argued by many if any restrictions should be imposed on it. This essay will discuss both views and explain why the Internet should be free from regulations.One group of people consider that the Internet was developed to overcome a government censure, thus any restrictions will destroy its purpose. Despite the fact that there were independent media, it was practically difficult to share news internally and internationally because of low speed of communication methods such as telegraph or post, which lead to the fact that the most common source of information was government authorities who selected the information they wanted to share. Thus, general citizens’ opinion, views and problems were often unheard. This essay agrees that the ability of sharing information freely between people all over the world makes the government to be transparent as everyone’s opinion and problem may be heard. For example, the problems with extinction of wild animals in Baikal region of Russia due to forest cuts was heard only after a massive attack by the media and local citizens and bloggers that would be impossible without the Internet.The others insist that the Internet allows to people share not only useful knowledge, problems and new, but also violent content. The supporters of the view believe that having an easy access to such content, for example assault, production of bombs, people become prompt to criminal behaviour. Although, the Internet makes the violent information more available, the essay suggests that if an individual want to find violent information, he would do it even in the absence of the Internet. Moreover, recent researches conducted by criminalists uncovered that the increase in the number of criminal offenses is not directly correlated with Internet coverage.In conclusion, although the Internet contains violent content, if needed it may be accessed by interested people from other sources of informations, meanwhile independent flow of information allows individuals to attract attention to their local and even global problems which may be hidden by governments without free Internet.;The internet has become the most pervasive means of communication and knowledge sharing in recent times, sparking debates about whether it should be subject to any restrictions. This essay aims to explore both sides of the argument and provide reasons why the internet should remain unregulated.One perspective is that the internet was originally created to circumvent government censorship, and thus, imposing any restrictions would undermine its fundamental purpose. Historically, even with the existence of independent media, sharing news both domestically and internationally was challenging due to the slow pace of communication methods like the telegraph or postal service. This led to government authorities being the primary sources of information, selectively sharing what they deemed appropriate. Consequently, the opinions, views, and concerns of ordinary citizens often went unheard. This essay concurs that the internet's ability to facilitate the free exchange of information globally makes governments more transparent, as it amplifies everyone's opinions and problems. For instance, issues like the extinction of wild animals in Russia's Baikal region due to deforestation gained international attention only after widespread media coverage and activism by local citizens and bloggers, which would have been impossible without the internet.On the other hand, there are those who argue that the internet not only allows the sharing of useful knowledge and problems but also enables the dissemination of violent content. Proponents of regulation believe that easy access to such content, like assault or bomb-making instructions, predisposes individuals to criminal behavior. While it is true that the internet makes violent information more accessible, this essay posits that individuals inclined to seek out such information would find ways to do so even without the internet. Furthermore, recent criminological research indicates that the increase in criminal offenses is not directly correlated with internet access.In conclusion, although the internet does contain violent content, those seeking it can find it through other means if needed. Meanwhile, the unencumbered flow of information on the internet allows individuals to draw attention to local and global issues that might otherwise be suppressed by governments. This underscores the importance of keeping the internet free from regulations to ensure that it continues to serve as a powerful tool for transparency and the expression of diverse voices.
1397;The Internet when used as a source of information, has more drawbacks than advantages. To what extent do you agree with this statement?;Some people believe that internet access creates problems. There are several possible reasons why it can happen.Firstly, some data may be unverifiable. For example, they search for a data, there would be lots of choices that would appear on the screen. They would not be sure if the information they are reading is accurate. Some sources may even have outdated . Secondly, some sites may be unreliable. For instance, people sign up on one site that sells goods online. The goods would be paid for by a credit card, but the purchaser would not receive anything. And finally, not everything is available through the net. When my friend had tried to research for some pictures of 18th century paintings, he did not find any results. Then he was told by his teacher that they would only be available in the library.Others believe that the Internet is very useful and these are the justifications. Firstly, it is hard to get the same data, that is available through the Internet by other means. For example, if the directory information could not give me the accurate address and contact number of a place I to visit, I normally check that information on the Internet. In just one click, I would get all the details of that company. Secondly, research becomes more comprehensive. For instance, I do not have to buy lots of reading materials to complete my research. Most of the needed information can be found if I have Internet access. And finally, data is easily compared and contrasted. researched a study about overweight children a decade ago and at presentwas able to finish his research in just one day, as compared to a week if he would not use the Internet.In conclusion, let me reiterate that the Internet plays a big role in our life, because it makes data retrieval and comparison easier.;The impact of internet access on our lives is a topic of debate. Some individuals believe that it creates problems, citing several reasons. Firstly, the abundance of information available online can lead to issues with data verification. When searching for information, users are often presented with numerous options, making it difficult to determine the accuracy of the content. Furthermore, some sources may provide outdated information, which can be misleading. Secondly, the reliability of certain websites is a concern. For instance, online shopping platforms may not always deliver on their promises, with customers paying for goods they never receive. Lastly, not all information is accessible online, as evidenced by a friend's experience searching for 18th century paintings, which were only available in a library.On the other hand, many people argue that the internet is highly useful, and they offer several justifications. Firstly, the internet provides unparalleled access to information that would be difficult or time-consuming to obtain through other means. For example, directory information may not always be accurate or up-to-date, but a quick internet search can provide the necessary details. Secondly, the internet facilitates more comprehensive research, as it eliminates the need to purchase numerous reading materials. Most of the required information can be found online, making research more efficient. Finally, the internet enables easy comparison and contrast of data, as seen in a study on overweight children, where research that would have taken a week to complete was finished in just one day thanks to online access.In conclusion, the internet plays a significant role in our lives, making data retrieval and comparison easier and more efficient. While there are potential drawbacks to internet access, the benefits and justifications provided demonstrate its value and importance in our daily lives.

109;The advantages of the spread of English as a global language will continue to outweigh its disadvantages. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;In today's life, English is one of the biggest common language in the world. It is often argued that the benefits of learning English as a global language will superior to its drawbacks continueously. I completely agree with this idea due to the fact that English is one of the easiest language to learn and most education system in the world involve English as one of the courses.English should be continue to use as a global langauge because it is easy to learn. Each language in the world involves different movings of the tongue in the mouth, but some of the languages have similar tongue positions with English, such as Italian, Spanish and French. It will be difficult for people in the world to start adapting a new language and using completely different tongue positions. For example, chinese, one of the most challengeable langauge in the world, it mostly does not need the support of the tongue to touch the teeth or anything else. It is hard for people with other mother language to adapt the pronounciation. Therefore, one of the biggest advantages of English as a common language is the easyness of it.In addition to the easyness of English, numorous education systems in the world include English as one of the important subjects to learn support the benefits of English that will continue to overseed its disadvantages. Since English as one of the spreading languages in the world lasts for many years. A lots of generations learn English since their childhood and English already take a huge part of their educational studies. It is hard for people to abandon this language and step out of their comfort zone. For instance, one of my best chilldhood friend learn English for almost 6 years, but since she went to Spain for two years as exchange students, she get used to the way of learn English, instead of Spanish, so she fell her grade there. It is clear that English as one of the essential courses in world, it has an important connection with the education system globally and it has a huge influence in our studies.In conclusion, the easyness of learning English and the crucial role of it in the educations system support my opinion that I completely believe that the advantages of spreading English as an important language in the world will keep outweigh its flaws.;In today's globalized world, English has emerged as one of the most widely spoken languages. Many argue that the benefits of learning English as a global language far outweigh its drawbacks, and I wholeheartedly agree. One of the primary reasons for this is that English is considered one of the easiest languages to learn, and it is a staple in most education systems around the world.The continued use of English as a global language is justified by its relative ease of learning. Unlike some languages, which require unique tongue positions and mouth movements, English shares similarities with languages like Italian, Spanish, and French. For instance, languages like Chinese, which demand distinct pronunciation techniques, can be challenging for non-native speakers to adapt to. In contrast, English pronunciation is relatively straightforward, making it an ideal choice as a common language.Furthermore, numerous education systems worldwide incorporate English as a crucial subject, underscoring its significance and reinforcing its advantages over its disadvantages. As English has been a dominant language for many years, successive generations have grown up learning it from a young age, and it has become an integral part of their educational curriculum. It is therefore difficult for people to abandon English and venture out of their comfort zone. For example, a childhood friend of mine, who had learned English for nearly six years, struggled to adapt to the Spanish education system when she spent two years in Spain as an exchange student. Her experience illustrates the profound influence of English on our educational systems globally.In conclusion, the ease of learning English, combined with its pivotal role in education systems worldwide, solidifies my conviction that the advantages of promoting English as a global language will continue to outweigh its flaws. I firmly believe that English will remain a vital language in the world, and its benefits will persist in surpassing its drawbacks.
248;The bar chart below describes some changes about the percentage of people were born in Australia and who were born outside Australia living in urban, rural and town between 1995 and 2010.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;this above bar chart it is depicts the percent flock of people born in Australia otherwise people was born outside , it is clarify from the graph that we leer the a several of bars will making comparsing between them , according what is elucidate in 1995 we noitced the citzens are more likely to accomndtion into cities and also rural , for example we see nearly 50 prepertion whear as 20% in rural and comparsing to the 2010 i think the bar of cities it is kind of rise , in other hand we have very significantly decrease in rural , while the people are born out nation in 1995 it is prefer to live in cities etheir , we see the bar it is 60 percent and he is growing up very observe which in 2010 they have 80% , finaily to sum up we could say that it is very common to see like this digram bar.;The bar chart above depicts the percentage of people born in Australia versus those born outside of Australia. From the graph, it is clear that we can learn a lot by comparing the various bars. According to the data from 1995, citizens are more likely to settle in cities than in rural areas. For example, we see that nearly 50% of people born in Australia live in cities, whereas only 20% live in rural areas. In comparison, by 2010, the bar for cities appears to have risen. On the other hand, there is a significant decrease in rural areas. As for people born outside of Australia, in 1995, they seemed to prefer living in cities, with 60% of them residing in urban areas. This trend continued to grow, and by 2010, it had increased to 80%. In conclusion, it is common to observe trends like this in bar charts.
1170;The bar chart below gives information about vehicle ownership in China.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information.;The chart describes the data about vehicle ownership in a particular country, China from 1987 to 1999.Overall, the highest vehicle ownership occurred in the year 1999 while the lowest trend was recorded in the year 1987.According to the chart, China has less than 500 vehicle per thousand people during 1987. It is evident that there is an increment in the figures throughout the years. Within the two year interval, the number of vehicle ownership was already at 500. In 1991, 900 vehicle per thousand people were already in possession as depicted in the graph. In between 1991 to 1995, it went up gradually to nearly a thousand. Furthermore, the vehicle ownership doubled in number in 1995. Also, in an unspecified period of time, the number of vehicle possession in that country were approximately 3,000. By the end of year 1999, the numbers rose significantly to 4,100 vehicle per thousand people.;The chart illustrates vehicle ownership data in China from 1987 to 1999. According to the chart, the country experienced a significant increase in vehicle ownership over the 12-year period, with the highest rate occurring in 1999 and the lowest in 1987. In 1987, China had fewer than 500 vehicles per 1,000 people. However, the numbers showed a steady increase over the years. By the next recorded interval, the number of vehicles per 1,000 people had already surpassed 500. By 1991, this number had risen to 900, as indicated on the graph. Between 1991 and 1995, vehicle ownership continued to rise gradually, nearing 1,000 vehicles per 1,000 people. Notably, the number of vehicles more than doubled by 1995. At some point, the country's vehicle ownership reached approximately 3,000 vehicles per 1,000 people. By the end of 1999, the number had increased substantially to 4,100 vehicles per 1,000 people, marking the highest vehicle ownership rate for the period in question.
702;The bar chart below shows the number of houses built per year in two cities, Derby and Nottingham, Between 2000 and 2009. Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.You should write at least 150 words.;Information is presented by the bar chart which illustrates the figure for houses built each year in Derby and Nottingham over a ten-year period from 2000 to 2009. Overall, it can be seen that there was a clear trend that houses in Derby were built more than that in Nottingham each year over the survey period, except for the year 2000, 2001 and 2007.Turning to the first main feature, there were just under 50 houses which were constructed in Derby for the first two years between 2000 and 2001, while the number of houses in Nottingham was an exact 50 and a little more than 50 in 2000 and 2001 respectively. The figure for houses in Derby then increased considerably to approximately 75 in 2002, which exceeded the number of houses in Nottingham, and plateaued at more than 100 until 2006. On the contrary, in 2002 the chart depicts a noticeable decline in the number of houses in Nottingham to less than 25. Nevertheless, the number of houses in Nottingham rebounded and rose to around 75 in 2005 before dropping suddenly to nearly zero in 2006.Turning to another main feature, whereas in 2007 the figure for houses in Derby remained unchanged at above 100, the number of houses in Nottingham soared to almost 200, exceeding the number of houses in Derby. The last key feature to point out is that the number of houses in Derby jumped dramatically to nearly 350 by 2009 while the number of houses in Nottingham experienced the third drop to almost zero in 2008 before the number of houses in Nottingham increased dramatically to 250 in 2009.;The bar chart provides information on the number of houses built annually in Derby and Nottingham over a decade, from 2000 to 2009. A clear trend emerges, with Derby generally having more houses built each year than Nottingham, except in 2000, 2001, and 2007.Initially, between 2000 and 2001, Derby had just under 50 houses constructed, while Nottingham had exactly 50 and slightly more than 50 houses built in those respective years. However, the number of houses in Derby surged to around 75 in 2002, surpassing Nottingham's figure, and remained above 100 until 2006. In contrast, Nottingham experienced a significant decline to less than 25 houses in 2002. Nevertheless, the number of houses in Nottingham recovered and increased to approximately 75 by 2005, only to plummet to near zero in 2006.Another notable aspect is that in 2007, while Derby's house construction figure remained steady above 100, Nottingham's number skyrocketed to nearly 200, exceeding Derby's. Finally, by 2009, Derby's house construction figure leaped to almost 350, whereas Nottingham's figure experienced a third significant drop to almost zero in 2008, before dramatically increasing to 250 in 2009.
530;The bar chart below shows the numbers of men and women attending various evening courses at an adult education centre in the year 2009. The pie chart gives information about the ages of these course participants.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar chart shows what are the tendences of men and women in attending evening courses in an adult education centre during 2009 in a scale of 0 to 40 people, while the pie chart shows the percentages of ages of the participants in these courses.Fist of all, the most striking information is that women were largely more present in languages and painting courses than men, and that the vast majority of the participants in the overall courses were 50 years old or over.To begin with, it is clearly demonstrated that there were more women than men in all courses, except in sculture. In fact, men attended to language and drama courses were twice as less than women. Women were 40 in language courses and 20 in drama. Men were also slightly less in paiting, around 25 people, compared to women who were 30 at this course. However, in sculpture, men tended to be more present, as they were 10, which is roughly the double of the number of women who were present.Secondly, there was a marked tendence for people aged from 50 and over to attend a these courses, as they were slighlty more than two fifth. Just over a quarter of the people were between 40 and 49, while those who were 30-39 were just 16%. Finally, the youngest ones were not very present. In fact, the 20-29 years old group represented just 11%, while the under 20 were barely the half, with 5%.To conclude, it can be seen that the vast majority of the people who attended these evening courses were aged from 40 to 50 and over. Moreover, women tended to attend much more at all courses than men except for sculpture.;The bar chart illustrates the attendance trends of men and women in evening courses at an adult education centre in 2009, with a scale of 0 to 40 people. In contrast, the pie chart displays the age distribution of participants in these courses as a percentage.Notably, the most striking finding is that women outnumbered men in language and painting courses, and that the majority of participants across all courses were 50 years old or older.Initially, it is evident that women outnumbered men in all courses, except for sculpture. In fact, men's attendance in language and drama courses was roughly half that of women's. Specifically, 40 women attended language courses, while 20 attended drama courses. Men's attendance was slightly lower in painting, with around 25 attendees, compared to 30 women. However, men were more prevalent in sculpture, with 10 attendees, which is approximately double the number of women.Furthermore, there is a noticeable tendency for people aged 50 and over to attend these courses, making up slightly more than two-fifths of the total. Approximately a quarter of attendees were between 40 and 49 years old, while those aged 30-39 comprised 16%. The youngest age group, 20-29 years old, accounted for 11%, and those under 20 were barely present, making up only 5%.In conclusion, it is clear that the vast majority of attendees were aged 40 to 50 and older. Moreover, women were more likely to attend all courses, except for sculpture, where men had a higher attendance rate.
960;The bar chart below shows the percentage of unemployed graduates, aged 20-24, in one European country over a two-year period.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and making comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart demonstrates the unemployed graduates who are between 20 and 24 years old by gender in percentage. The survey is conducted in one European country from 2008 to 2009.In general, the unemployment rates in males over a two-year period were higher than the females. The highest rate of unemployment in males was approximately 22% in Oct 2009, reaching nearly 40% more than females. Whereas the unemployment for female graduates in percentage was 6% reported in Apr 08, July 08 and Apr 09 which were the lowest rate of unemployment for graduates over the period.First of all, there was a slight decline in the unemployment rates for all graduates in the beginning of year, from 10% in Jan 08 to 7% in Apr 08 in males whilst female graduates decreasing from 7.5% to 6% . The unemployment for both genders in July 2008 remained same rates as previous. An increase in percentage of unemployed graduates in Oct 08 took nearly twofold of last month with males by 16% and females by 11%. Subsequently, a fall in the unemployment rates for all graduates were recorded in Jan 09, by 12.5% in men and 8% in women. A further reduction in the rate of unemployed female graduates in Apr 09 was 6% whilst there was no change in the male graduates. Afterwards, the unemployment rates in women returned to 10% in July 09 whereas there was a brief decrease in males by 11%. This was followed by a surge in the unemployment rates for graduates in Oct 09 by 22% for males and 14% for females.;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of unemployed graduates between the ages of 20 and 24, categorized by gender, based on a survey conducted in a European country from 2008 to 2009. Generally, the male unemployment rates surpassed those of females over the two-year period. The peak male unemployment rate was around 22% in October 2009, which was nearly 40% higher than the female rate. In contrast, the lowest female graduate unemployment rate was 6%, recorded in April 2008, July 2008, and April 2009.At the beginning of the period, there was a slight decrease in unemployment rates for all graduates. Male unemployment decreased from 10% in January 2008 to 7% in April 2008, while female graduate unemployment decreased from 7.5% to 6%. The unemployment rates for both genders remained stable in July 2008. However, in October 2008, there was a significant increase in unemployment, with male rates doubling to 16% and female rates rising to 11%.In January 2009, the unemployment rates for all graduates declined, with male rates decreasing to 12.5% and female rates to 8%. By April 2009, the female graduate unemployment rate further decreased to 6%, while the male rate remained unchanged. Later, in July 2009, female unemployment rates rose to 10%, whereas male rates briefly decreased to 11%. Finally, in October 2009, there was a notable surge in graduate unemployment, with male rates reaching 22% and female rates reaching 14%.
688;The bar chart below shows the total number of minutes (in billions) of telephone calls in Australia, divided into three categories, from 2001- 2008. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The bar chart displays the total number of minutes(in billions) of telephone calls in Australia. There are three types, specifically, local, national and international, and mobiles. Overall, it is clear the number of local telephone calls has the largest from 2001 to 2008, while the other two types, national and international, and mobiles steadily increased the number of telephone calls.Initially, there is a variation in local telephone calls from 2001 to 2008. The number of telephone calls started at 72 billion, and steadily soared and reached a peak of 90 billion in 2005. Then the number of billions slightly reduced and returned to 72 billion in 2008. Nevertheless, the number remained the highest in the three categories.Secondly, national and international, and mobiles can be seen steadily increase the number until 2008. National and international was 38 billion in 2001 and gradually rose up the number and reached the highest number in 2008. Specifically, it was 61 billion. Mobiles started the number only 2 billion in 2001. But the number constantly increased, and suddenly surged to 23 billion and 39 billion in 2006 and 2007 respectively. As a result, the number reached a peak of 46 billion in 2008. The gaps among three categories were quite large in 2001. It was 72, 38, and 2 in local, national and international mobile. And it resulted in a huge reduction of the gap in 2008. It was 72,61, and 46 in local,national and internationalal, and mobiles.;The bar chart illustrates the total number of minutes (in billions) of telephone calls in Australia, categorizing them into local, national and international, and mobile calls. From 2001 to 2008, it is evident that local telephone calls dominated the others, while national and international, and mobile calls consistently showed an increase in their numbers.The chart reveals a fluctuation in local telephone calls between 2001 and 2008. Starting at 72 billion minutes in 2001, the number of local calls steadily rose to reach a peak of 90 billion minutes in 2005, before slightly decreasing back to 72 billion minutes in 2008. Nonetheless, local calls maintained the highest numbers among the three categories throughout the period.In contrast, national and international calls, as well as mobile calls, displayed a steady increase until 2008. National and international calls began at 38 billion minutes in 2001 and gradually rose to reach 61 billion minutes in 2008, marking the highest point. Mobile calls started with a significantly lower number of 2 billion minutes in 2001 but consistently increased, surging to 23 billion and 39 billion minutes in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Consequently, mobile calls peaked at 46 billion minutes in 2008.Notably, the discrepancies among the three categories were substantial in 2001, with 72 billion minutes for local, 38 billion for national and international, and 2 billion for mobile calls. However, by 2008, these gaps had significantly narrowed, with the numbers standing at 72 billion for local, 61 billion for national and international, and 46 billion for mobile calls, indicating a marked reduction in the disparity between the categories over the observed period.
362;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of how parents in a country spent time taking care of their children in the evening in 2022. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The bar chart demonstrates the proportions in which how parents spent time looking after their kids in the evening in the country, during the year 2022. The figures are given in percentage of time. Overall, there are four activities, including dressing, homework, playing games, and preparing for bed. which can be roughly classified into two groups. On one hand, mothers mainly oversee their children for dressing and homework with some helps from fathers, on the other hand, playing games and preparing for bed are done by both parents. Obviously, fathers spent time significantly less than mothers in all activities.To begin, The proportion of mothers taking care of theri children by dressing was approximately 75 percent which is the majority in the task. Likewise, around a half of homeworks were done by mothers while it was the acitivity which fathers take the most at about 10%.In contrast, both parents mainly took care of their children together to play games and to prepare for bed. Specifically, they both played games with their kids and prepared fot bed around 70 and 50 percent of time respectively. Furthermore, mothers spent 40 percent of time to prepare for bed.;The bar chart illustrates the distribution of time spent by parents on childcare activities in the evening in 2022. The data is presented as a percentage of time allocated to each activity. There are four primary activities: dressing, homework, playing games, and preparing for bed, which can be broadly categorized into two groups. On one hand, mothers primarily take care of dressing and homework, with some assistance from fathers. On the other hand, playing games and preparing for bed are activities where both parents are involved. Notably, fathers spend significantly less time than mothers on all activities.To elaborate, mothers dedicate approximately 75% of the time to dressing their children, which is the majority share of this task. Similarly, mothers handle about half of the homework, while fathers participate at around 10%, which is the highest level of involvement for fathers among all activities.In contrast, both parents predominantly engage in playing games and preparing for bed together. Specifically, they jointly spend around 70% and 50% of the time playing games with and preparing their children for bed, respectively. Moreover, mothers allocate an additional 40% of their time to preparing their children for bed. This indicates a shared responsibility in certain activities, while mothers take on a more substantial role in others.
626;The bar chart shows the percentage of the total world population in 4 countries in 1950 and 2002, and projections for 2050.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart depicts the proportion of the total world population in 4 countries in 1950 and 2002, and predictions for 2050. Overall, it can be seen India and China occupy much higher percentage in all periods while the USA, and Japan tend to be much smaller and drop down in 2002.It is clear that India steadily increases the percentage of its population since 1950. Specifically, the percentage in each period is 15 percent, around 17 percent, and will be approximately 18 percent, in 1950, 2002, and 2050 respectively. In contrast, China used to be the highest percentage of population in 1950 and 2002. The each percentage indicates more than 23 percent in 1950 and dropped to 20 percent in 2002. Furthermore, the prediction about population will plummet to 15 percent.Interestingly, firstly Japan was the smallest percentage in 4 countries in 1950 and slightly goes down in 2002. The percentage seems to be about 4 percent in 1950 and its percentage will plummet to approximately 1 percent in 2050. The USA also goes down population 5 percent in 2002, but the percentage will stay the same in 2050.;The bar chart illustrates the proportion of the world's total population residing in four countries - India, China, the USA, and Japan - for the years 1950 and 2002, along with projected figures for 2050. Generally, it is evident that India and China account for a significantly higher percentage of the population across all periods, whereas the USA and Japan constitute a much smaller proportion, with their percentages declining by 2002.A notable trend is that India's population percentage has been steadily increasing since 1950. Specifically, the country's population percentage was approximately 15% in 1950, rose to around 17% in 2002, and is predicted to reach about 18% by 2050. In contrast, China had the highest population percentage in both 1950 and 2002, with more than 23% in 1950, which then decreased to 20% in 2002. Furthermore, predictions indicate that China's population percentage will drop further to 15% by 2050.Interestingly, Japan initially had the smallest population percentage among the four countries in 1950, with a percentage of about 4%, and this decreased slightly by 2002. The prediction for 2050 indicates a significant drop to approximately 1%. The USA's population percentage also decreased to 5% by 2002, but it is expected to remain stable at the same percentage by 2050.
1136;The bar chart shows the scores of teams A, B and C over four different seasons.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The graphic gives information about the scores obtained by three teams (A, B and C) in four seasons. Team B compared to the other two is that obtained more points over the years. On the other hand, teams A and B mantain their scores low. 2004 is the year in which there is less discrepancy in the scores of the three teams. Instead, in 2002 there is more disparity.Over the years the three teams always modify their score. The score of each of the teams rises and then goes down. For instance, the scores of team A is that subjected to more modifications. It start very low. In 2003 were registered an increase and then the points rapidly go up in 2003. The scores changed from 11 points to 35. After that, the points start to diminish again. Team B obtained always the highest scores over the years. However also this team's score is subject to various change. The score was very high in 2002 and is just 43 in 2004. In 2005 the score raises again. Team C totalise the lowest score over the years, and the scores are subjected just to small variations.2004 is the year in which there is less disparity between the score of team B and the other two. Team A in 2004 had totalised 35 point and team B only 8 point more. Even if the points of team C are 12, the overall score's dicrepancy is less than in other year. Indeed, in 2002 there is a huge dicrepancy concerning the scores of the teams. Team B obtained 82 points while the other two teams obtained respectively 5 points (team A) and 10 points (team B).;The graph provides information on the scores achieved by three teams, A, B, and C, over a period of four seasons. Notably, Team B consistently outperforms the other two teams, obtaining the highest points over the years. In contrast, Teams A and C maintain relatively low scores. The year 2004 stands out as the season with the least discrepancy in scores among the three teams, whereas 2002 shows the greatest disparity.Throughout the seasons, each team's score undergoes fluctuations, with periods of increase followed by decline. Team A's score is particularly volatile, starting very low. In 2003, Team A's score surged from 11 points to 35 points, only to decrease again in subsequent years. Team B consistently achieves the highest scores, yet its score also varies significantly. For example, it was very high in 2002, dropped to 43 in 2004, and then increased again in 2005. Team C consistently records the lowest scores, with only minor variations over the years.The year 2004 is notable for having the smallest gap in scores between Team B and the other two teams. In 2004, Team A scored 35 points, while Team B scored only 8 points more, at 43. Even with Team C's score being 12 points, the overall discrepancy in scores is less pronounced compared to other years. Conversely, 2002 saw a significant disparity in team scores. Team B achieved 82 points, while Team A and Team C scored 5 and 10 points, respectively, highlighting a substantial gap in performance among the teams that year.
272;The bar charts below show the number of hours each teacher spent teaching in different schools in four different countries in 2001.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar graph illustrates the amount of teaching hours of teacher in primary, lower secondary and upper secondary schools in Japan, Spain, Iceland and the USA. It's clearly can seen the teacher who teach higher students spend time to teach more than lower.In european countries, their teacher have to teach nearly hours in upper secondary schools at 900 hours. Thus, Iceland and Spain still has big gap in primary and lower secondary schools. The teacher in primary schools in Iceland spend almost 600 hours which shorter time than Spain (more than 600 hours). Same way in lower secondary schools, Iceland and Spain teacher spend 600 and 750 hours, respectively.In other countries, teachers in Japan spend the smallest time of four countries in average at 600, 625 and 650 hours. In the USA, teachers spend the largest time of teaching at 625, 950 and almost 1200 hours in primary lower secondary and upper secondary schools.;The bar graph depicts the number of teaching hours for teachers in primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary schools in Japan, Spain, Iceland, and the USA. It is clear that teachers who instruct higher-level students spend more time teaching than those who teach lower-level students.In European countries, teachers are required to teach nearly 900 hours in upper secondary schools. Consequently, Iceland and Spain still have a significant gap in teaching hours for primary and lower secondary schools. Teachers in primary schools in Iceland spend approximately 600 hours, which is less than in Spain (more than 600 hours). Similarly, in lower secondary schools, teachers in Iceland and Spain spend 600 and 750 hours, respectively.In comparison, teachers in Japan spend the least amount of time teaching among the four countries, with averages of 600, 625, and 650 hours. On the other hand, teachers in the USA spend the most time teaching, with 625, 950, and nearly 1200 hours in primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary schools, respectively.
314;The bar charts below shows the number of visits to a community website in the first and second year of use.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and mae comparisons with relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the quantity of visits by the thousands paid to a community website within the first two years of use.Overall, there is a greater upward trend from the second year of use compared to the first year of use. In addition to that, in both years the website undergoes a drastic fluctuation in numbers. It can be observed that initially in the month of September, number of visits in the first year of use are lower than second year of use, but numbers of the former subsequently surpasses the latter in the final month of August.In regards to the first year of use, quantity of visits increases from about 2000 visits in September to 10000 visits within 2 months and remains constant for another month. Following that, numbers plummet from December to February, reaching a low-point of less than approximately 500 visits. The numbers rise gradually from February onwards until it reaches it's highest at 15000 by August.On the other hand, during the second year of use, the number of visits rises sharply from about 2500 visits to around 17500 visits. Soon, the visits dip to 10000 only by February, persisting to March. The trend then increases steadily until it touches roughly 22500 visits in July, but drops once again to less than 13000.;The bar chart depicts the number of visits, in thousands, to a community website over its first two years of operation. A notable upward trend is evident in the second year, outpacing the growth seen in the first year. However, both years exhibit significant fluctuations in visit numbers. Initially, in September, the first year starts with lower visit numbers compared to the second year, but by August, the first year's numbers surpass those of the second year.In the first year, visits began with around 2000 in September and surged to 10,000 within two months, stabilizing for a month before plummeting to under 500 visits by February. From February onwards, the numbers gradually increased to a peak of 15,000 visits by August.Conversely, the second year saw a sharp increase from approximately 2500 visits to about 17,500 visits. This was followed by a dip to 10,000 visits by February, which persisted into March. The trend then steadily rose until reaching around 22,500 visits in July, before dropping again to less than 13,000 visits.
1408;The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise age limit for the younger drivers and to lower age limit for the aged ones. Do you agree?;With the rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the with hush and rush lifestyles of drivers today, traffic accidents seem to be escalating in our society. partly to number of traffic accidents but surely not as the main factor.Those who agree with would view young drivers assuming under 18 years old and older drivers to be reckless and therefore would be more prone to traffic accidents on the road. Lack of experience, forgetfulness, carelessness and poor fitness condition may be reasons for limiting age of drivers.On the other hand, I would think that age is only a small determinant and we need to look at more effective measure such as reducing number of vehicles on the road through car pool, implementing more stringent regulations on alcohol drink driving and possibly to revise on the standard of driving test for young and old drivers on the road. Many drivers who are stuck in traffic jams also have busy lifestyles and therefore tend to become very stressed or distracted on the road. Thus I would think the government may have to look ways to improve road infrastructure and traffic jams to deter or reduce accidents on the road.To sum up, age is only one of the many contributors for accidents but I do not agree that age for the elderly and raising age limit for the younger drivers is the best method. As mentioned in my third paragraph, we need to look at other more effective measures which deal with the underlying problems in the society which lead to traffic accidents.;The rising number of vehicles on the road, combined with the frantic pace of modern life, has led to a surge in traffic accidents in our society. While some may argue that the age of drivers is a significant contributor to these accidents, I believe it is only a minor factor. Proponents of age-based restrictions might point to young drivers under 18 and older drivers as being more prone to accidents due to recklessness, and cite lack of experience, forgetfulness, carelessness, and poor physical fitness as reasons to limit driving ages.However, I think that age is only one of many determinants, and that more effective measures are needed to address the root causes of traffic accidents. These could include reducing the number of vehicles on the road through carpooling, implementing stricter regulations on drunk driving, and revising the standards for driving tests for both young and old drivers. Additionally, many drivers who are stuck in traffic jams have busy lifestyles, leading to stress and distraction on the road. Therefore, I believe the government should focus on improving road infrastructure and alleviating traffic congestion to reduce accidents.In conclusion, while age may be a contributing factor to traffic accidents, I do not think that raising the age limit for young drivers or restricting the driving privileges of older drivers is the most effective solution. Instead, we should explore other measures that address the underlying societal issues that lead to accidents, such as those mentioned earlier. By taking a more comprehensive approach, we can work towards reducing the number of traffic accidents and creating a safer driving environment for all.
1414;The best way to reduce the number of traffic accidents is to raise the age limit for younger drivers and to lower the age limit for aged drivers. Do you agree ?;Traffic accidents are on the rise these days. Most of the accidents injuries or death. Research have found that most of the accidents are caused by inexperienced drivers, for example young drivers.Young drivers tend to be more daring and are unable to avoid a crush when they face one. They tend to be more daring after drinking alcohol at night and this causes them to lose control of the car. Drunk driving will not only risk a person’s own life but may also cause an life to be lost.The government should encourage the driving to conduct driving lessons for drivers for a longer period. This will give them a clear picture about how accidents happen and teach them about the safety of others on the road. Drivers that have been in an accident after drunk driving should be from driving for at least two years and be given driving lessons again.However, for the aged drivers, the government should not only the age limit but also check the capability of the aged drivers for instance eyesight, hearing and other related health conditions to ensure safe driving. It does not mean that an aged person not fit to drive and has a problem with the heart but a young or a middle aged person could also have heart failure these days.To conclude, I feel that to raise the of young drivers not the best solution but to about the problems they may encounter on the road and to ban them from driving if they have caused an accident due to carelessness. As for the drivers, as long as they are capable on the road before a certain age and there are no health issues there shouldn’t be a problem.;Traffic accidents have been increasing in recent times, resulting in a significant number of injuries and fatalities. Research has shown that a large proportion of these accidents are caused by inexperienced drivers, particularly young drivers. Young drivers tend to be more reckless and are often unable to avoid collisions when they occur. Furthermore, they are more likely to engage in risky behavior, such as driving under the influence of alcohol, which can lead to a loss of control over their vehicle. Drunk driving not only puts the driver's own life at risk but also endangers the lives of others on the road.To address this issue, the government should consider extending the duration of driving lessons for new drivers. This would provide them with a better understanding of how accidents occur and emphasize the importance of safety on the road. Additionally, drivers who have been involved in an accident due to drunk driving should be banned from driving for at least two years and required to undergo additional driving lessons.Regarding older drivers, the government should not only consider raising the age limit but also assess their ability to drive safely. This could involve checking their eyesight, hearing, and other health conditions that may affect their driving abilities. It's essential to note that age is not the only factor in determining a person's ability to drive safely, as individuals of any age can have health issues that may impair their driving.In conclusion, I believe that simply raising the driving age limit for young drivers is not the most effective solution. Instead, educating them about the potential hazards they may encounter on the road and revoking their driving privileges if they cause an accident due to reckless behavior may be more effective. As for older drivers, as long as they are capable of driving safely and do not have any underlying health issues, there should be no need to restrict their driving privileges based on age alone.
31;The best way to teach children to cooperate is through team sports at school. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;These days it is firmly believed that the most efficient method to teach children in schools how to work together is through team sports. This essay disagrees with the statement since some young students might not enjoy playing sports and because team sports can raise competitiveness amongst children, hence having a negative impact on their friendly relationships.First of all, although it is vital for a children to play sports and keep fit, not everyone is keen on football, rugby and volleyball. Instead, some young students prefer spending their leisure time on other activities such as joining a chorus group or teathre lessons. These activities can encourage cooperation and make children get along with each other, as well. On the other hand, forcing children to play something they doesn't feel comfortable in can make them withdraw from the team game, which would make them feel excluded.In addition, teams sports do not always promote cooperation among players. In some cases, inequities or particularly ambitious behaviours can lead to violent competitiveness, instead. It is generally thought that sport is an extremely selective environment, in fact you need to exercise daily in order to keep fit. If obese children took part in those team sports as well, they could feel isolated because they do not own the perfect body to perform well.In conclusion, although team sports are a great method to teach children how to get along with each other, there are various activities which can encourage cooperation among children, as well. Therefore, it is considerably significant for a school to embrace diversity and make children play with what they really like, instead of forcing them to do something they feel they don't belong.;The idea that team sports are the most effective way to teach children to work together in a school setting is a widely held belief. However, this essay argues against this notion, suggesting that not all children enjoy participating in sports and that team sports can actually foster competitiveness among youngsters, potentially damaging their friendships.To begin with, while it's crucial for children to engage in physical activity to stay fit, not every child is interested in sports like football, rugby, or volleyball. Many young students prefer to spend their free time on other activities, such as joining a choir or taking theater lessons. These alternative activities can also promote teamwork and camaraderie among children. Forcing children to participate in sports they're not comfortable with can lead to them feeling left out or withdrawing from the team, which can be alienating.Moreover, team sports do not always encourage cooperation among players. In some instances, unfairness or overly aggressive behavior can lead to cutthroat competition instead. The sports environment is often highly selective, requiring daily exercise to maintain fitness. This can be particularly challenging for children who are overweight, as they may feel isolated or self-conscious about their abilities, leading to feelings of exclusion.In conclusion, while team sports can be an excellent way to teach children about teamwork, there are numerous other activities that can also foster cooperation among youngsters. Therefore, it's essential for schools to embrace diversity and allow children to participate in activities they genuinely enjoy, rather than forcing them into situations where they may feel like they don't belong. This approach will help create a more inclusive and supportive environment, where all children can thrive and develop valuable social skills.
982;The chart and table below give information about population figures in Japan.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar graph and table provide information about population numbers of past, present and future in Japan from in the year of 1950 to 2055. It can be observed that numbers of total population and elderly people changes between these years.Overall, Japan's population rose until 2005 and drops from that point as future prediction indicates. Likewise, the population of aged 65 or over rose until certain point.Taking a closer look at the graph, it can be seen that population is increased regularly from 1950 to 2005. While it was 84.1 millions in the year 1950, it is peaked in 2005 with reaching 127.8 millions. However, it will decrease from 2005 to 2055 with reaching 89.9 millions.On the other hand, if we look at the table, we can see that elderly people's population rose from 4.1 millions in 1950 to 25.7 million in 2005. The increase is expected until 2035 with predicting to reach 37.2 millions, however, it would drop to 36.5 millions in 2055.;The bar graph and table illustrate the population trends in Japan from 1950 to 2055, highlighting the changes in total population and the number of elderly individuals over the years. An overview of the data reveals that Japan's population experienced an increase until 2005, after which it began to decline, as predicted by future projections. Similarly, the population of people aged 65 and above also rose until a certain point.A closer examination of the graph shows that the population grew steadily from 1950 to 2005. The total population was 84.1 million in 1950 and peaked at 127.8 million in 2005. However, it is expected to decrease from 2005 to 2055, reaching 89.9 million.In contrast, the table indicates that the population of elderly individuals (65 and above) increased from 4.1 million in 1950 to 25.7 million in 2005. This growth is expected to continue until 2035, with a predicted peak of 37.2 million, before slightly decreasing to 36.5 million by 2055.
664;The chart below gives information about global population percentages and distribution of wealth by region.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The chart indicates information about global population percentages and distribution of wealth by eight regions. Clearly, three regions contribute to global wealth remarkably higher than others, while the five regions' distribution of wealth is all less than five percent.To begin with, these three regions, North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacefic can be seen much high percentage. Specifically, it is close to 35 percent, 30 percent, and nearly 25 percent, in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacefic respectively. Noticeable point is that North America's population is the sixth highest. In contrast, the distribution of wealth percentage reached a peak of nearly 35 percent.Secondly, China has the highest population. Specifically, it is close to a quarter, while the second and third countries have approximately 15 percent. In contrast, the distribution of wealth is not so larger than other countries. Although Europe's population is 15 percent and the distribution of wealth is 30 percent, the percentage of distribution of wealth in China is approximately three percent. This is only one-tenths, compared with Europe. Another noteworthy point is Latin America and Caribean. This is the only region the percentage of the population and global wealth is not significantly wide. It is more than six percentage of the population and around four percentage of global wealth.;The chart provides insights into the global population distribution and wealth allocation across eight distinct regions. It is evident that three regions - North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific - significantly outpace the others in terms of contributing to global wealth, with the remaining five regions each holding less than a 5% share.Initially, the chart highlights that North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific boast notably high percentages of global wealth. Specifically, North America holds close to 35%, Europe around 30%, and Asia-Pacific nearly 25%. Notably, North America, despite having the sixth-highest population, tops the chart with a wealth distribution percentage nearing 35%.Furthermore, China stands out with the highest population, comprising roughly a quarter of the global total. The next two most populous countries follow with approximately 15% each. However, China's wealth distribution is surprisingly not as substantial as other nations. In comparison, Europe, with a population of 15%, manages a 30% share of global wealth, whereas China's share is a mere 3%. This stark contrast reveals that Europe's wealth distribution is ten times that of China's. Another significant observation is the Latin America and Caribbean region, where the disparity between population percentage and global wealth share is not as pronounced, with over 6% of the population and around 4% of global wealth, indicating a relatively balanced distribution compared to other regions.
504;The chart below shows global sales of the top five mobile phone brands between 2009 and 2013.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar chart below indicates mobile phone market share for the best five different brands Samsung, Apple, Nokia, LG and ZTE between 2009 and 2013. The best two brands were Samsung and Nokia, more than 400 annually. The others were below less than 150 in the same period of time.In 2009, Nokia has reached almost 450 when the second best brand Samsung was lower than 250. The sales of Samsung soared to the top in 2013 when Nokia slipped down to 250 in the same year. The biggest drop of Nokia presented between 2011 and 2013 from over 400 to 250.The apple's market share was in the fifth position with no more than 50 in 2009. It has a similar trend like Samsung however in 2013 it has 150 sales. LG and ZTE were the relative small portion compared to Samsung and Nokia. The ZTE was improving slowly when LG was losing its market share every year.;The bar chart below illustrates the mobile phone market share of the top five brands - Samsung, Apple, Nokia, LG, and ZTE - from 2009 to 2013. The top two brands, Samsung and Nokia, consistently surpassed 400 units sold annually, while the other three brands remained below 150 units sold during the same period.In 2009, Nokia dominated the market with nearly 450 units sold, while Samsung trailed behind with less than 250 units. However, by 2013, Samsung's sales skyrocketed to the top, while Nokia's sales slipped to 250 units. The most significant decline for Nokia occurred between 2011 and 2013, when its sales plummeted from over 400 to 250 units.Apple's market share ranked fifth, with fewer than 50 units sold in 2009. Although it followed a similar trend to Samsung, Apple's sales reached 150 units by 2013. In contrast, LG and ZTE held relatively small market shares compared to Samsung and Nokia.

1128;The chart below shows numbers of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles travelled (PMT) by transportation type in 2002.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The chart illustrates numbers of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles travelled in 2002. It is divided into five transportation type: by commuter rail, by heavy rail, by light rail, by bus and by demand response.Overall, we notice the highest number of incident and injuries is due to transportation by demand response, while the use of commuter rail has the lowest number of these accidents. The number of injuries is lower than incident in all cases.In the case of commuter rail, the number of incidents which represents less than 30 incidents per 100 million PMT is almost equal to the number of injuries. The graph shows some similarities when we use light rail or bus, especially in regards of incidents. The numbers of incidents in both cases are about 75 incidents per 100 million PMT. However, the number of injuries increases from approximately 40 to 60 injuries per 100 million PMT. The transportation by demand response is responsible of more than 250 incidents and 150 injuries per 100 million PMT.;The chart provides a comparison of the number of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles traveled in 2002, categorized into five transportation modes: commuter rail, heavy rail, light rail, bus, and demand response. Upon examination, it becomes evident that demand response transportation accounts for the highest number of incidents and injuries, whereas commuter rail records the lowest. Across all modes, the incidence of injuries is consistently lower than that of incidents.Notably, commuter rail exhibits a unique trend where the number of incidents, which is less than 30 per 100 million passenger miles, is nearly equivalent to the number of injuries. A similar pattern emerges when comparing light rail and bus transportation, particularly in terms of incident rates, with both showing approximately 75 incidents per 100 million passenger miles. However, there is a noticeable increase in injuries from about 40 to 60 per 100 million passenger miles between these two modes. In stark contrast, demand response transportation is associated with significantly higher rates, exceeding 250 incidents and 150 injuries per 100 million passenger miles.
1072;The chart below shows the amount of leisure time enjoyed by men and women of different employment status.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The bar chart illustrates the information about how long male people and female people spent their time on leisure activities according to the sorts of job.Overall, it is clear that, the majority of those who retire their occupation or are not in employment, spent most of the time on leisure activities. Plus, male people were inclined to enjoy more time on chilling activities than females.Looking at the males in more detail, the figures for retired or unemployed male guys showed the highest range with over 80 hours in a week, meanwhile, other guys who obtained full-time job spent approximately 42 hours per week.With regard to women, most of them who finished their working life or were not yet to be employed had just under 80 hours for leisure time in every week, but there were just roughly 40 hours which was spent by women who were in charge hosewives, full-time job and part-time employment.;The bar chart provides information on the amount of time male and female individuals spend on leisure activities, categorized by occupation type. Overall, it is evident that the majority of individuals who are retired or unemployed spend the most time on leisure activities. Additionally, males tend to spend more time on leisure activities than females.A closer examination of the data for males reveals that retired or unemployed males have the highest leisure time, with over 80 hours per week. In contrast, males with full-time jobs spend approximately 42 hours per week on leisure activities.Regarding females, those who are retired or unemployed have nearly 80 hours of leisure time per week. However, females who are housewives, or have full-time or part-time jobs, spend significantly less time on leisure activities, with around 40 hours per week.

96;The chart below shows the expenditure on three categories among different age groups of residents in the UK in 2004.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the percentage of total allocation of expenses in three major categories among the citizens of the United Kingdom from five different age groups in the year 2004.Overall, the spending on food and drink continuously increased as the residents reached the older ages. Moreover, spending on entertainment activities also incresased but declined when reaching the later age, while going to a restaurant and hotel was its peak during early age and its lowest was upon reaching the retirement age.Food and drink are part of our daily necessisties, and as a family member grows in number, the more food and drink a family consumed. Over other categories, food and drink are more essential and priority of every residents as the total spending of it increased every fifteen years. This explains why the total expenditure of residents in the UK is mostly on food and drink. From age under 30 with almost 7% only, it sharply increased up to 23% in age 76 and above.In addition, expenses on entertainment reached its peak level of 23%, the same percentage with food and drink but in different age goup, in 61 to 75. In this stage, people already reached the retirement age wherein entertainment activities became a hobby while still having energy. But upon reaching 76 years and above, it declined to just 13%. However, expenditure in eating on a restaurant and staycation on a hotel were high with 14% under 30 years of age, while it dramatically decreased to below 3% upon reaching 61 to 75 years of age.;The bar chart depicts the distribution of expenses among UK citizens across five age groups in 2004, highlighting the allocation of spending in three primary categories. A notable trend is the consistent increase in expenditure on food and drink as individuals age. Conversely, spending on entertainment exhibits a growth pattern but declines at older ages. In contrast, dining out and hotel stays peak among younger age groups and plummet upon reaching retirement age.Food and drink are essential daily necessities, with consumption increasing as family sizes grow. Compared to other categories, they are prioritized, reflecting a steady rise in spending every 15 years. This explains why food and drink constitute the majority of UK residents' expenses. The data shows a sharp increase from 7% among those under 30 to 23% among those 76 and older.Entertainment expenses reach a peak of 23%, mirroring the food and drink expenditure but in a different age bracket, specifically the 61-75 group. At this stage, individuals are retired and likely pursue entertainment as a hobby while still having the energy. However, this spending declines to 13% upon reaching 76 and above. Meanwhile, expenses on dining out and hotel stays are significant among the under-30 group at 14% but drop dramatically to under 3% from 61-75 years of age.

426;The charts shows air pollution levels by different causes among four countries in 2021.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The bar chart illustrates the level of air pollution caused by three different sectors namely electricity generation, transport and industry among four countries which are China, America, Japan and Australia in 2021.Overall, it can be seen that China produced the highest amount of the pollution in every sector. Another noticeable point is that all causes in Australia created the pollution at almost the same amount.Looking at the detail, the industry, the transportation and the electricity generation in China generated the pollution level of 80, 70 and a little less than 60 ppm respectively. This pattern also occurred in Japan where the industry ranked first in releasing the pollution (above 40 ppm) and the power generation ranked last (produced around 15 ppm).Furthermore, approximately 60 ppm of the pollution in Australia is arisen from the electricity generation and the industry. This generated pollution of each aforementioned factors accounted for about 30 ppm which is nearly two times less than that of the transport. Focusing further on Australia, all three businesses created the pollution of just below 20 ppm.;The bar chart depicts the level of air pollution emitted by three sectors - electricity generation, transportation, and industry - in four countries: China, the United States, Japan, and Australia, for the year 2021.Overall, the chart reveals that China is the largest polluter in every sector. Another notable observation is that the pollution levels in Australia are relatively consistent across all three sectors.A closer examination of the data shows that in China, the pollution levels were approximately 80 ppm for industry, 70 ppm for transportation, and just under 60 ppm for electricity generation. A similar pattern is observed in Japan, where industry is the largest polluter (with over 40 ppm), followed by transportation and then electricity generation (which produced around 15 ppm).In Australia, the pollution levels from electricity generation and industry are each around 60 ppm. In contrast, the transportation sector in Australia emits around 30 ppm, which is roughly half the level of the other two sectors. Notably, all three sectors in Australia emit relatively low levels of pollution, at just under 20 ppm.

433;The dangers of smoking are well known, yet many people continue with this habit.What are the causes of this? How can we reduce smoking in society?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is very easy to find someone who smokes in today's society. Even though we were taught that smoke is harmful, we see people exhaling this thick fog everyday partly because some people think that it is cool and it can be purchased almost at every store. This essay will discuss deeply about what causes people to smoke and how this issue can be alleviated.Firstly, part of the society believes that it is trendy to smoke. In many pop culture, such as songs, movies, and novels portray smoking possitively. A comedy show that I have seen illustrates one of the character that smokes to be more cool, giving this character an untouchable aura, whilst other characters that did not smoke seem tangible and therefore mundane. Furthermore, cigarettes are easily accessable in any store. A recent study proved that over 80% of those eager to smoke for the first time actually started this behavior because they can buy it from their local shops. The trend from pop culture and the convenience in accessing smoke adds up to the reasons why some people continues with this habit.I believe that there are solutions that can tackle and reduce smoking, beginning with medias should portray smoking to have consequences that are relatable. A movie I have seen showed the protagonist's constant need for cigarette throughout the show. However, in the end when he finally unites with his crush, he develops a severe disease, mainly from his smoking habits, in which he regretted in the end. This method of portraying people who smoke totally made my younger niece scared of smoking. In addition, government should control the accessibility of cigarettes. Policies that result and fewer stores being able to sell cigarettes and increasing tax pricing of smoke of any kind will definitely make smoking less convenient for many people.In conclusion, although many people knew how harmful smoking is, many people think it is cool to smoke and it is convenient and easy to buy. By making smoking less trendy in society and harder to access, I believe that smoking will be less attractive, hence reducing the number of smokers in society.;Smoking is a pervasive habit in today's society, despite the well-known risks associated with it. The ease of access to cigarettes, combined with the glamorization of smoking in popular culture, has contributed to its widespread adoption. This essay will delve into the reasons behind smoking and explore potential solutions to mitigate this issue.One of the primary factors contributing to smoking is the perception that it is trendy and cool. Popular culture, including songs, movies, and novels, often portrays smoking in a positive light. For instance, a comedy show I watched featured a character who smoked, giving them an air of sophistication and invincibility, while non-smoking characters appeared ordinary and unremarkable. Furthermore, the widespread availability of cigarettes in stores has made it easy for people to start smoking. A recent study revealed that over 80% of first-time smokers were motivated to try cigarettes because they were readily available at local shops. The combination of pop culture's glorification of smoking and the convenience of accessing cigarettes has led many people to adopt this habit.However, I believe that there are effective ways to address and reduce smoking. One approach is for the media to depict the consequences of smoking in a realistic and relatable manner. A movie I watched, for example, showed the protagonist's constant craving for cigarettes, but ultimately, his smoking habit led to a severe disease, which he deeply regretted. This portrayal of smoking was so impactful that it scared my younger niece away from the idea of smoking. Additionally, governments should restrict access to cigarettes by implementing policies that limit the number of stores that can sell them and increasing taxes on tobacco products. By making smoking less convenient and less glamorous, I believe that its appeal will diminish, leading to a reduction in the number of smokers in society.In conclusion, despite the well-documented risks of smoking, many people still perceive it as cool and convenient. By making smoking less trendy and less accessible, I firmly believe that its allure will decrease, resulting in a decrease in the number of smokers in society.
496;The diagram below show the development of the horse over a period of 40 million years. The evolution of the horse, with particular emphasis on the changing foot structure.Write a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram illustrates the evolution of the horse in terms of their foot structure over a 40 million year period. Overall, the horse's were divided into four stages of development, starting from a period of 40 million years ago until now, with a 10 to 15 million year gap approximation in between.To begin with, 40 million years ago, the Eohippus, which was the first developmental stage of a horse's foot structure was similar to the bone structure of a human's hand. However, they branch out into five toes while travelling on foot. Then, during stage 2 of the horse's foot development, which was 10 million years later, the horse evolved into a Mesohippus. With regards to the structure of its toe, it was reduced from the original five into three. In addition, the middle toe had a larger foot structure compared to other other two.Next, 15 million years later, came the evolution of a Merychippus from a Mesohippus. Similarly, the foot structure was identical to the Mesohippus' horse but did not have the middle toe's length significantly longer than the other two. Although the middle toe was thicker than before, it became more even in terms of its length comparison to its other two toes. Finally, the emergence of the final evolution of the horse in modern days. With regards to the foot structure, it no longer branched out into several toes as it used to be, but is shaped like a tree branch with a rounded bases on the bottom of the foot.;The diagram depicts the evolution of the horse's foot structure over a period of 40 million years, divided into four distinct stages. The development stages are separated by approximately 10 to 15 million year gaps.The first stage, which occurred 40 million years ago, is represented by the Eohippus. At this stage, the horse's foot structure was similar to that of a human hand, with five toes that branched out as the horse moved. 10 million years later, during the second stage, the horse evolved into a Mesohippus. The toe structure was reduced from five to three, with the middle toe being significantly larger than the other two.The third stage occurred 15 million years later, with the emergence of the Merychippus from the Mesohippus. The foot structure of the Merychippus was similar to that of the Mesohippus, but with a notable difference: the middle toe was no longer significantly longer than the other two toes. Although it was thicker, its length was more even compared to the other two toes.Finally, the fourth and final stage of evolution is represented by the modern horse. In contrast to its predecessors, the horse's foot structure no longer branches out into multiple toes. Instead, it has a single, tree-branch-like shape with a rounded base on the bottom of the foot, marking the culmination of the horse's 40 million year evolutionary journey.

First of all, the olives are picked from the trees by the farmers. Then the fresh olives are rinished using the cold water. The machines used are specific and it helps belt to smash the olives. After smashed, the olives become either olive paster or the olive stones. The next step is to put those into a bag with holes. Moving onto the next step, it will be pressed by a certain pressurer. It gives a great amount of weight on the olives so that it can be well pressed. Moreover it will be separated into either oil or water. Then, it will be stored and sold to the consumers. Thus, it is quite apparent that olive oil is manufactured by specific steps. And so more, olive oil is widely used as it is a good source for the chefs when cooking.;Olive oil is produced through a multi-step process. First, farmers harvest olives from trees. Next, the fresh olives are washed with cold water. Specialized machines are used to crush the olives, which helps to release their contents. After crushing, the olives are separated into either olive paste or pits. The olive paste is then placed in a bag with holes, allowing for the next step in the process. The bag is subjected to a significant amount of pressure from a specialized press, which extracts the liquid from the olives. The resulting liquid is then separated into oil and water. Finally, the olive oil is stored and sold to consumers. It is clear that the production of olive oil involves a series of specific steps. Additionally, olive oil is widely used due to its numerous benefits, making it a valuable resource for chefs in the kitchen.

298;The diagram below shows how oil is expected in use of production of perfumeSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The given process chart illustrates how perfume is obtained using oil as an ingredient. Overall, the product undergoes 4 main steps, which involve prevalently water and the usage of heating and cooling down methods, in addition to a separation machine, before being ready to be used to create a fragrance.For starters, the water is placed in a metal tank and brought to the boiling point through direct flames. Then, the steam is conducted by a pipe to another cistern, where aromatic plants are added, in order to obtain oil vapor mixed with steam.Right afterward, the mixture goes into a pipe system, where a condensation process takes place, thanks to a condenser that uses cold water. In doing so, the cold water flowing in the condenser absorbs the heat that comes from the pipe where the oil and water solution is. After that, water mixed with essential oil reaches the last tank, in which a separator proceeds to take essential oil apart. This way, only the aromatic water is able to proceed and it is possible to use it in the perfume industry.;The process chart shows how perfume is produced using oil as a key ingredient. The production process involves four main stages, which primarily utilize water and employ heating and cooling methods, as well as a separation machine, to create a fragrance-ready product.Firstly, water is placed in a metal tank and heated to its boiling point using direct flames. The resulting steam is then directed through a pipe to another tank, where aromatic plants are added to produce a mixture of oil vapor and steam.Next, the mixture enters a piping system, where it undergoes condensation through a condenser that uses cold water. As the cold water flows through the condenser, it absorbs the heat from the pipe carrying the oil and water solution. After condensation, the water mixed with essential oil flows into a final tank, where a separator is used to isolate the essential oil. This process allows only the aromatic water to proceed, making it suitable for use in the perfume industry.

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;Information is presented in a diagram which depicts the main steps of rainwater treatment with the aim to produce drinking water in a particular town in Australia.Overall, it can be clearly seen that the process involves a number of complex stages starting from collecting rainwater, purification until getting the water as a final product.At the beginning of the process, rainwater is drained from a roof through a tube which is attached to each house. Then the water flow through the tube to a three-layer water filter which is the first step of water purification. After that, the filtered water is kept in a storage tank which is connected to a water treatment tank. As the water in the storage flows into the water treatment tank, it is mixed with chemicals, making this step as the final part of the process. Once the water is mixed, it flows from the water treatment tank to each house and is ready for drinking.;A diagram illustrates the key stages of rainwater treatment in a specific Australian town, with the goal of producing drinking water. The process encompasses multiple intricate steps, from collection to purification, ultimately yielding a final product. The treatment process begins with the collection of rainwater from rooftops, which is then channeled through a tube connected to each house. The collected rainwater flows through this tube into a three-layer water filter, marking the initial stage of purification. Following filtration, the water is stored in a tank linked to a water treatment facility. As the stored water flows into the treatment tank, it is blended with chemicals, constituting the final phase of the treatment process. Once the water has been treated, it flows from the treatment tank back to each household, ready for consumption.
472;The diagram below shows how solar panels can be used to provide electricity for domestic use.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram illustrates the production of electricity for domestic use by solar panels. Overall, electricity is provided after it has been processed using 5 equipments ( solar panels, inverter electrical panel, utility meter and utility grid).First of all, solar panels on the roof of a normal house receive and absorb energy from the sun and turn it into DC current. The second stage is that, the DC current is converted into AC current by using inverter, which controls the electricity and production. After that, once the solar electricity has been distributed to our homes, it is then flowed back to the grid through a utility meter.At the final stage of the process, a utility grid, which looks like a small electrical tower, provides electricity when an user uses extra amount than the amount produced by the solar panles. By these stages, electricity is produced and ready for domestic use.;The diagram depicts the process of generating electricity for domestic use through solar panels. The production of electricity involves five key components: solar panels, an inverter, an electrical panel, a utility meter, and a utility grid.The process begins with solar panels installed on the roof of a typical household, which capture and absorb sunlight, converting it into direct current (DC) electricity. The next stage involves the conversion of DC current into alternating current (AC) using an inverter, which regulates and controls the flow of electricity.Once the solar-generated electricity is distributed to homes, any excess energy is fed back into the grid through a utility meter. This meter measures the amount of electricity produced by the solar panels and the amount consumed by the household.In the final stage, the utility grid, resembling a small electrical tower, plays a crucial role in supplementing the solar power when the household's energy consumption exceeds the amount produced by the solar panels. Through these stages, electricity is generated and made available for domestic use, providing a reliable and efficient source of power.
1082;The diagram below shows the average hours of unpaid work per week done by people in different categories. (Unpaid work refers to such activities as childcare in the home, housework and gardening.)Describe the information presented below, comparing results for men and women in the categories shown. Suggest reasons for what you see.;"The bar graph provides information regarding the average hours of uncompensated work done weekly by men and women in marriage. The data are categorised by the number of children that they have.Overall, it is clearly observed that as the number of children increases, so is the average of unpaid working hours per week for married women. However, the time spent in these hours of their male counterparts are stable. It is also seen that the females have more hours of uncompensated labour than the males.In detail, those females with 3 or more children have worked 60 hours per week without pay, which is by far the highest average hour compared to the other categories. The amount of time they spent with this type of work diminishes as the number of children becomes fewer; married females with 1 to 2 children have 10 hours less and those without children have 30 hours weekly.In regard with the type of gender, married males have lesser average hours of unpaid jobs than married females. The maried men have only less than 20 hours per week spent on this job, which is apporoximately just a half of the time spent in women with children. Moreover, the time spent for married men did not alter in the different given categories.";The bar graph illustrates the average number of hours of unpaid work performed weekly by married men and women, categorized by the number of children they have. A clear trend emerges: as the number of children increases, the average number of unpaid working hours per week for married women also rises. In contrast, the time spent on unpaid work by their male counterparts remains relatively stable.Notably, married women consistently log more hours of uncompensated labor than married men. Specifically, women with three or more children dedicate an average of 60 hours per week to unpaid work, which is significantly higher than the other categories. As the number of children decreases, so does the amount of time spent on unpaid work: married women with one to two children work 10 hours less, and those without children work 30 hours less.In terms of gender, married men have substantially fewer average hours of unpaid work than married women. Married men spend less than 20 hours per week on unpaid work, which is roughly half the time spent by women with children. Furthermore, the amount of time spent on unpaid work by married men remains relatively constant across the different categories, showing no significant variation.

Tool A is a tool of 1.4 million years ago, whereas, Tool B is a cutting tool of 0.8 million years ago.Overall, Toll A and B were bigger than 5 cm long, were made of stone and were used in the Stone Age as cutting tools. Tool A had a triangular form, whilst, Tool B had a more complex form which is similar to a pentagon.In detail, the front view of Tool A seems rougher and with less sharpness than Tool B. Regarding the side view, the diagram shows that Tool A was wider than Tool B. Finally, the back view of Tool A shows that this device was thinner than Tool B's back view.To sum it up, these two cutting tools were similar in material and length. However, Tool B seems that it was a more developed tool, which was thinner in the side view and with a more complex form in its front and back view than Tool A.;The diagram illustrates the evolution of two Stone Age cutting tools, Tool A and Tool B, from three different perspectives: front, side, and back views. Tool A dates back to 1.4 million years ago, while Tool B is a more recent development, originating from 0.8 million years ago.In general, both tools share certain characteristics: they exceed 5 cm in length, are made of stone, and were utilized as cutting instruments during the Stone Age. However, they differ in shape, with Tool A exhibiting a triangular form and Tool B having a more intricate, pentagon-like shape.Upon closer inspection, the front view of Tool A appears coarser and less sharp than that of Tool B. From the side, the diagram reveals that Tool A is wider than Tool B. Additionally, the back view of Tool A shows it to be thinner than the back view of Tool B.In summary, while both tools are similar in terms of material and length, Tool B appears to be a more advanced tool. It is characterized by its thinner side profile and more complex shape, evident in both its front and back views, distinguishing it from Tool A. This suggests a progression in tool development, with Tool B representing a more refined and sophisticated cutting instrument.

It is clear that the village growth is particularly linked with the building of the motorway and the railway. The increased infrastructure shaped the layout of surrounded area.The village was situated on the main road and was comparatively small rom 1868 until 1883. However, from 1883 onwards, the village grew significantly on the southern side. This was due to the railway contstruction in 1909. The part around the Chorleyood Station got populated and stretched along the railroad until the 1970s.Another key factor of the development was the construction of the motorway in 1970. The motorway was build on the eastern side of the city and crossed the main road as well as the railway. This resulted in new developments around the newly built motorway on former unspoiled land, espescially the Chorleywood Park and Golf Course.;The provided map depicts the transformations undergone by Chorleywood, a village situated near London, which has experienced significant population growth since 1850. Between 1868 and 1994, the village's structure underwent substantial changes. The expansion of Chorleywood is closely tied to the development of the motorway and the railway, with enhanced infrastructure playing a pivotal role in shaping the surrounding area's layout.Initially, from 1868 to 1883, the village was small and located along the main road. However, from 1883 onwards, it witnessed considerable growth on its southern side, largely attributed to the railway construction that commenced in 1909. The area around Chorleywood Station became populated and expanded along the railway line up until the 1970s.The construction of the motorway in 1970 marked another crucial factor in the village's development. Built on the eastern side of the village, the motorway intersected both the main road and the railway, leading to new developments on previously undeveloped land, notably the Chorleywood Park and Golf Course, which emerged around the newly constructed motorway.
1038;The diagram below shows the life cycle of a salmon, from egg to adult fish.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram depicts the life-cycle of the salmon, from being an egg to transforming into a fully grown adult fish.The first stage of the salmon starts in the river, where the spawning of two mature salmons lead to the laying of eggs. The rivers have long been chosen by salmons for breeding spots because their fresh-saltless water is suitable for the eggs and the freshly hatched baby salmons to start maturing in. After emerging from the eggs, the hatchlings stay on in the fresh water till they pre-mature/partially grow. After gaining considerable size and adapting to the primary waters, they travel to the estuaries, the only stop-over between them and the oceans. Only the first of the young salmons to reach the estuaries are able to make it to the oceans. This is because once these small and stagnant water bodies get over-crowded, there is virtually no space left in them which in-turn leads to the death of many young salmons.The young salmons who were able to survive the estuaries journey to the oceans, where the salty water increases their size and makes them fully grown. After getting the maturity to breed, they go back to the rivers from where the cycle starts all-over again.In total, there are 8 stages in the life of a salmon to maturity, it starts in the rivers and ends in the rivers too.;The diagram illustrates the life cycle of a salmon, from its initial stage as an egg to its development into a fully grown adult fish. The life cycle of a salmon begins in a river, where two mature salmon spawn, resulting in the laying of eggs. Rivers have been chosen by salmon as breeding grounds due to their freshwater, which is ideal for the eggs and newly hatched salmon to mature. After hatching, the young salmon, known as hatchlings, remain in the freshwater until they partially grow. Once they have gained significant size and adapted to the freshwater, they migrate to the estuaries, a transitional zone between the river and the ocean. However, only the first batch of young salmon to reach the estuaries can successfully make it to the ocean, as the estuaries can become overcrowded, leading to the death of many young salmon.The young salmon that survive the estuaries journey then migrate to the ocean, where the salty water facilitates their growth into fully grown adults. Upon reaching maturity, they return to the river where their life cycle initially began, marking the start of a new cycle. In total, a salmon's life cycle consists of 8 stages, from its birth in the river to its return to the river as a mature adult, ready to begin the cycle anew.
458;The diagram below shows the life cycle of the honey bee.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;Overall the cycle of life of the honey bee can be divided in 6 steps which can be grouped in 2 main stages: hatching and reaching for maturity. This process lasts around 34 to 36 days and it repeats itself over again.The cycle starts when female bees lay their eggs. They lay their eggs rapidly but surely at around 1 or 2 eggs every 3 days. Subsequently the hatching of the eggs happens after 9 to 10 days.Afterwards the nymph molts begin to come out of the eggs and keep on gradually growing up until the 7th day of the cycle. During their 9th day, the bees grow 3 times their initial size. Following this, the young adult emerges. The final step occurs after 4 days when the bee reaches its maturity and females are ready to lay eggs again. Making the cycle begin again from the laying of the eggs.;The life cycle of a honey bee can be broken down into six stages, which are categorized into two main phases: hatching and maturation. This entire process typically lasts between 34 to 36 days and is a recurring cycle.The cycle commences with female bees laying eggs at a rate of approximately 1 or 2 eggs every 3 days. After 9 to 10 days, these eggs hatch, marking the beginning of the next stage.Following hatching, the nymphs emerge from the eggs and undergo gradual growth until around the 7th day of the cycle. By the 9th day, these young bees have grown to three times their initial size. Shortly after, they emerge as young adults.The final stage of the cycle occurs 4 days later, when the bee reaches full maturity. At this point, female bees are ready to lay eggs, thus initiating the cycle anew, starting with the laying of eggs. This repetitive process ensures the continuous development and growth of the honey bee colony.
336;The diagram below shows the production of olive oil. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;This illust displays all the procedures by which olive oil is produced from olives. There is a total of seven steps where the initial step is to pick some olives, and the final step is to extract only olive oil from pressed olive paste.To put into detail, obtaining enough amounts of olive is the starting process. Picked olives are rinsed in cold water. After that, rinsed olives are delivered into a smashing machine through belts. This machine enables olives to divide into olive paste and olive stones. Thereafter, only olive paste is put into hollow bags and carried into the pressing process. Olive paste inside the bag is pressed and further move into separating process. A portion of olive oil is completely removed from the rest of water portion. Finally, extracted olive oil is delivered to storages and on the market if necessarily. This is the complete process of olive oil production.;This illustration outlines the entire process of producing olive oil from olives, involving a total of seven steps. The process begins with the harvesting of olives and concludes with the extraction of pure olive oil from pressed olive paste.In more detail, the initial step involves collecting a sufficient quantity of olives. Once gathered, the olives are washed in cold water to remove any dirt or debris. Next, they are transported via conveyor belts to a crushing machine, which breaks down the olives into a paste and separates the stones. The resulting olive paste is then placed into perforated bags, which are taken to the pressing stage. During this stage, the olive paste is subjected to pressure, which helps to release the oil, and this mixture then moves on to the separation stage. Here, a portion of the oil is fully separated from the water content, resulting in pure olive oil. Finally, the extracted olive oil is stored and, if necessary, distributed to the market. This comprehensive process encompasses the production of olive oil from start to finish.
574;The diagram below shows the proposed town.

606;The diagram below shows the structure of solar panels and its use.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagrams illustrate the construction of a simple solar panel and how it works to heat air or water while passing through the inner chamber of the equipment. Although more complex and modern solar panels are available in today’s world, a solar panel simply consists of three main parts, a box-shaped basement, transparent glass, the entry, the exit of the inner tube. Naturally, sunray as an energy source is essential to use the heating system.Considering the function of solar panel, transparent glass which is in optimal thickness act as a receiver of heat from the sun, that eventually transfer to air or water. A similar principle works for both substances. While the substance to be heated moves through the cylinder, heat energy is convected that provides heated material which can be used for different purposes such as household or commercial needs. Finally, a heated substance is pumped into pipes which are mounted to the outlet of the panel.;The diagrams depict the design and functionality of a basic solar panel, demonstrating how it heats air or water as they pass through the internal chamber. While modern solar panels are more complex, a fundamental solar panel comprises three primary components: a box-shaped base, transparent glass, and inlet and outlet tubes. The sun's rays serve as the essential energy source for operating the heating system.In terms of its function, the transparent glass, with its optimal thickness, acts as a heat receiver from the sun, which is then transferred to either air or water. This principle applies equally to both substances. As the substance to be heated flows through the inner cylinder, convection occurs, providing heated material that can be utilized for various purposes, including household and commercial applications. Ultimately, the heated substance is pumped into pipes attached to the panel's outlet, completing the heating process.

126;The diagram shows the components of a neuron and how it worksWrite a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram below identifies the role of each neuronal components and illustrates the message transmission process happening in a neuron.The main component of a neuron is the cell body or soma. From its core branches out many small nerves called dendrites with the role of receving messages from other cells. The acquired messages are passed away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles or glands through a chain of axon. Each axon is coverred by a small element called myelin sheath that helps speed up the neural impulses.The message transmission process is conducted by continous actions of each component. After the dendrites receive information, the cell body will trigger an electrical signal traveling down the axon chain carrying these messages to a destination consisting of a network off terminal buttons. Each button form junction with other dendrite other cells to connect the messages. After all, all neuron are connected to form a network.;The following diagram highlights the function of each neuronal component and demonstrates the process of message transmission within a neuron.The cell body, also known as the soma, is the primary component of a neuron. Extending from the cell body are numerous small nerve fibers called dendrites, which are responsible for receiving messages from other cells. These received messages are then transmitted away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles, or glands via a chain of axons. Each axon is coated with a thin layer called the myelin sheath, which facilitates the rapid transmission of neural impulses.The message transmission process is facilitated by the continuous actions of each component. Once the dendrites receive information, the cell body initiates an electrical signal that travels down the axon chain, conveying the messages to a destination comprising a network of terminal buttons. Each button forms a junction with the dendrites of other cells, enabling the connection of messages. Ultimately, all neurons are interconnected to form a complex network.

After that, we let them dry in a sufficient temperature outside so that we can spin them.After we finish the spinning process, we break them into two productions which are wool and string. The string production can be recycled while the wool can be made into tufts of wool and put them in the tuft of storage.The balls of yarn comes from the tuft storage which later are the things that we are knitting. The balls of yarn are also the main source to make woolen goods such carpets and jackets which are usually we use in a daily life.;The diagram below illustrates the process of producing woolen goods, which can be divided into two main stages. The first stage involves producing the raw wool, while the second stage involves manufacturing the yarn.To begin, sheep are sheared to obtain the wool, which is then cleaned and dried outdoors at a suitable temperature. Once dry, the wool is ready to be spun into yarn. After spinning, the production is split into two separate products: wool and string. The string can be recycled, while the wool is formed into tufts and stored.The tuft storage is the source of the balls of yarn, which are then used for knitting. These balls of yarn are also the primary material for creating various woolen goods, such as carpets and jackets, that are commonly used in everyday life.

844;The diagram shows the production of circuit boards.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The flow chart sheds light on how circuit boards are produced.Overall, the chart presents a multi-phase process that starts with the delivery of raw materials and ends with final products being delivered to factories.When the raw materials are delivered to circuit-board producers, they will be cut and sprayed with fire retardant, and experience the cleaning process. Subsequently, the product will undergo the automatic IC attachment and soldering. Following the IC attachment and soldering, there will be two stages of quality oversight, including visual inspection and quality control testing and final testing. If each of the inspection stages identifies any substandard products, the chips from such rejected products will be discarded. On the contrary, the products that pass the inspection process will be packaged and then sent to relevant users.To draw a conclusion, the production of circuit boards consists of a few stages, such as cutting and spraying, IC attachment and soldering, quality supervision, etc.;The flow chart provides insight into the production process of circuit boards. It outlines a multi-step process that begins with the delivery of raw materials to circuit board manufacturers and culminates in the delivery of finished products to factories. Upon arrival, the raw materials undergo cutting and are treated with a fire retardant, followed by a cleaning process. Next, the boards are subject to automated IC (Integrated Circuit) attachment and soldering. After these steps, the products go through two phases of quality assessment: a visual inspection and a quality control test, which includes a final test. Any products that fail to meet standards during these inspections will have their defective components removed and discarded. In contrast, products that successfully pass the quality checks are packaged and shipped to their intended users.In summary, circuit board production involves several key stages, including material preparation (cutting and spraying), IC attachment and soldering, quality supervision, and final testing, highlighting the complexity and meticulous nature of the manufacturing process.
794;The diagram shows the production of hydroelectricitySummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The diagram displays the general principles of how electricity is generated in a dam. In general, to produce hydroenergy, there should be a difference in the level of water flowing through the turbine.The water is stored in the reservoir out of which it goes through the intake to the penstrock. The pens should be inclined. This means that its high point is in the intake and then it goes down to the turbine. The pressure, that the flow creates, makes the turbin roll and start the generator. Generator produces power that is supplied to the long distance power lines.Having passed throuth the turbine, water, in its turn, sharply goes down and falls into the river.As it can be seen from the diagram, the generator and long distance power lines are located on the ground while there parts of the dam, such as the intake, the penstock, and the turbine are all under the ground.;The diagram illustrates the fundamental principles of hydroelectricity generation in a dam. To produce hydroenergy, a significant difference in water level is required to flow through the turbine. The process begins with water stored in a reservoir, which then flows through an intake and into a penstock. The penstock is angled, with its highest point at the intake, sloping downward to the turbine. As the water flows, it creates pressure that causes the turbine to rotate, activating the generator. The generator produces electricity, which is then transmitted to long-distance power lines.After passing through the turbine, the water rapidly descends and empties into the river. Notably, the diagram shows that the generator and long-distance power lines are situated on the ground, while components of the dam, including the intake, penstock, and turbine, are submerged underground.

One of the subbraches is West indies, that divides into Jamaican and Barbados. Similarly, Far east and Australian subbranches also divides into two subbranches (Malay and chinese, and Australian and Newzealand respectively). West african, Angelophones and East African are three languages that belong to the African Subbranch. Last two subbranches - Indian pakistan and British Isles each divide into four types of languages, British Isles into Irish, English, Welsh and Scotish, and Indian Pakistan into four different forms of indian english.;This diagram depicts the relationships between various types of English languages, highlighting the connections between American English and British English, as well as their respective subbranches.At the highest level, the English language is divided into two primary branches: American English and British English. British English, in particular, has a more complex structure with a greater number of subbranches compared to American English.American English is subdivided into two main subbranches: the United States and Canada. The Canadian subbranch is further divided into two distinct types: Anglophone Canadian and Francophone Canadian. In contrast, the United States subbranch is more diverse, branching out into six distinct types, including those spoken in the Philippines, American Samoa, the West Coast, the Midwest, the Northeast Coast, and Puerto Rico.British English, on the other hand, exhibits a more extensive branching pattern, with three times as many subbranches as American English. One of its subbranches is the West Indies, which splits into Jamaican and Barbadian. Similarly, the Far East and Australian subbranches each divide into two subcategories: Malay and Chinese for the Far East, and Australian and New Zealand for the Australian subbranch. The African subbranch comprises West African, Anglophone, and East African languages. The last two subbranches, Indian Pakistan and British Isles, each subdivide into four distinct languages. The British Isles branch separates into Irish, English, Welsh, and Scottish, while the Indian Pakistan branch diversifies into four unique forms of Indian English.
192;The diagrams below show how houses can be protected in areas which are prone to flooding.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The schemes compare two different methods of defence for homes that can be easily affected by floods. Overall, they show flood protection with and without a stopbank, while the at-risk home is raised higher above ground level in two pictures.The first diagram depicts how a stopbank acts as a natural barrier to prevent river water from flooding. The stopbank is a small mound of land next to the river that is higher than the 100-year-flood level and prevents the drain from overwhelming its banks. Nearby buildings can be built on stilts to prevent flooding from rainwater as well as the water passing through the floodgate beneath the stopbank, resulting in an area of ‘internal ponding.’If it had not been a stopbank, as described in the second diagram, there would have been nothing to stop the river from flooding. In this case, the solution is to put homes on stilts much higher than the one in the first picture. The height of the stilts is measured to ensure that the floor of the house is three hundred meters above the 100-year-flood level regardless of how deep the water area is under the house. This measure is called the ‘freeboard.’;"The schemes illustrate two distinct approaches to defending homes that are prone to flooding. They demonstrate flood protection with and without a stopbank, while also showing a home elevated higher above ground level in two separate scenarios.The first illustration explains how a stopbank functions as a natural barrier to prevent flooding from river water. The stopbank is a raised mound of land adjacent to the river, designed to be higher than the 100-year-flood level, thereby preventing the river from overflowing its banks. Nearby homes can be built on stilts to protect against flooding from both rainwater and the water flowing under the stopbank through a floodgate, which can create an area of ""internal ponding"" around the home.In contrast, the second diagram depicts a scenario without a stopbank, where the river would be able to flood freely. To mitigate this, homes are built on stilts that are significantly higher than those in the first scenario. The height of these stilts is carefully calculated to ensure that the floor of the house is at least 300 meters above the 100-year-flood level, regardless of the water depth beneath the house. This safety margin is referred to as the ""freeboard""."
966;The diagrams below show the design for a wave-energy machine and its location.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;first of all, the picture show (A Wave- energy machine) we can see that there is electricity generator its the machine that take the energy from the waves and it contain two turbines so the air could flow throuh it and from what it shown we can notice that there is two of wave energy machin: the large waves and the small waves.Secondly,the small wavs had low output since its for the small waves, in addition it also had low installation costs because its smaller.in the other hand the large waves had high output and high installation costs since its also large.To sum up we can say that the air flow to the turbine so the turbine could move and got the electrisity , there is also air come from the water levels which hepls the machine get the elecricity that it needs so the people could use it like a solar power.;Initially, the image depicts a wave-energy machine, which is equipped with an electricity generator. This machine harnesses energy from waves and features two turbines, allowing air to flow through them. Upon closer inspection, it appears that there are two types of wave energy machines: one designed for large waves and another for small waves.Furthermore, the smaller wave machine has a lower output, as it is intended for smaller waves. Additionally, it has lower installation costs due to its smaller size. In contrast, the larger wave machine has a higher output, but also comes with higher installation costs due to its larger size.In summary, the air flows through the turbine, causing it to move and generate electricity. Moreover, air from the water levels also contributes to the machine's electricity production, enabling people to utilize it as a viable alternative energy source, similar to solar power.
916;The diagrams below show the development of the horse over a period of 40 million years.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant;The diagram depicts the different stages of the body habitus and the relative changes in foot structures that under went in the process of evolution of the modern horse, since 40 million years ago.The modern horse had gone through 3 main stages in order to become it's current version, each stage shows distinctive changes in the body as a whole.Having said that, the earliest species that existed is namely Echippus, then it was mesohippus and finally it was Merychippus.The Echippus is the identified first ancestor of the modern horse that existed 40 million years ago. They appeared relatively similar to the size of a sheep and their foot apearently had four toes.However, Mesohippus was the second in line of the modern horses and was relatively bigger and taller, the foot structure got limited to three toes and the middle toe being the widerest.15 million years after the existance of mesohippus, merychippus emerged, they were similar in both the size and shape of our modern horses, but as far as the foot is concerned the middle toe became more prominent and the rest two toes started to shrink. Finally, the modern horses look twice the size of Echippus and their feet looked proper coronet.;The diagram illustrates the various stages of body habitus and the corresponding changes in foot structure that occurred during the 40 million year evolution of the modern horse. This process involved three main stages, each characterized by distinct transformations in the body as a whole. The ancestral lineage of the modern horse is comprised of three notable species: Echippus, Mesohippus, and Merychippus.Echippus, the earliest identified ancestor of the modern horse, existed approximately 40 million years ago. It was relatively small, similar in size to a sheep, and had a foot structure with four toes. In contrast, Mesohippus, which emerged later, was larger and taller, with a foot structure that had reduced to three toes, and a wider middle toe.Merychippus, which appeared 15 million years after Mesohippus, was similar in size and shape to modern horses. However, its foot structure showed significant changes, with the middle toe becoming more prominent and the other two toes starting to shrink. Ultimately, the modern horse evolved to be roughly twice the size of Echippus, with a foot structure that resembled a proper coronet, marking the culmination of this evolutionary process.
528;The diagrams below show the existing ground floor plan of a house and a proposed plan for some building work.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The information below shows the present floor plan and changes been suggested. Generally spekaing, there is no big difference, kitchen will stay as a kitchen and living room will stay as a living room.At the moment the living room space is smaller than in proposed new plan. The living room space suggested to be increased as internal wall will be demolited. Moreover, in suggested plan there is no place for storage under the stairs as stairs will be changed in their shape and also there will be no more hall place will be integrated into living room.The door intro kitchen will be switched from single one to double and will be located near the entrance door. The kitchen furniture suggested to be located on the opposite side to the wall and doubled indoor door. However, some things stays the same in both plans. For example, the location of both entrance doors - front and backyard and also wall between hall and kitchen.;The current floor plan and proposed changes are outlined below. Overall, the layout remains largely unchanged, with the kitchen and living room retaining their original functions.However, there are some notable differences. The living room is currently smaller than in the proposed new plan, which suggests increasing its size by demolishing an internal wall. Additionally, the new plan eliminates the storage space under the stairs, as the staircase will be reconfigured and the hallway will be incorporated into the living room.The kitchen will also undergo some changes. The single door will be replaced with a double door, which will be relocated near the entrance. The kitchen furniture will be positioned on the opposite side of the wall, adjacent to the doubled indoor door. Nevertheless, some aspects of the original plan will remain intact, including the locations of the front and backyard entrance doors, as well as the wall separating the hall and kitchen.
784;The diagrams below show the water supply system in Australia present and in future.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The given diagram illustrates the processes involved in the water supply system in Australia at the present and in the future.To begin, the first kind of water is located in the dam and storage where the waste water is lead to a water treatment plant. Meanwhile, from the storage come out pure water and provide potable water to households, factories, shops, and all the city. At the same time, the wastewater produced in the city is transferred to a water treatment plant as well.The last type of water is the storm water that is sent to the river from the city.Overall, it can be seen that the process has three types of waters in the process of water supply which are pure, storm, and waste water. depending on the type of water, these can be found in the dam and storage, water treatment plant, river and in different places of the city such as households, factories, shops, among others.;The provided diagram depicts the current and future processes involved in Australia's water supply system. The process begins with water stored in dams and reservoirs, from which wastewater is directed to a water treatment plant. Simultaneously, treated water from the storage facilities is distributed as potable water to various sectors of the city, including households, factories, and shops. Additionally, wastewater generated within the city is also channeled to a water treatment plant for processing.Lastly, stormwater from the city is diverted to rivers. In summary, the water supply process encompasses three primary types of water: pure water, stormwater, and wastewater. These types of water can be found in various locations, including dams, storage facilities, water treatment plants, rivers, and different parts of the city such as homes, industrial areas, and commercial establishments.
136;The diagrams show the structure of solar panel and its use.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The diagram illustrates how a solar panel is constructed, and the complex process of how the renewable energy source provides heated water and air to households.The first diagram shows us visual information about the basic structure of the solar panel. It´s construction is mainly a large box with two pipes placed on both sides. Then, one equally large top which is transparent is placed on top of the container.According to the second diagram, the solar panel is designed to provide the home with warm air. Firstly, cold air is allowed in through the inlet and let inside the box. Secondly, the transparent top allows sunrays to transform the cool air to warm air by their heating properties. After that, the warm air goes through and out the outlet.In regards to the third diagram, we can clearly see that the construction is similar with the exception that water pipes are added in the main box, in order to supply households with hot water. In comparison with the second diagram, where air was driven through the pipes, water is the main resource here. After the water has entered the inlet, water passes through the pipes and out;The diagram provides a detailed illustration of the construction of a solar panel and the intricate process by which it supplies heated water and air to homes, serving as a renewable energy source.The initial diagram offers a visual representation of the solar panel's basic structure. Essentially, it consists of a large container with two pipes, one on each side, and a similarly sized transparent top that is placed over the container.As shown in the second diagram, the solar panel is engineered to warm the air within a home. The process begins with cold air entering through an inlet into the box. The transparent top of the panel then allows sunlight to warm the air through its heating properties. Once warmed, the air exits through an outlet.The third diagram reveals a similar construction, with the notable addition of water pipes within the main box, designed to provide households with hot water. In contrast to the second diagram, where air was the primary medium, water is the main resource here. The process involves water entering through an inlet, passing through the pipes where it is heated, and then exiting, thereby supplying hot water to homes.

1291;The end of the world’s fossil fuel resources and the subsequent changes will be a positive development in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"Today’s society overwhelmingly depends on products made from fossil fuels. Most people would initially think about fuel for transport, but of course, fossil fuels are part of most of the fabric of life around us, from the plastics on our furniture to the pavements that we walk on. Changing our reliance on these resources can have various consequences; however, I believe that overall the society will benefit from finding viable alternatives for them.Depending on whether eco-friendly alternatives are developed, the positive effect on transport and the reduction of the associated pollution will be significant. Exhaust fumes from motor vehicles, planes and ships decrease air quality and contribute to global warming and the greenhouse effect. People’s health and the health of the planet will surely improve without these industries relying on fossil fuels. It could be that a type of transport crisis could develop as a result if society can no longer provide the power to transport so many individuals to where they want to go. This, however, does not have to be a bad thing, as it could force society to use alternative solutions, such as transport sharing and public transport development. The change in mind set has already begun. Some countries have already committed to having fossil fuel free transport and more cities are banning private vehicles from the centre of cities.Another positive development would be that more time and money would have to be put into developing renewable sources of energy, such as wind power, solar power, hydropower and tidal power. Technologies would improve and be more efficient and again, the world would use fewer sources of energy that cause pollution. This development can also be seen today, with many governments committing to proportions of their power needs coming from renewable resources.I, therefore, strongly agree with the statement that the changes from reducing reliance on fossil fuels will be positive. The only caveat is that society will need to have developed alternative sources of power rather soon, in order to avoid an energy crisis.";Our modern society is heavily reliant on products derived from fossil fuels, which are deeply ingrained in our daily lives, from the plastics in our furniture to the roads we walk on. Shifting away from this dependence can have far-reaching consequences, but I firmly believe that finding alternative solutions will ultimately benefit society as a whole. The development of eco-friendly alternatives will significantly reduce pollution from transportation, such as exhaust fumes from cars, planes, and ships, which currently degrade air quality and contribute to global warming. This, in turn, will lead to improved public health and a healthier planet. However, a potential transport crisis may arise if fossil fuels are no longer available to power the large-scale transportation of people. On the other hand, this could prompt society to adopt alternative solutions like car-sharing and enhanced public transportation systems. In fact, this shift in mindset has already begun, with some countries pledging to achieve fossil fuel-free transportation and cities banning private vehicles from their centers.Another advantage of reducing our reliance on fossil fuels is the increased investment in renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, hydro, and tidal power. As technology advances and becomes more efficient, the world will move away from polluting energy sources. This trend is already visible, with many governments committing to generate a significant portion of their energy needs from renewable resources.In conclusion, I strongly support the idea that decreasing our dependence on fossil fuels will have a positive impact. The only condition is that society must develop alternative energy sources relatively quickly to avoid an energy crisis. Overall, I believe that the benefits of transitioning away from fossil fuels far outweigh the potential drawbacks, and I am optimistic about the positive changes that this shift will bring about.
1307;The fact that enormous sums are paid for pieces of art is not acceptable at a time when many people around the world live in poverty. Discuss this statement and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is true that pieces of art in today’s world can change hands for enormous sums. Works by artists such as Picasso, da Vinci and Rembrandt have been sold for millions of dollars. Recently, a Modigliani was sold to a billionaire for one hundred and seventy million dollars. It certainly seems obscene that such figures are spent when many people around the world live in poverty.The work of many charities would be transformed by the money generated by just one of these art sales and in turn, the lives of ordinary people in need would be transformed. Medicines, food and shelter amongst other things could easily be provided, saving lots of lives, many of which would be children. When the issue is looked at from this point of view, the art sales world certainly seems obscene.However, in my opinion, things are unlikely to change. Human greed is endemic and people who have the drive to earn that amount of money and who actually have access to these sums in cash are not often people who will part with their wealth. Lots of prosperous people support many charities, but it is unlikely that they would completely relinquish their access to the luxuries that accompany their lives. The works of art are also often seen as investments in themselves, to be held on to for a period of time and then resold at a profit.In conclusion, in an ideal world, the vast sums of money that are spent on fine and rare works of art would be better spent on helping those in need. In reality, however, this is unlikely to take place.;The art market has become a multi-million dollar industry, with pieces by renowned artists like Picasso, da Vinci, and Rembrandt being sold for staggering sums. A recent example is the sale of a Modigliani to a billionaire for a whopping $170 million. This raises questions about the morality of spending such enormous amounts on art when millions of people worldwide live in poverty. The proceeds from just one of these sales could drastically impact the work of charities and, in turn, transform the lives of those in need, providing essential necessities like medicine, food, and shelter, and saving countless lives, including those of children. From this perspective, the art sales world appears excessively extravagant. However, I believe that change is unlikely. Human greed is pervasive, and individuals who have amassed enormous wealth and have the means to acquire these expensive artworks are often reluctant to part with their riches. While many affluent individuals do support charitable causes, few are willing to sacrifice the luxuries that come with their wealth. Additionally, these artworks are frequently viewed as investments, meant to be held onto for a period before being resold for a profit.In an ideal world, the vast sums spent on rare and fine artworks would be better allocated towards aiding those in need. Unfortunately, reality suggests that this is unlikely to happen. The allure of wealth and the investment potential of art will likely continue to drive the market, leaving the disparity between excessive spending on art and the needs of the impoverished unchanged.

However, Tasks like pet care and house repairs male were higher in percentage then female.Secondly, Ladies performed the mentioned tasks more than men in regards of cooking they spent about 1 hour and 20 min and in cleaning approximately 68 minutes. However, they were equal in pet care, Although men spend close to 20 min minutes in house repair on average basis.;The two provided charts depict the household work done by males and females in a nation, with two key aspects being measured: firstly, the amount of work done by men and women is expressed as a percentage, and secondly, the average time spent performing these tasks is calculated in minutes.Overall, it is evident that women undertake more household tasks than men in both aspects. However, there is an exception where men perform more house repairs than women.Upon closer examination, it becomes clear that women perform more household work than men. Their primary responsibilities lie in cooking and cleaning, with 80% of women engaging in cooking and 60% in cleaning. In contrast, men's participation in these tasks is 20% lower. Conversely, tasks such as pet care and house repairs show higher male participation rates compared to female.Regarding the time spent on these tasks, women dedicate more time than men. For cooking, they spend approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes, and for cleaning, around 68 minutes. Interestingly, both genders allocate equal time to pet care. Meanwhile, men spend an average of close to 20 minutes on house repairs.

714;The flow chart illustrates the consequence of deforestation. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features.You should write at least 150 words.;"The supplied illustration outlines the problems of cutting forests. As we can see, there are 4 main branches and each of them describes a certain issue, caused by deforestation.According to the first branch from the left, forest destruction can lead to the state when soil becomes hard and ""baked"". It occurs due to the fact that heavy logging equipment compresses the soil, as the first block of the chart says. Because soil becomes ""baked"", rain water starts to run off which causes flooding.If we look at the remaining branches, we can see that they all lead to the same conclusion - less biodiversity. But there are three different reasons for it. The first one is soil erosion. When we cut the trees, we have fewer tree roots to support the topsoil that eventually erodes.The second reason - increased risk of burning. It is followed by the destruction of waste wood. Then we have some micro-organisms such as pioneer species that move in and initiate degradation of vegetation. And it's all resulted in less biodiversity.The last branch starts with the fact that after cutting forests we have less plants to give back moisture to air, so less moisture enters the air. This triggers less precipitation, and so, increased droughts. Plants that unable to withstand hot and dry weather die and it ends with less biodiversity.To conclude everything, the main purpose of the presented flow chart was to demonstrate the severe damage that could be caused by deforestation.";"The provided illustration highlights the consequences of deforestation, which can be categorized into four main issues. Each branch of the illustration describes a distinct problem caused by forest cutting.The first branch, located on the left, illustrates how forest destruction can lead to soil compaction, causing it to become hard and ""baked."" This occurs due to the compression of soil by heavy logging equipment, as indicated in the first block of the chart. As a result, rainwater runs off, leading to flooding.Examining the remaining branches reveals that they all converge to the same outcome: reduced biodiversity. However, there are three different underlying reasons for this consequence. The first reason is soil erosion, which happens when tree roots are no longer present to support the topsoil, leading to its erosion after trees are cut down.The second reason is the increased risk of forest fires, which is followed by the destruction of leftover wood debris. This creates an environment where micro-organisms, such as pioneer species, can thrive and initiate the degradation of vegetation, ultimately resulting in reduced biodiversity.The last branch explains that after forests are cut down, there are fewer plants to release moisture into the air, leading to reduced precipitation and increased droughts. Plants that are unable to withstand the hot and dry conditions die off, culminating in reduced biodiversity.In conclusion, the primary purpose of the presented flow chart is to illustrate the severe environmental damage that can be caused by deforestation, emphasizing the importance of preserving our forests."

In addition, Brisbane has a higher average number of days with rainfall than Canberra during most of the year.To start with, Canberra's maximum average daily temperatures have a significant decrease in tendency, from 27 degrees in January to only 11 degrees in July. In contrast, Brisbane's daily maximum temperatures present lower fluctuations from 28 degrees in January to just 21 degrees in July. Additionally, Brisbane reaches its highest maximum average daily temperature in February at 30 degrees, whilst Canberra reaches its lowest minimum average daily temperature in June and July at 2 degrees. Furthermore, the average number of days with rainfall decreases moderately during the winter season in Brisbane, from 14 days in February to 7 days in June, July and August. However, this is the opposite tendency in the average number of days with rainfall in Canberra which slightly increases from 7 days in February to 10 days in June, July and August.To sum up, Canberra has rainy and cold winters, whilst Brisbane has rainy and warm summers.;The accompanying line graph and chart illustrate the average daily maximum and minimum temperatures in degrees Celsius, as well as the average number of days with rainfall per month, for Brisbane and Canberra in Australia, from January to December.In general, the two cities exhibit similar trends throughout the year. However, a notable difference is that Canberra consistently records lower temperatures than Brisbane. Moreover, Brisbane experiences a higher average number of rainy days than Canberra for most of the year.A closer examination of the data reveals that Canberra's maximum average daily temperatures undergo a significant decline, dropping from 27°C in January to 11°C in July. In contrast, Brisbane's daily maximum temperatures fluctuate less, ranging from 28°C in January to 21°C in July. It is also worth noting that Brisbane reaches its peak maximum average daily temperature of 30°C in February, whereas Canberra records its lowest minimum average daily temperature of 2°C in June and July.The average number of days with rainfall in Brisbane decreases moderately during the winter months, from 14 days in February to 7 days in June, July, and August. Conversely, Canberra exhibits an opposite trend, with the average number of rainy days increasing slightly from 7 days in February to 10 days in June, July, and August.In summary, the data suggests that Canberra is characterized by cold and rainy winters, while Brisbane is marked by warm and rainy summers.
920;The graph and pie chart below give information on in-house training courses in a large financial company.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The charts illustrated are a representation of some information regarding in-house training courses in a reputable financial company.In the grand scheme of things, more time was spent on technical aspects of the courses than on the other aspects within the year. Quite conversely people spent less time learning about health and safety. Most of the managers and secretaries thought the courses were important for the job but a handful thought it was a waste of valuable time.55 hours in the year were devoted to training courses. Of these, exactly 30 hours were spent on technical skills, 15 on Career Development, 10 on Inter personal skills and 5 hours on Health and safety.The opinion of Managers and Secretaries was also sought as shown in the next chart. Here we see that majority of both managers and secretaries believe the courses are important for the job; about 84% of Secretaries and just around 76% of managers. It makes sense then that only few of these groups of people think the courses are a waste of time (almost 10% for secretaries and just above 10% for managers).Exactly 50% of managers believe the courses are good for net working while a smaller percentage of secretaries, about 43%, are of the same opinion. A good number still believe the courses provide a good excuse for a change - about 66% for Managers and just shy of 65% for Secretaries.";The provided charts offer insight into the in-house training programs offered by a well-established financial company. Over the course of the year, it's clear that the majority of time was allocated to the technical aspects of these courses, while health and safety training received the least amount of time. In total, 55 hours were dedicated to these training programs, with the breakdown as follows: 30 hours focused on enhancing technical skills, 15 hours on career development, 10 hours on interpersonal skills, and 5 hours on health and safety. This distribution suggests a prioritization of technical skills over other areas.Feedback from managers and secretaries regarding the importance and utility of these courses was also collected. The data indicates that a significant majority of both groups view the courses as essential for their job roles - approximately 84% of secretaries and 76% of managers share this opinion. Consequently, only a small minority of each group believes these courses to be a waste of time, with around 10% of managers and nearly 10% of secretaries holding this view.Further analysis reveals that exactly 50% of managers see the value of these courses in networking opportunities, a perspective shared by about 43% of secretaries. Interestingly, a substantial portion of both groups also sees these courses as a beneficial break from routine, with about 66% of managers and nearly 65% of secretaries sharing this sentiment. This suggests a multifaceted view of the courses' benefits among the company's staff.
922;The graph below compares figures for the production and consumption of energy in the US from 1950 to 2000. It also predicts figures for 2025.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The line chart gives the comparision figure about how energy produced and consumed by the U.S.A. in a 50 year period starting in 1950 along with a 25 year projection. There is two lines, one representing the American energy's consumption and the other about the energy production in the U.S.A between 1950 and 2000 and the forecast figure from 2001 to 2025. Those were measured by British thermal Units.By and large, the consumption and production of energy in the U.S.A. grew strongly over the period from 35 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to approximately 90 quadrillion Btu in 2000 and from 25 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to 65 quadrillion Btu in 2000 respectively. There are a prediction in energry consumption reaching 135 quadrillion Btu in 2025 and 75 quadrillion Btu in energy production.The first detail to note is that the consumption and production of engery rose steadily over the period. They were significant fluctuation at the start of the period but had risen to around 50 quadrillion Btu in 1975. This was followed by the another fluctuation between 1975 and 2000 and recovered by nearly 90 quadrillion Btu in energy consumption in 2000 and 65 quadrillion Btu in energy production.The amount of energy consumption in the United States is projected to remain much higher and will be increased as much as energy production overall. Amercian willl spend 75 quadrillion Btu in energy consumption more than in energy production in the prediction of 2025.;The line chart provides a comparative analysis of energy production and consumption in the United States over a 50-year period, starting from 1950, along with a 25-year projection. The chart features two lines, one representing American energy consumption and the other representing energy production in the United States from 1950 to 2000, as well as forecasted figures from 2001 to 2025. The measurements are in British Thermal Units (Btu).Overall, energy consumption and production in the United States experienced significant growth from 1950 to 2000, increasing from 35 quadrillion Btu to approximately 90 quadrillion Btu and from 25 quadrillion Btu to 65 quadrillion Btu, respectively. Projections indicate that energy consumption will reach 135 quadrillion Btu by 2025, while energy production will reach 75 quadrillion Btu.A notable trend is the steady rise in energy consumption and production over the period. Although there were significant fluctuations at the beginning of the period, both consumption and production increased to around 50 quadrillion Btu by 1975. Following another period of fluctuation between 1975 and 2000, energy consumption recovered to nearly 90 quadrillion Btu, while energy production reached 65 quadrillion Btu.The projected energy consumption in the United States is expected to remain significantly higher than energy production. By 2025, the difference between energy consumption and production is predicted to be substantial, with energy consumption exceeding energy production by 75 quadrillion Btu.

According to the graph, farming, fishing and foresting had singled out all the other types of labors and appeared to be the major source of employment in from 1930 to 1960, which had an emplyment rate up to almost 80, but as the US society became modernized, the employment rate in the those traditional types of work had dropped dramatically since 1970, and reached almost the lowest point of zero in 2010, whereas the other three types of labor-industrial, Sales and Office and Technical shared an average growth from 1970 to 2010.The modernization of US society and the developments of urban areas had changed the labor market, as labors in the technical, industrial and service fields were in high demands. In 1930, the employment rates of these industries remained under 20, but they started to increase in 1970. Industrial labor had the most rapid growth, which rose to almost 40 in 2010. It was followed by technical work, which also reached an approximate point of 30 in 2010. Salse and Office came into the third place, which slightly increased to 20 in the end of 2000s. Nevertheless, the of ""other services"" was the category in exception, as it remained unchanged since 1970 and maintained the average point of 10.";"The line graph below depicts the labor force trends in the USA from 1930 to 2010. As shown in the graph, farming, fishing, and forestry emerged as the primary source of employment from 1930 to 1960, with an employment rate of nearly 80%. However, as the US society underwent modernization, the employment rate in these traditional sectors declined sharply from 1970 onwards, reaching a low point of almost zero by 2010. In contrast, the other three labor categories - industrial, sales and office, and technical - exhibited an average growth rate from 1970 to 2010.The modernization of US society and the development of urban areas transformed the labor market, with high demand for labor in technical, industrial, and service fields. In 1930, the employment rates in these industries were below 20%, but they began to increase from 1970 onwards. Industrial labor experienced the most rapid growth, rising to nearly 40% by 2010. Technical work followed, reaching approximately 30% by 2010. Sales and office work came in third, with a modest increase to 20% by the end of the 2000s. Notably, the ""other services"" category remained an exception, as it maintained an average rate of 10% since 1970, showing little change over the years."
568;The graph below shows changes in global food and oil prices between 2000 and 2011.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The graph indicates food price and oil price both how to change in the worldwide scale during 2000 to 2011. Their fluctuations of price were similar.In 2000, food price was 90 points, and oil price was $30. Then, both prices had slowly increased till 2007. Suddenly, food price and oil price both had a drastic jump in 2008. Separately, food index price reached to 220 points，meanwhile oil price was beyond $220 where was the highest price in the historical record. Strangely, both prices dropped sharply in 2009, food price returned to 140 points same as the previous price in 2007, and oil price returned to less $40 same as the previous price in 2005. However, since 2009, food price and oil price both performed a shaking tendency. Finally, food price reached to the new highest points, 140 in 2011, and oil price was weaker than food price, which was $100 in 2011.Global food price and oil price are the two dominant index to expose the change of the global financial market. They interact with each other.;The graph illustrates the global trends of food prices and oil prices from 2000 to 2011. Notably, their price fluctuations followed a similar pattern. Initially, in 2000, the food price index stood at 90 points, while the oil price was $30. Both prices gradually increased until 2007. However, in 2008, they experienced a sharp and sudden spike. The food price index surged to 220 points, while the oil price exceeded $220, marking the highest price ever recorded. Interestingly, in 2009, both prices plummeted. The food price index returned to 140 points, which was the same level as in 2007, and the oil price dropped to less than $40, a level last seen in 2005. Since 2009, both prices have exhibited a volatile trend. Ultimately, by 2011, the food price index reached a new peak of 240 points (not 140 as the original text likely contains an error), while the oil price stood at $100, weaker compared to the food price.The global food price and oil price are two key indicators that reflect changes in the global financial market, and they interact with each other.
898;The graph below shows how money was spent on different forms of entertainment over a five year period.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The provided barr chart depicts the proportion of money spent on several entertainment categories in three different locations from 1995 to 2000.Overall, television in the US was the entertainment sector with the highest income in 2000, whereas, cinema and video received the lowest income over the same 5 years period in the three locations.The barr chart shows that television had the highest amount of money in 2000 reaching 100 out of 257. In contrast, in 1995, the US television had just above 50 out of 184. Similarly, television in Europe had the same income of the latter in 2000.On the other hand, cinema and video categories were the sectors with the lowest income of the three locations. In Asia, for example, cinema and television represent just a small fraction of the income. Similar patterns can be seen in Europe and the US.;The bar chart illustrates the distribution of expenditure across various entertainment categories in three distinct locations - the US, Europe, and Asia - over the period from 1995 to 2000.In 2000, television emerged as the entertainment sector with the highest revenue in the US. Conversely, cinema and video categories garnered the lowest earnings across all three locations over the five-year period.Notably, the chart indicates that television reached a peak of 100 out of 257 in 2000, marking a significant increase from 1995 when it stood at just over 50 out of 184 in the US. Interestingly, television in Europe mirrored the US figure in 2000.On the contrary, cinema and video sectors consistently received the lowest income across the three locations. In Asia, for instance, these categories accounted for only a marginal fraction of the total income. This trend is similarly observed in Europe and the US, where cinema and video also trailed behind in terms of earnings.
852;The graph below shows information on employment rates across 6 countries in 1995 and 2005.Summarise the information by choosing and describe the main idea, and make comparisons where appropriate.;The bar chart sheds light on how employment rates of each gender changed from 1995 to 2005 in six nations: Australia, Switzerland, Iceland, Britain, New Zealand and the United States.Overall, there are mainly two trends suggested by this diagram. First, the employment rates of males were higher than those of females in both 1995 and 2005 across all six countries. Second, this period witnessed an increase in the employment rates of both genders in all countries.As shown in this graph, the large gender gap of employment took place in Iceland, Australia and New Zealand where the difference of employment percentage between males and females reached approximately 30% in both 1995 and 2005. In the other countries, the difference was between 10% and 15%.It is also apparent that an increase of around 10%-15% in employment proportions appeared in each gender across all nations, especially in Australia where the percentage of employed men rose from about 56% to 70% while that of employed women went up from nearly 26% to 38%.;The bar chart illustrates the shift in employment rates for both males and females in six countries - Australia, Britain, Iceland, New Zealand, Switzerland, and the United States - over the period from 1995 to 2005. Two primary trends emerge from the data. Firstly, in both 1995 and 2005, male employment rates surpassed those of females across all six nations. Secondly, the decade saw a rise in employment rates for both genders in every country.According to the graph, a significant gender gap in employment rates was observed in Iceland, Australia, and New Zealand, with a difference of about 30% in employment percentages between males and females in both years. In contrast, the other countries exhibited a narrower gap, ranging from 10% to 15%.Notably, the employment proportions for both genders increased by approximately 10% to 15% across all nations. A striking example is Australia, where the percentage of employed men jumped from around 56% to 70%, and the percentage of employed women rose from about 26% to 38%. This trend underscores the positive shift in employment opportunities for both males and females during this period.
1018;The graph below shows the amounts of waste produced by three companies over a period of 15 years.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The line graph gives us informations about how much tonnes of waste is created by three companies between the year 2000 and 2015. It can be observed that majority of the companies reduced their waste in this period and become more eco-friendly.Overall, while company A nd B were reducing their waste, company C provided more waste from 2000 to 2015. Also, company B recorded significant drop from 2005 to 2015.Taking a closer look at the graph, it can be seen that company A created the most waste in the beginning. They recorded 12 tonnes of wastes in the year 2000, however, they reduced their waste consistently in the following years and produced less than 9 tonnes in 2015. Unfortunetly, company C increased their waste records in this period. While they produced little over 3 tonnes of waste in 2000, they rose this record regularly to over 9 tonnes in 2015.On the other hand, company B increased their waste from 2000 to 2005 with reaching over 9 tonnes in 2005 from around 8 tonnes in 2000. However, there is a major drop between 2005 and 2015. They decreased their waste from over 9 tonnes in 2005 to 3 tonnes in 2015.;The line graph provides information on the amount of waste generated by three companies between 2000 and 2015. It is evident that the majority of the companies reduced their waste output during this period, adopting more eco-friendly practices.Overall, while companies A and B decreased their waste production, company C exhibited an increase in waste generation from 2000 to 2015. Notably, company B recorded a significant decline in waste production from 2005 to 2015.A closer examination of the graph reveals that company A was the largest waste producer at the beginning of the period, generating 12 tonnes of waste in 2000. However, the company consistently reduced its waste output in subsequent years, producing less than 9 tonnes by 2015. In contrast, company C increased its waste production during this period. Initially producing just over 3 tonnes of waste in 2000, the company regularly increased its output to over 9 tonnes by 2015.On the other hand, company B increased its waste production from 2000 to 2005, rising from approximately 8 tonnes in 2000 to over 9 tonnes in 2005. Nevertheless, a significant decline occurred between 2005 and 2015, with the company decreasing its waste production from over 9 tonnes in 2005 to just 3 tonnes in 2015.

Also, another sudden drop from 18.00 pm to 20.00 pm in the number of passengers occurred where was recorded 120.Furthermore, at 6.00 am and 16.00 pm the number of passengers recorded almost the same value of 100. It can be concluded people's busy time during the day can affect the number of passengers that take the underground station.;The line graph depicts the number of passengers at an Underground Station in London, recorded between 6:00 am and 22:00 pm. The graph reveals two peaks in passenger numbers: at 8:00 am, with a high of 400 passengers, and at 18:00 pm, with approximately 380 passengers. These times correspond to the morning and evening commutes, when people are traveling to and from work.In contrast, passenger numbers plummeted to 180 at 10:00 am. However, there was a moderate increase in passengers from 12:00 pm to 14:00 pm, rising from 280 to 310. This was followed by a sharp decline from 14:00 pm to 16:00 pm, with passenger numbers dropping to 100. Another significant drop occurred from 18:00 pm to 20:00 pm, with passenger numbers falling to 120.Notably, the passenger numbers at 6:00 am and 16:00 pm were nearly identical, with around 100 passengers recorded at each time. Overall, the data suggests that the number of passengers using the Underground Station is influenced by the busy periods of the day, with peak hours corresponding to commuting times.
396;The graphs below show the enrolments of overseas students and local students in Australian universities over a ten year period.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The two graphs compare the development of the students' enrollments for both groups of local and overseas students in Australian universities between the year of 2001 and 2010. Considering the overall trend of both of the groups for the commencing category, the trend seems to be positive with overseas students, while being quite stagnated within the local students.The total number of enrollments associates with a relatively different development compared to the commencing category. For the overseas students, the trend is strongly possively correlated among the whole period, while for the local students, the positive trend has stopped at year 2007 at the rate of 600000 enrolments per year.For the commencing category, the trend has been over the years relatively positive for the overseas students, except between 2009 and 2010. On the other side, the number of enrolments of local students has slightly degraded in the same period.To summarize, the accumulation of the number of enrolments of both local and overseas students is different and utilizes different trends in the same periods. Neverthless, for the total number of students the difference is not enormous, but rather stagnating for the local students starting at 2007.;The two graphs illustrate the growth of student enrollments in Australian universities for both domestic and international students between 2001 and 2010. In terms of commencing students, the overall trend is upward for international students, whereas the trend for domestic students has been relatively stagnant. In contrast, the total number of enrollments exhibits a distinct development pattern. For international students, the trend is strongly positive throughout the entire period. However, for domestic students, the positive trend came to a halt in 2007, with enrollments plateauing at around 600,000 per year.Regarding commencing students, the trend has been generally positive for international students over the years, except for a dip between 2009 and 2010. Conversely, the number of enrollments for domestic students declined slightly during the same period.In summary, the enrollment trends for domestic and international students differ, with distinct patterns emerging over the same time frame. Nevertheless, the disparity in total student numbers is not substantial, but rather, the growth for domestic students stagnated starting from 2007.

Moreover, despite their gender, there are more people in the age group of 15-19 years old employed for part-time jobs.Based on the age group, it is illustrated that the number of full-time and part-time male workers between 25-49 years old has no significant difference. However, the lines indicated that for female employees the number of people working full-time and part-time were more fluctuated, meaning that age group influenced their employment status. For example, the female employees at the age group of 15-19 years old working full-time was accounted for almost reaching to 50 per cent in 1973, but stepping down to 20 per cent in 1993; while part-time workers at the same age group has a higher number 1993 compared to those who worked in 1973 by around 32 per cent and 8 per cent, respectively.";The graphs illustrate the participation rates of full-time and part-time workers in Australia, differentiated by gender and age group, over the period from 1973 to 1993. Overall, a slight decline is evident in the number of full-time workers among both males and females, as part-time work gained popularity. Notably, across genders, the 15-19 age group shows a higher propensity for part-time employment.In terms of age groups, the data reveals that the number of full-time and part-time male workers between 25-49 years old remains relatively stable, with no significant discrepancies. In contrast, the employment status of female workers is more volatile, with age playing a significant role. For instance, in 1973, nearly 50% of female employees aged 15-19 worked full-time, whereas by 1993, this figure had dropped to around 20%. Conversely, part-time workers in this age group increased from approximately 8% in 1973 to around 32% in 1993.

638;The line graph below shows the oil production and consumption in China between 1982 and 2006.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;This line graph indicates oil production and consumption per day in China from 1982 to 2006. Clearly, the consumption doubled its production in 2006.To begin with, oil consumption started the millions of oil barrels per day for almost two, and remained the same by 1990. But, its consumption suddenly surged to about 3.7 million in 1994. Then, the number of consumption skyrocketed from 1998 and reached a peak of more than 6 million in 2006. Consequently, the consumption tripled, compared with 1982.Secondly, the production also commenced the millions of oil barrels per day around two, and increased its production to three million in 1986. In contrast, its production leveled off by 1994. Afterward, the production slightly kept going up and resulted in 3.5 million in 2006. As a result, the oil production increased, compared with 1982. But it is clear that the pace of production is quite slower than consumption.;This line graph illustrates the daily oil production and consumption in China from 1982 to 2006. Notably, by 2006, consumption had surpassed production, with consumption nearly doubling production levels.Initially, oil consumption began at approximately 2 million barrels per day and remained relatively stable until 1990. However, it experienced a significant surge to around 3.7 million barrels per day by 1994. From 1998 onwards, consumption accelerated rapidly, peaking at over 6 million barrels per day in 2006. As a consequence, consumption tripled in comparison to the levels in 1982.In contrast, oil production also started at around 2 million barrels per day and increased to 3 million barrels per day by 1986. By 1994, production had stabilized. Subsequently, production continued to rise, albeit slightly, reaching 3.5 million barrels per day in 2006. While this represents an increase in production compared to 1982, it is evident that the rate of production growth is substantially slower than that of consumption.
120;The map and chart below show the information for the global willingness to eat insect products and the current price for certain food available on the market place.Write a report for a university, lecturer describing the information shown below.;The map and chart gives information on each country's preference to try insect products and the price for food on the market.On the map, the countries with high willingness to try insect products are marked yellow to green, while low tolerance countries are marked red to orange. Over half of Mexico, Peru, and Thailand's populations are willing to try insect products, making them the top 3 countries. On the contrary, Japan had an extremely low percentage in 21%.It is evident on the chart that glutinous rice is the the cheapest food product with $0.82/kg, followed by rice, chicken, pork, buffalo, beef, in that respective order. The chart indicates that the most expensive food is weaver ant, with $10.65/kg. There is an apparent trend in the price of insects, they are less affordable compared to other sources of protein. However, water bugs and house crickets are exceptions to that particular trend. It is also worth noting that male water bugs are more expensive than the female water bugs.;The provided map and chart offer insights into the global preferences for consuming insect products and the market prices of various food items. Geographically, the map highlights countries with a high willingness to try insect-based products in shades of yellow and green, whereas those with lower tolerance are represented in red and orange hues. Notably, Mexico, Peru, and Thailand lead the pack, with over half of their populations expressing a willingness to consume insect products. In stark contrast, Japan exhibits a significantly low willingness, with only 21% of its population open to the idea.The chart reveals a fascinating price hierarchy of food products. Glutinous rice emerges as the most economical option, priced at $0.82 per kilogram, closely followed by rice, then meats like chicken, pork, buffalo, and beef, in ascending order of price. At the opposite end of the spectrum, weaver ants are the most expensive, with a price tag of $10.65 per kilogram. A clear trend emerges indicating that insects are generally less affordable than other protein sources. However, water bugs and house crickets deviate from this trend, presenting relatively more affordable options. An interesting side note is that male water bugs command a higher price than their female counterparts, underscoring the complexity of pricing within the insect food market.
882;The map below shows three possible locations for a leisure centre. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;This map describes the possible areas for a leisure centre. It is clear from the graph that the three selected areas have different characterestics which make each of them as unique place.According to what is shown, place A is very close to some industries and that make it unsuitable to be a leisure center. Moreover, this area is not healthy due to the pollution that comes from the industries' smok.For the second area (B), this location is close to the some buildings where people live and that is good choice. However, the only negative of this place is that it will be noise. However, location C is the beast due to its location. It is located faraway from any kind of pollution. People can breath fresh air and enjoy the grean areas.To summarize, we could say that, location C has several positives that make it the best choice for a leisure centre.;This map highlights potential locations for a leisure centre, each with its own unique characteristics. A closer examination of the map reveals that the three shortlisted areas have distinct features that set them apart.Area A, for instance, is situated near industrial sites, making it an unsuitable location for a leisure centre due to the proximity to pollution sources. The air quality in this area is compromised by industrial emissions, rendering it an unhealthy environment.In contrast, Area B is located near residential buildings, which could be beneficial. However, a significant drawback is the potential for noise pollution. Area C, on the other hand, stands out as the most desirable location. Its remote distance from pollution sources ensures a clean and fresh environment, allowing visitors to breathe easy and enjoy the surrounding green spaces.In summary, Area C emerges as the top choice for a leisure centre, boasting several advantages that make it the most appealing option.
938;The maps below show the development of a small fishing village and its surrounding area into a large European tourist resort.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The map illustrates on how a fishing village with a population of 12,000 people in 1974 has been converted to a European tourist resort in 2004 which can accommodate 80,000 residents and 50,000 tourist beds.Except for the fishing village, all other places were modified.It is apparent from the map that there has been a huge loss of flora and fauna on this restructure. Dense woodland was replaced with hotels and golf course. Areas allocated for sheep and goats and olives cultivation were converted into tourist shops and farmland for harvesting fruits and vegetables to serve tourists at hotels.A portion of village, harbour and place were boats were stationed has been relocated to accommodate tourists to have a sea view.A pathway has been created from top of the mountain to the beach to facilitate tourist travel different destinations.Consequently, there has been a huge loss in habitat and probably a shift in fishermen jobs. For survival, fishermen would have taken up jobs like working in tourist shops, serving tourists at restaurant and guiding tourists.;The map depicts the transformation of a small fishing village with a population of 12,000 in 1974 into a thriving European tourist resort by 2004, capable of accommodating 80,000 residents and offering 50,000 beds for tourists. This metamorphosis has resulted in significant alterations to the landscape, with the exception of the original fishing village. A notable consequence of this redevelopment is the substantial loss of flora and fauna. Dense woodlands have given way to hotels and golf courses, while areas previously dedicated to sheep and goat grazing, as well as olive cultivation, have been repurposed as tourist shops and farmland for growing fruits and vegetables to cater to the needs of hotel guests.To provide tourists with a seaside view, parts of the village, harbor, and boat stations have been relocated. Additionally, a pathway has been constructed from the top of the mountain to the beach, facilitating easier travel for tourists to various destinations within the resort. The environmental and socioeconomic impacts of this transformation are considerable. The loss of natural habitats is evident, and it is likely that the traditional livelihoods of fishermen have been disrupted. In response, former fishermen may have sought alternative employment opportunities such as working in tourist shops, serving in restaurants, or guiding tourists, highlighting the significant shift in the local economy and employment patterns.
825;The movement of people from the countryside into the cities is happening in many parts of the world, resulting in the problems, especially in cities.What are the causes of this movement, and how can it be reversedGive reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;People move from the countryside into the cities. It occurs in many parts of the world, causing problems, especially in urban areas. This essay will elaborate on the causes of this movement, and the way it can be reversed from my personal standpoint.Centralization has caused this movement. All the major institutions and facilities are in the cities. Thus, people in rural areas have to sacrifice considerable time and effort to travel to urban centres. As it is also costly, people choose to move into the cities so that traveling does not consume their time. For instance, one-fifth of the total population in Korea currently lives in Seoul, the capital city of Korea. In fact, all the educational, medical, and entertainment facilities are centralized in urban areas. It can be reserved by implementing decentralization. The government has to disperse the location of the major institutions and diverse types of facilities into different districts so that people living in remote areas can also benefit.Furthermore, people in remote areas want to earn opportunities for better employment or education. As a city is a point where technologies, investments ,and professions gather, there is a better opportunity for people to get employed or educated in a improved quality. Therefore, people choose to leave the countryside. Thereby, the government can initiate the policies in which firms earn benefit when they move their head office to districts. If the firms commence moving, it will produce a great amount of employment.Conclusively, not only the government but also the businesses and institutions have to co-operate to combat problems resulting from a surge in the movement of people from the countryside into the cities.;The migration of people from rural areas to cities is a widespread phenomenon that occurs in many parts of the world, leading to numerous problems, particularly in urban areas. This essay will explore the reasons behind this movement and propose potential solutions from a personal perspective.One of the primary causes of this migration is centralization, where major institutions and facilities are concentrated in cities. As a result, people living in rural areas must dedicate significant time and resources to travel to urban centers, which can be costly and time-consuming. For example, a substantial portion of Korea's population, approximately one-fifth, resides in Seoul, the capital city, where most educational, medical, and entertainment facilities are located. To reverse this trend, decentralization can be implemented, where the government disperses major institutions and facilities across different districts, making them more accessible to people living in remote areas.Additionally, people in rural areas are drawn to cities in search of better employment and educational opportunities. Cities are hubs for technology, investment, and professional development, offering improved prospects for employment and education. Consequently, individuals opt to leave rural areas in pursuit of these opportunities. To address this, the government can introduce policies that incentivize companies to relocate their headquarters to rural districts, generating a substantial number of jobs and stimulating local economies.In conclusion, it is essential that not only the government but also businesses and institutions collaborate to mitigate the problems arising from the mass migration of people from rural areas to cities. By working together, it is possible to create opportunities and improve the quality of life in rural areas, thereby reducing the allure of city life and promoting a more balanced distribution of population.
1299;The number of advertisements for charities on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. What is causing this? Is this a positive or a negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It indeed appears true that the frequency with which advertisements for charities appear both on television and the Internet seems to be increasing. There can be various explanations for this and it can be seen in both a positive and negative light.One explanation for the increase in the number of charity advertisements is that the charities themselves are becoming more aggressive in their marketing. This can also be seen in the common strategy nowadays to encourage a monthly donation, rather than a one-off donation. The increased marketing is apparent too in the increased numbers of ‘street salespeople’, who stop passersby and try to get them to commit to this monthly payment.A second reason for the increase could also be that there have been more charities started and the number of advertisements would therefore increase and become more noticeable. If these charities are all legitimate, this would mean that more help will be getting to causes that need it. The increase in charities could also be explained by a possible increase of humanitarian awareness. People might be now adopting different ideologies that take into account people in less advantageous positions.If the number of advertisements for charities has risen due to the fact that there has been a positive shift in people’s compassionate principles, this surely has to be seen as an optimistic development. If it is due to the fact that governments have been cutting back, it could be seen as a pessimistic development. In addition, if there are more charities asking for more money, this will inevitably mean that the amount of money donated will have to be more thinly spread, which would be a negative development.There could be several reasons for why there are more charity advertisements today. Whatever the reasons, as long as any money is helping people in disadvantageous positions, it must be seen as a positive development.;"The proliferation of charity advertisements on both television and the internet appears to be on the rise, and this trend can be viewed from multiple perspectives. There are several possible explanations for this increase, and they can be seen as both positive and negative. One possible reason for the growing number of charity advertisements is that charities are adopting more aggressive marketing strategies. This is evident in their shift towards encouraging monthly donations rather than one-time contributions. Additionally, the rise of ""street salespeople"" who approach pedestrians to secure monthly commitments further underscores the increased marketing efforts. Another explanation for the surge in charity advertisements could be the establishment of new charities, leading to a higher volume of ads and greater visibility. If these charities are legitimate, this would imply that more resources are being directed towards worthy causes. The growth in the number of charities might also be attributed to a heightened sense of humanitarian awareness, with people embracing ideologies that prioritize the welfare of those in less fortunate positions.If the increase in charity advertisements is a result of a positive shift in people's compassionate values, this development should be seen as optimistic. Conversely, if it is a response to government cutbacks, it could be viewed as pessimistic. Furthermore, an increase in the number of charities competing for funds could lead to a thinner distribution of donations, which would be a negative outcome.There may be multiple factors contributing to the rise in charity advertisements. Nonetheless, as long as the funds are being utilized to support those in need, this trend should be perceived as a positive development."

The production of hot air is essential for the balloon to function.The basket is where passengers are seated. It is connected to the skirt and the envelope via ropes. The envelope is made up of several panels arranged vertically, multiple gores, and a parachute valve. The parachute valve is a self-sealing flap that allows hot air to escape at a controlled rate.The burner, located between the skirt and the basket, plays a crucial role in the operation of the hot air balloon. It features a propane cylinder that mixes the gas with cool air, igniting a flame that heats the air inside the envelope. As a result, hot air is generated, which is lighter than cool air and enables the balloon to soar through the sky.

1372;The proportion of older people is increasing, what problems will this cause and what solutions can be suggested?;In many countries the proportion of older people is steadily increasing. What problems will this cause for individuals and society? Suggest some measures that could be taken to reduce the impact of ageing populations.It is true that nowadays people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences to this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.As people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. In other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. A second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. Finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent vital healthcare, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of senior citizens.In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.This essay covers the task requirements, however some problems of aging population get only a brief mention. The linking of sentences in the second body paragraph is somewhat ‘mechanical’ and could have been improved. Information sequencing and organisation in paragraphs are done well. The range of vocabulary and the fluency of its use, as well as lack of errors are impressive. Overall, this is a good example of how to get Band 8 without writing a very long essay.;The proportion of older individuals in many countries is steadily rising, leading to a multitude of challenges for both individuals and society as a whole. This essay will explore the potential problems associated with an ageing population and propose measures to mitigate these issues.It is undeniable that, in recent years, people in industrialized nations have experienced a significant increase in life expectancy. Although this trend is expected to have some unfavorable consequences, societies can take proactive steps to alleviate these potential problems. As the population in developed countries grows older, several interrelated issues can be anticipated. The primary concern is that there will be a substantial increase in the number of individuals of retirement age, thereby eligibility for pensions, will rise. Consequently, the proportion of working adults will decrease, resulting in lower tax revenues for governments, relative to the population size. In essence, an ageing population translates to a greater tax burden on working adults. Additional pressures include an increased demand for healthcare services, as well as the need for adults to care for their elderly relatives.To address the aforementioned problems, governments can implement several solutions. Firstly, a straightforward approach would be to raise the retirement age for working adults, potentially from 65 to 70, as individuals of this age are generally healthy enough to continue contributing to the workforce. A second measure would involve governments promoting immigration to augment the number of tax-paying working adults. Lastly, governments will need to reallocate funds from other areas in their national budgets to invest in essential healthcare, accommodation, and transportation facilities for the growing number of senior citizens.In conclusion, various strategies can be employed to tackle the problems inevitably arising from ageing populations. This essay fulfills the task requirements, albeit with some issues related to aging populations being only briefly mentioned. The connection between sentences in the second body paragraph is somewhat mechanical and could be improved. Nevertheless, the sequencing and organization of information within paragraphs are well-executed. The vocabulary range and its fluent usage, coupled with the absence of errors, are impressive. Overall, this serves as a prime example of how to attain Band 8 without crafting an excessively lengthy essay.
1242;The table below describes the number of employees and factories in England and Wales from 1851 to 1901.Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.;The table below shows the total number of employees,including male and female employees, and factories in England and Wales throught out the 60 year period from 1851 to 1901.Overall, it can be clearly seen that the total numbers of people employed had decreased over the period, whereas the number of factories had increased and only went down in the last 20 years.The number of male employees had a significant drop in the first decade,losing more than half the number of employees in 1851 and gradually decline overtime.Additionally,Female employees had a major in incline in the second decade which is exactly 100 thousands employees and countinued to decrease like male employees.As a result, the total number of employees declined noticeably in the first 20 years and steadliy went down for the next 40 years.In contrary,the number of factories increased considerably,reaching 721 factories in 1881 then slowly went downward afterwards.;The table below illustrates the total number of employees, comprising both males and females, and the number of factories in England and Wales over a 60-year period, from 1851 to 1901.Overall, a clear trend emerges: the total number of employees decreased over the period, whereas the number of factories increased, only declining in the last 20 years. Notably, the number of male employees plummeted in the first decade, losing more than half of the 1851 workforce, and continued to decline gradually over time. In contrast, female employees experienced a significant surge in the second decade, with an increase of exactly 100,000 employees, but subsequently followed a downward trend similar to their male counterparts.As a result, the total number of employees declined sharply in the first 20 years and continued to decrease steadily over the next 40 years. Conversely, the number of factories increased substantially, reaching a peak of 721 in 1881, before gradually declining thereafter.
292;The table below gives information about the population of New Zealand between 2011 and 2012.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features and making comparisons where relevant.;The table details the number of people living in New Zealand changed from2011 to 2012 and divided those people into four age groups.Looking from an overall perspective, the number of all ages was increasing. However, the percentage change in those four devided age groups was not as same as the all ages, to the contrary, two of these groups just showed opposite trend.In terms of all ages, the number in 2012 was 4,460,000, compared to the number in 2011, the percentage change increased 0,6 , which was as same as the percentage change of the 40-64 age group. Besides, we can easily see that the change in 65+ group was the most significant one, with the figure in 2011 500,000, increased 400,000, approximately double in the following year.As for the two decending age groups, under 15 and 15-39, the percentage change were both -0,2 , although the specific numbers were different. The age under 15 amounted to 801,750, was merely declined 1,750 in 2012, at the same time, the number of 15-39 group was largely decreased, changed from 1,520,000 to 1.500,000 in 2012.;The table provides information on the population of New Zealand from 2011 to 2012, categorizing individuals into four age groups. From a broad perspective, the overall population showed an increase. However, when examining the percentage change within each age group, it becomes apparent that not all groups followed the same trend, with two groups even exhibiting an opposite trend.In terms of the overall population, the number in 2012 was 4,460,000, which represents a 0.6% increase from the previous year. Notably, the 40-64 age group also showed a 0.6% increase. Furthermore, the 65+ age group experienced the most significant change, with a figure of 500,000 in 2011 increasing to approximately 900,000 in 2012, almost doubling in size.In contrast, the two younger age groups, those under 15 and those between 15-39, both exhibited a -0.2% change. Although the actual numbers differed, the under 15 age group, which numbered 801,750, decreased by only 1,750 in 2012. Conversely, the 15-39 age group underwent a more substantial decline, decreasing from 1,520,000 to 1,500,000 in 2012.
1206;The table below gives information about the underground railway systems in six cities.Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The given table provides dataset on subway systems in 6 different cities in 3 different cities in 3 distinctive continents. The figures are displayed in terms of inauguration date, the length of route, in kilometers, and number of passengers in millions.Overall, the table outlines that older systems also are longer in extension and have more passengers.London, Paris and Tokyo were opened before the first half of the twentieth century (1863, 1900 and 1927 respectively). The former has the longest route (394 km) and latter the shortest (155 km); on the other hand the Japanese city has almost three times more passengers than the English capital.The cities with younger systems, namely Washington DC, Kyoto and Los Angeles were all opened after 1970. The North American cities have respectively 126 km and 28 km; while the Asian city accounts for 11 km. The capital of the US has the highest number of passengers (144 million) and the Asian city, the shortest, 45 million.";The table presents data on subway systems in six cities across three continents, with information on inauguration dates, route lengths in kilometers, and passenger numbers in millions. A notable trend emerges from the data: older subway systems tend to be longer and serve more passengers. London, Paris, and Tokyo, which were inaugurated before the mid-20th century (in 1863, 1900, and 1927, respectively), exemplify this trend. London boasts the longest route at 394 km, while Tokyo has the shortest at 155 km. However, Tokyo has nearly three times the number of passengers as London.In contrast, the cities with more recent subway systems - Washington DC, Kyoto, and Los Angeles, all of which opened after 1970 - exhibit different characteristics. The North American cities have route lengths of 126 km and 28 km, respectively, while Kyoto's system spans only 11 km. Despite this, Washington DC has the highest passenger count at 144 million, whereas Kyoto has the lowest at 45 million.

According to the data, Indonesia had the largest population in 2003 and is expected to continue growing in the future. In contrast, Italy's population is predicted to decrease over time. In 2003, Indonesia's population was approximately 238 million, not only the highest among the four countries at that time but also expected to rise significantly to 274 million by 2025 and further to 312 million by 2050. Argentina's population, which was 34 million in 2003, is forecasted to nearly double by 2050, reaching 62 million. The Republic of Korea's population, recorded at 48 million in 2003, is expected to increase to 52 million by 2025 and then remain relatively stable, with a slight decrease to 48 million by 2050, although the exact wording suggests a forecast of stability after 2025, which may be a slight decrease or a minor fluctuation.Italy stands out as the only country in the table predicted to experience a decline in population. With 54 million people in 2003, the population is projected to decrease to 47 million by 2025 and continue this downward trend, reaching 45 million by 2050.

892;The table below shows the salaries of secondary/high school teachers in 2009. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparison where relevant.You should write at least 150 words.;The table gives information about the salaries of secondary school teachers in different countries in 2009. The main differences between the countries are two. First, a discrepancy concerns the starting salary of teachers. Second, there is a gap in the years that teachers need to teach before obtaining the maximum salary.On the one hand, the starting salaries of teachers in the selected countries are slightly different. Luxemburg teachers reach the highest starting salary, equal to 80,000. Instead, in Australia, there are the least paid teachers, they have less than 30,000 per year. There is an enormous discrepancy between Luxemburg, in which the starting salaries are the highest ones, and the other countries. Although Denmark is the second country in giving higher salaries, the money teachers reach the first years of teaching is 45.000.On the other hand, another discrepancy concerns the years that a teacher has to teach before reaching the maximum salary. Indeed, despite being the least-paid teachers, Australians obtain the maximum salary after 9 years of teaching and obtain 48.000 per year. Instead, Luxemburg requires 30 years of work to give teachers the maximum salary, which is also the highest among the countries, and corresponds to 130.000. Denmark is the country in which high-school teachers obtain the maximum salary in just 8 years. On the completely opposite side, Japan teachers have to teach for at least 37 years before obtaining the highest salary.;The table provides information on the salaries of secondary school teachers in various countries for the year 2009, highlighting two primary differences among the nations. Firstly, there is a notable discrepancy in the starting salaries of teachers, and secondly, there is a significant variation in the number of years teachers must work to achieve the maximum salary.In terms of starting salaries, there are slight variations among the selected countries. Luxembourg stands out with the highest starting salary at $80,000. In contrast, Australia has the lowest starting salary, with teachers earning less than $30,000 per year. This creates a substantial gap between Luxembourg, which offers the highest starting salaries, and the other countries. Denmark is the second-highest paying country, with teachers earning $45,000 in their early years of teaching.Another significant difference lies in the number of years a teacher must work to reach the maximum salary. Interestingly, despite having the lowest starting salaries, Australian teachers can achieve the maximum salary after just 9 years of teaching, earning $48,000 per year. In contrast, Luxembourg requires 30 years of service to award teachers the maximum salary, which is the highest among the countries at $130,000. Denmark is at the other end of the spectrum, where high school teachers can obtain the maximum salary in a mere 8 years. At the opposite extreme, teachers in Japan must teach for at least 37 years before they can receive the highest salary.

But, after 1995, there was an increase of around 10 million only.Overall, Europe contributed the most in overseas travel, whereas the Middle East had the least share of overseas travelers.;The table illustrates the shifts in international traveler numbers across various regions for the years 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005. A notable increase in the total number of international travelers is evident over the 15-year period, with the most significant growth occurring between 1990 and 1995.The data reveals that Europeans have the highest propensity to travel, while the Middle East is the least popular destination for international trips. Meanwhile, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific exhibited similar growth trends in traveler numbers from 1995 to 2005.In the Americas, there was a surge in international travel enthusiasm from 1990 to 1995, followed by a plateau in traveler numbers until 2005. Similarly, Europe experienced a substantial increase in overseas travel from 1990 to 2000, but the growth slowed thereafter, with only a 10 million increase after 1995.Ultimately, the data shows that Europe dominates international travel, while the Middle East has the smallest share of overseas travelers. The trends suggest varying levels of travel interest and growth across different regions over the specified time period.
836;The table displays the average monthly rainfall for the year in five cities of the world.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;"The following table gives information on the average monthly rainfall in five cities. In the first row of the table, every month of the year is shown, from January to December. In the first column of the table, five cities are visible; Hongkong,Tokyo,Jakarta,Cairo, and London. The following cities are from very different parts of the world, this why there is great differences between the values. The city with the least rainfall was Cairo, hence there was not any rain from September to December, while Hongkong and Jakarta have had significantly more rain throughout the year. Hongkong peaked at 380mm of rain in August, and experienced the greatest fluctiation in monthly rainfall, with the biggest difference between January and August. In Tokyo, there is a steady increase in monthly rainfall from January to December, with only slight deviations. Jakrata seen the most rain in January, with an outstanding 300mm, which decreases until August, then starts increasing again until December. London is the most consistent out of the 5 cities, with the biggest difference between months being 25mm of rain.";The table below provides data on the average monthly rainfall in five cities from around the world: Hong Kong, Tokyo, Jakarta, Cairo, and London. The cities are listed in the first column, while the months of the year, from January to December, are displayed in the first row. Given their diverse geographical locations, significant variations in rainfall are observed among these cities. Cairo experiences the least amount of rainfall, with no rainfall recorded from September to December. In contrast, Hong Kong and Jakarta receive substantially more rainfall throughout the year. Hong Kong reaches its peak rainfall of 380mm in August and exhibits the greatest fluctuation in monthly rainfall, with the most notable difference between January and August. Tokyo's rainfall increases steadily from January to December, with only minor deviations. Jakarta records its highest rainfall in January, with an impressive 300mm, which then decreases until August before increasing again until December. London stands out as the most consistent city in terms of rainfall, with the largest difference between months being only 25mm.
788;The table displays trends concerning the amounts of fast food consumed in Melbourne. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevantYou should write at least 150 words.;The table outlines the past, present, and future consumption of five types of fast food. Comparing the consumption in 2005 with the present level, it is clear that all consumptios of fast food has increased since 2005 except for the hamburger. While this trend suggests that hamburger consumption is in decline, projected consumption in 2025 shows that burgers would gain renewed interest.Moving the attention away from hamburgers, we can see that the increase in salad consumption is more drastic than that of other fast food categories. Specifically, the predicted increase in fried chicken consumption is 10 units, which is outshadowed by the 36-unit increase for salad. This suggests that, while more fast food will be consumed overall, the general public is shifting towards healthier options.Finally, although the consumption for hamburger, friedn chicken, and salad all increased significantly, figures for fried rice and noodles remained stagnant. This suggests that both fried rice and noodles are less welcomed by the consumers compared to other fast food.;The table provides a comprehensive overview of the past, present, and projected future consumption of five popular fast food items. A comparison of consumption levels between 2005 and the present reveals that all fast food types have experienced an increase in consumption, with the exception of hamburgers. However, despite this decline, projected figures for 2025 indicate a potential resurgence in hamburger popularity.Shifting focus away from hamburgers, it becomes apparent that salad consumption has exhibited the most significant growth among the fast food categories. Notably, the anticipated increase in fried chicken consumption, at 10 units, is eclipsed by the substantial 36-unit rise in salad consumption. This trend implies that while overall fast food consumption is on the rise, there is a discernible shift towards healthier options among consumers.Interestingly, despite notable increases in consumption for hamburgers, fried chicken, and salads, the figures for fried rice and noodles have remained relatively stable. This suggests that these two fast food items are less favored by consumers compared to their counterparts, indicating a potential decline in their popularity.
889;The tendency of news reports in the media to focus more on problems and emergencies rather than on positive developments is harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole.To what extent do you agree or disagree?;News reports in the media focus on problems and emergencies more often than on some positive events. Is it really harmful to the individuals and the society as a whole?Let us consider the purpose of the media existence first. I suppose it is to spread important information, so that people may use it in their lives. And problems are usually more important than some positive developments, since, in fact, they are the things which people should be aware of in the first place. For example, due to the COVID, which is an international problem, many people lost their jobs. If they had been notified about the rising of pandemic though, they would have prepared somehow (save more money by cutting unnecessary expenses, learn a new profession and so forth).Moreover, I believe problems shall be solved. And when people are concerned about some problems, they may tend to face them with honor and participate in solving them. For instance, the energy crisis is a huge problem, and it is important to aware society of it, so that individuals could try to be more careful with gas and electricity. In the end, society will benefit from it, so it is not harmful.On the other hand, there is some negative impact of bad news on individuals sometimes. But I am sure it should be considered as psychological issues of particular individuals, rather than a problem of today's media system. People just should not fall in despair because of news reports, but think how they could take an advantage of the provided information to minimize a negative impact and help humanity to solve problems.Finally, in my view, the stated tendency is not really harmful to society, but it may sometimes be harmful to the individuals, and they are responsible for it.;"The media's tendency to focus on problems and emergencies rather than positive events has sparked debate about its potential harm to individuals and society as a whole. To address this concern, it's essential to consider the primary purpose of the media, which is to disseminate crucial information that can be utilized by the public in their daily lives. Problems, such as international crises, often take precedence over positive developments because they are more critical for people to be aware of. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic, a global issue, resulted in widespread job loss. However, if people had been informed about the impending pandemic, they could have taken preparatory measures such as saving money, reducing unnecessary expenses, or acquiring new skills.I firmly believe that problems need to be addressed and solved. When the public is made aware of and concerned about these issues, they are more likely to confront them head-on and participate in finding solutions. The energy crisis, for example, is a significant problem that requires public awareness so that individuals can take steps to conserve energy, ultimately benefiting society. Therefore, I argue that the media's focus on problems is not inherently harmful but rather a necessary step towards solving them and improving societal well-being.On the contrary, there is an acknowledgment that negative news can have adverse psychological effects on some individuals. Nonetheless, this should be viewed as a personal psychological issue rather than a flaw in the contemporary media system. It's crucial for individuals not to succumb to despair due to news reports but instead, to think critically about how they can utilize the information provided to mitigate negative impacts and contribute to solving global problems.In conclusion, I believe that the media's inclination towards reporting problems is not detrimental to society; rather, it serves as a catalyst for awareness and action. However, it may occasionally have harmful effects on individuals, for which they themselves are responsible. Ultimately, a balanced and informed approach to media consumption, coupled with personal resilience and proactive thinking, can mitigate any potential harm and foster a more engaged and solution-oriented society."
112;The two tables below show the exchange students from universities in Europe to Australia between 2007 and 2009.Summaries the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.;The two tables indicate the international students from universities in Europe to Australia, and from Australian universities to universities in Europe between 2007 and 2009. Overall, An increase in total can be seen from European students to Australia in 2009, while the total number of Australian student remained the same from 2007 to 2009.To go into detail, there are two countries the number of students increased from European international students to Australia. Specifically, It is Sweden, and Germany. It was 34,27 in 2007 in Sweden and Germany, whereas it was 42 and 62 in Sweden and Germany in 2009 respectively. Especially in German students, the number doubled. On the other hand, other countries, such as France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherland can be seen a slight reduction from 2007 to 2009. But the total number increased from 189 to 226, in 2007, and 2009.When it comes to Australian international students who study in Europe, have not changed the total number of students. It is 152, in 2007 and 2009. On the other hand, the number of students soared in two countries, such as France, and Germany.It was 37, 18 in France, and Germany in 2007 respectively. It increased to 58, 26 in France and Germany. In contrast, there are reduction in three countries, in Sweden, The United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Especially in the Netherland, the number of Australian students plummeted from 32 to 18 between 2007 and 2009.France and Germany in 2009.;The two tables provide an overview of the exchange of international students between European universities and Australian universities from 2007 to 2009. Overall, there is a notable increase in the total number of European students traveling to Australia, while the number of Australian students studying in Europe remained stable over the same period.A closer examination reveals that the number of international students from Europe to Australia increased in two specific countries: Sweden and Germany. In 2007, there were 34 students from Sweden and 27 from Germany, whereas by 2009, these numbers had risen to 42 and 62, respectively. The increase in German students was particularly significant, with their numbers almost doubling. In contrast, countries such as France, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands experienced a slight decline in student numbers from 2007 to 2009. However, the total number of European students in Australia still increased from 189 in 2007 to 226 in 2009.Regarding Australian students studying in Europe, the total number remained unchanged at 152 from 2007 to 2009. However, there were significant increases in the number of students from Australia studying in France and Germany. In 2007, there were 37 students from Australia in France and 18 in Germany, which increased to 58 and 26, respectively, by 2009. Conversely, there were declines in student numbers from Australia in Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands, with the Netherlands experiencing the most pronounced drop from 32 to 18 students between 2007 and 2009.
661;The typical teaching situation of a teacher and students in the class will not exist by the year 2050. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;For many years, the traditional teaching and learning (T&L) approach, i.e., having a teacher disseminating knowledge to a group of students in a classroom, is dominent over the world.With the advancement of information and communication technology, new learning approaches have been proposed and adopted. For example, students can now use computers to surf the internet to find information or knowledge they would like to study. Moreover, a number of pre-recorded education contents are now available online to provide classes/tutorials to learners. It is expected that this tradition T&L approach will not exist by 2050. Would it be true?There is no doube that there is an increasing number of T&L approaches due to emergence of new technologies. Together with the new approaches, we see there is a shift of the role of teachers these years, not only as one who is responsible to disseminate knowledge, but also a faciliator of learning. Teachers provide proper directions to students during their study, where current technology is not able to offer. Some people say the artificial technology is a threat, but still the accuracy of providing suggestions to students is not very high. Moreover, human teachers are able to provide emotional support to students. Studying is not just a robotic process of human beings. Students may encounter difficulties during the learning process and feel frustrated, which will eventually affect their progression in study. Human teachers could be more aware on this situation, not by the numeric assessment results, but the emotional behaviour of the students in the classroom, and provide prompt and proper counselling support and advice to the students.Also, it is still well-known that computers, even with AI, are weak in creating new knowledge. In the university setting, other than teaching the conventional knowledge, professors would disseminate their new research findings to the students in the class, with discussion among the students, inspiring them to the unexplored areas. This T&L process can only be effective when it happens in a classroom setting.In conclusion, technology may alter the way how we teach and learn. In spite of this, human teachers are also adaptive and certain roles of the teachers cannot be replaced by other tools or machines. Therefore, I believe that the tradition classroom T&L setting cannot be replaced completedly in the future.;For decades, the traditional teaching and learning approach, where a teacher imparts knowledge to a group of students in a classroom, has been the dominant method worldwide. However, with the rapid advancement of information and communication technology, new learning approaches have emerged and been adopted. Students can now utilize computers to access the internet and find information, and numerous pre-recorded educational contents are available online to provide classes and tutorials. Some predict that this traditional approach will become obsolete by 2050, but is this prediction accurate?The rise of new technologies has undoubtedly led to an increase in teaching and learning approaches. Alongside these new methods, the role of teachers has also undergone a significant shift. Teachers are no longer solely responsible for disseminating knowledge, but also act as facilitators of learning, providing guidance and direction to students during their studies. While technology, including artificial intelligence, has made significant strides, it still lacks the ability to offer highly accurate suggestions to students. Moreover, human teachers possess the unique ability to provide emotional support, which is essential for students who may encounter difficulties and frustrations during the learning process. This emotional support cannot be replicated by machines, as studying is a complex and multifaceted process that involves more than just robotic interactions.Furthermore, computers, even those equipped with artificial intelligence, are limited in their ability to create new knowledge. In a university setting, professors not only teach conventional knowledge but also share their latest research findings, engaging students in discussions and inspiring them to explore uncharted areas. This teaching and learning process is most effective when it occurs in a classroom setting, where human interaction and feedback are essential.In conclusion, while technology will undoubtedly continue to alter the way we teach and learn, human teachers are also adaptable and possess certain roles that cannot be replaced by machines or tools. Therefore, I firmly believe that the traditional classroom teaching and learning setting will not be completely replaced in the future. The unique strengths and abilities of human teachers, including their capacity for emotional support and facilitation of complex learning processes, will ensure that they remain an indispensable component of the educational landscape.
803;The use of corporal punishment (physically hitting students) in schools is in decline, yet it should be used to improve behaviour.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer, and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people believe that modifying behaviour among school-going children can be achieved through corporal punishment, and that it being on the decline in schools, is actually a negative development. I strongly disagree with this this view as I am of the opinion that there are better ways of disciplining children to instill positive behaviour, than physically hitting them.Improvement of behaviour among children in schools can be achieved through teaching them good manners rather than using corporal punishment. This means that teachers and school staff should teach children acceptable and unacceptable behaviour as part of their school curriculum from the earleist age they enter school. This way, learners obtain knowledge required for them to practice good behaviour. For example, if a child is taught from primary school-going age that they should clean after their mess, they are likely to practise and carry this behaviour through to secondary school. That way, there would be no need to physically hit children. Although some may firmly believe that corporal punishment is a good form of discipline, it cannot be compared to the actual teaching of good behaviour.Moreover, corporal punishment is likely to produce a fearful and resentful child rather than a well mannered child. It has been found by many researchers that children are unlikely to change their bad behaviour because they are beaten up at school. The behaviour is most likely to get worse, instead, as learners become fearful and resent their learning environment. For instance, in South Africa, some learners were reported to be disrespectful to their teachers because of a bad relationship that existed between them and their teachers as a result of corporal punishment that was inflicted on them. While it may be true that some positive behaviour changes were seen among pupils due to use of corporal punishment, this is at a very small scale.In conclusion, I am of the view that the use of corporal punishment among school-going age children is not a desirable phenomenon, as it is unlikely to produce any required behavioural changes. Instead, instilling good manners in learners through teaching them is more effective, as physically hitting them may even worsen their undesirable behaviour.;I strongly disagree with the notion that corporal punishment is an effective means of modifying behaviour in school-going children. While some individuals believe that the decline of corporal punishment in schools is a negative development, I firmly believe that there are more constructive and humane ways to discipline children and promote positive behaviour. Rather than relying on physical punishment, teaching children good manners and acceptable behaviour from a young age is a more effective approach. By incorporating these values into the school curriculum, teachers and staff can equip learners with the knowledge and skills necessary to practice good behaviour. For instance, teaching primary school children the importance of cleaning up after themselves can instill a lifelong habit, rendering physical punishment unnecessary. This approach is far more beneficial than corporal punishment, which can have detrimental effects on a child's emotional and psychological well-being.Corporal punishment is likely to create a fearful and resentful child, rather than one who exhibits good manners. Research has shown that physical punishment can exacerbate bad behaviour, as children become fearful of their learning environment and resentful towards their teachers. In some cases, such as in South Africa, learners have been known to become disrespectful towards their teachers due to the strained relationships caused by corporal punishment. While some may argue that corporal punishment can lead to positive behaviour changes, these instances are rare and do not outweigh the potential harm caused by physical punishment.In conclusion, I firmly believe that corporal punishment has no place in schools and is unlikely to produce the desired behavioural changes in children. Instead, teaching learners good manners and values is a more effective and humane approach, as it promotes positive behaviour without the risk of exacerbating undesirable behaviour. By adopting this approach, we can create a more supportive and conducive learning environment, where children feel valued, respected, and encouraged to develop into well-mannered and responsible individuals.
623;The use of social media is replacing face-to-face interaction among many people in society. Do you think the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?;The modern world of social interaction changed completely over the past decades. Now many of us spent much more time interracting through social media, messengers for private or corporate messaging. We also use video conference and sharing our workflow remotely.As for me we have different needs satisfied by communication formed by different systems in our brain. On the one hand we have we communicate with each other aiming to get a useful information. On the other hand communication gives some non-verbal part like a sense of neing involved into one process, belonging to a circle of friends, collegues or family. These two sides of the process of communication are implemented differently that's why each part gets its own advantages and disadvantages thanks to changing integrating new social network technologies.If to talk about an information exchange - as for it became much more efficient with using messages, cloud storages and different coworking tools. But it is true only for those people who use these technology well. As far as I can see many advantages in remote work such as possibility not to waste time for commuting, offices and separate equipment, many people notice that their remote collegues disapperar often and avoid their duties. Some people couldn't concentrate while working at home. As for me people who experince such a problems are just addicted to strong stimules such as face-to face interraction and being managed by their boss. At the same time different internet based tools allow you to share much more information much faster and forever. Now you cannot just forget you task because you can always revise it in your work messenger and cloud folder wherever and whenever you are.One another need - is to have a social interraction. Of course ssocial network give us some advantage even in this area - now we can keep our relationships with more people across longer distances. While moving to another city or country we do not feel isolation so much anymore. It allows us to mentain or ralationships longer and stronger. At the same time such an option give people a possibility to avoid face-to-face communication with people phisically close to them. As for me it gives only one disadvantage - it is getting harder to load some parts of our brain which are evolutionary oriented to face-to-face interraction.I can conclude that social media interraction gave us some new possibilities and cut off some of the old ones. At the same time modern technologies blur boundaries between a real conversation and internet communication. Now we can perfectly see and hear each-other and even support financially. There are also some devises wich allow you to feel even more - like touches or heartrythm of each other. I think that new social media tools and some next directions of these tools will satisfy our face-to-face communication needs more and more over time.;The modern world of social interaction has undergone a significant transformation over the past few decades. With the rise of social media, messengers, and video conferencing, many of us now spend a substantial amount of time interacting with others through digital means, both personally and professionally. Remote work has also become increasingly prevalent, with the use of workflow sharing and collaboration tools.From a psychological perspective, human communication serves two primary purposes. On one hand, we communicate to exchange useful information, and on the other hand, we communicate to fulfill our non-verbal needs, such as feeling involved, belonging to a social circle, and maintaining relationships with friends, colleagues, and family. These two aspects of communication are implemented differently, resulting in unique advantages and disadvantages, particularly with the integration of new social network technologies.In terms of information exchange, digital communication has become much more efficient, thanks to messaging, cloud storage, and collaboration tools. However, this efficiency is only beneficial for those who are proficient in using these technologies. While remote work offers advantages such as reduced commuting time and increased flexibility, some individuals struggle with the lack of face-to-face interaction and supervision, leading to difficulties in concentration and a tendency to avoid responsibilities. In my opinion, these challenges arise from a strong dependence on in-person interaction and managerial guidance.On the other hand, digital tools enable rapid and perpetual information sharing, making it easier to stay on top of tasks and responsibilities. With the ability to access work messengers and cloud folders at any time and from any location, it has become increasingly difficult to forget or neglect tasks.Another fundamental human need is social interaction. Social networks have provided advantages in this area as well, enabling us to maintain relationships with a larger number of people across greater distances. This has reduced the feeling of isolation when moving to a new city or country, allowing us to sustain and strengthen relationships over time. However, this has also led to a tendency to avoid in-person communication with those in close physical proximity. In my view, this results in the underutilization of certain brain functions that are evolutionarily adapted for face-to-face interaction, leading to a single notable disadvantage.In conclusion, social media interaction has introduced new possibilities while also limiting some traditional ones. Modern technologies have blurred the lines between real conversations and internet communication, enabling us to see, hear, and even financially support each other. Emerging devices are being developed to simulate touch and other sensory experiences, further bridging the gap between digital and in-person interaction. I believe that future social media tools and technologies will increasingly satisfy our
76;The world health organization recommends that people should eat five or more portion of fruit and vegetables per day. The bar chart shows the percentage of males and females in the UK by age group in 2006.You should write at least 150 words.;This bar chart depicts the percentage between male and female to eat five or above portion of fruit and vegetables per day in the UK. It is clear from the graph that the female is higher than male of percentage.According to what is shown, gradually increased from 19 to 34 ages same that from 35 to 54 ages. Between 55 and 64 ages is siginficant increased about between 19 and 24 ages, After that gradually decreased between 65 and 74. Although, Supposed to 25 and 34 ages, They the more consum but between 55 and 64 ages they is consum the highest. Also, The 75 age is the same percentage, unlike the all under 75 ages.To sum up, we could say that, the all ages is not equal between male and female in same percentage ages, except 75 age, They slight by 25 per cent between unisex. On other hand, Female and male is equal consume in 75 age.;This bar chart illustrates the percentage of males and females in the UK who consume five or more portions of fruit and vegetables per day. It is evident from the graph that females have a higher percentage than males.According to the data, the percentage increases gradually from the 19-24 age group to the 25-34 age group, and again from the 35-54 age group. However, there is a significant increase in the 55-64 age group compared to the 19-24 age group. After that, the percentage decreases gradually from the 65-74 age group. Interestingly, although the 25-34 age group has a higher consumption rate, the 55-64 age group has the highest consumption rate. Additionally, the 75 and over age group has the same percentage for both males and females, unlike the other age groups.In summary, the data suggests that the consumption rates are not equal between males and females across all age groups, except for the 75 and over age group, where they are roughly equal, with a slight difference of 25% in the younger age groups. On the other hand, males and females have equal consumption rates at 75 years and older.
1426;The world is experiencing a dramatic increase in population, which is causing problems not only for poor, undeveloped countries, but also for industrialized and developed nations. Describe some of the problems that overpopulation causes, and suggest at least one possible solution.;You should write at least 250 words.You should spend about 40 minutes on this task.Nowadays, the population dramatically in most countries around the world. This is true for the developed and developing nations. Overpopulation a different number of problems. However, the government can these problems in many .There are several problems that the raising number of people in undeveloped countries causes. Firstly, it is very difficult to provide enough food for all people. Secondly, the government limits the number of children per family in school. In addition, in poorest countries usually have , and when the population increases, the number of . Finally, when too many people live on the land, the environment suffers.There are different problems that overpopulation causes in rich nations. Firstly, it is very difficult for governments to provide helpful public services in overcrowded cities. Moreover, there is generally a higher level of crimes being committed, such as drugs abuse, murders, thefts, . often cause by the high rates of unemployment.However, overpopulation problems in nations have two main which they are by governments. Firstly, the government must educate people about limiting the size of the family. For example, in China they have a policy called “one child policy” which limits the size of the family to one or two children, and this is beginning to have an effect on the world’s most crowded nation.To sum up, if the impulsive population increase continues, many more people will die of hunger in the poor countries. Also, in rich nations, the life in the cities will become more and more difficult.;"The world is grappling with a significant challenge: the dramatic increase in population across most countries. This phenomenon affects both developed and developing nations, leading to a multitude of problems. However, governments can mitigate these issues through effective strategies. The rising number of people in underdeveloped countries poses several challenges. Firstly, providing sufficient food for everyone becomes a daunting task. Secondly, governments often limit the number of children per family, which can impact school enrollment. Additionally, in the poorest countries, limited resources are further strained when the population grows, exacerbating issues such as hunger and poverty. Lastly, overpopulation leads to environmental degradation, as the increased strain on the land takes a toll on natural resources.In contrast, overpopulation in rich nations presents different problems. Governments struggle to provide adequate public services in overcrowded cities, leading to decreased quality of life. Moreover, higher crime rates, including drug abuse, murder, and theft, are often linked to high unemployment rates. To address these issues, governments have two primary strategies. Firstly, educating the public about family planning is crucial. For instance, China's ""one child policy"" has begun to show positive effects in the world's most populous nation. By limiting family size, this policy aims to reduce the strain on resources and alleviate poverty.In conclusion, if the rapid population growth continues unchecked, the consequences will be severe. In poor countries, many more people will succumb to hunger and related issues. In rich nations, city life will become increasingly difficult, with decreased access to public services and a rise in crime. It is imperative for governments to implement effective measures to manage population growth and ensure a sustainable future for all. By investing in education and family planning, nations can mitigate the adverse effects of overpopulation and create a better world for generations to come."
1313;There are many things that can motivate people to perform well in their work. These can include the salary, job satisfaction or the chance to help others. What do you feel is the best motivation to do well at work?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;"To perform well in a job, people have to be motivated. There are multiple strategies for employers to incentivise their employees. The most obvious one is the salary; however, job satisfaction and the ability to help people are other methods of improving performance at work.For the majority of the people, receiving their salary at the end of the month is their motivation. This is because money is necessary to fulfill the most basic needs and other materialistic desires. Employees see these opportunities when receiving their salary and therefore work to achieve money. Furthermore, performing well in a job can often lead to promotions with higher pay packages. To receive this, staff have to stand out positively in their jobs. Salary is therefore a key motivational tool for many workforce participants.However, money is far from being the only incentive. Another aspect affecting performance is job satisfaction. If a person is comfortable in their work, they are more likely to perform well. Therefore this motivational tool interlinks with salary, as when people are content and perform well, the chances of promotion increase. For some individuals though, only their passion can drive them. Prime examples for this are humanitarian jobs. The salaries are often not very high, but those choosing to work in this field are often very driven; their passion to help others is prioritised over their own salary.In conclusion, while income might be the most common motivational factor, it is unusual to be the sole incentive for working hard, and some people are motivated wholly due to other reasons.";To excel in their profession, individuals need to be motivated. Employers can utilize various strategies to motivate their staff. While salary is the most apparent motivator, job satisfaction and the opportunity to make a positive impact on people's lives are also effective methods for enhancing work performance. For most people, receiving a salary is a primary motivator, as it enables them to fulfill their basic needs and material desires. The prospect of earning a salary drives employees to work hard, with the added incentive of potential promotions and higher pay packages for outstanding performance. As a result, salary is a crucial motivator for many employees. However, financial compensation is not the only driving force behind job performance. Job satisfaction also plays a significant role, as individuals who feel comfortable and content in their work environment are more likely to perform well. This, in turn, increases their chances of promotion, creating a link between job satisfaction and salary. Nevertheless, some individuals are driven by their passion and dedication to their work, rather than financial gain. Humanitarian jobs are a prime example of this, where salaries may be modest, but the desire to help others takes precedence over personal financial gain.In summary, while salary is often the primary motivator, it is rare for it to be the sole driving force behind hard work. Other factors, such as job satisfaction and personal passion, can also be powerful motivators, and for some, may even surpass financial incentives as the primary reason for their dedication and hard work.
1284;There is a moral necessity today for the richer countries of the world to help the poorer countries develop in terms of feeding the population, education and health care. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;The world today is often divided into two categories, more developed and less developed countries. This division is significant in terms of health, wealth and education. To minimise this gap, it is argued that richer countries are morally responsible to support the less wealthy. I, personally, feel that the prosperous countries are obligated and expected to to contribute to the development of countries with weaker economies.To address this argument, the history of the wealthy countries is relevant. Many less developed countries are former colonies, therefore the wealthy countries had a historical impact on the less wealthy. Thus, richer countries’ economies were dependent on the currently less developed countries for their rich status. Furthermore, even today the wealthy countries contribute to the wealth inequality by exploiting the inhabitants of less developed countries, giving workers lower wages than people within their own countries. Due to this dependence on poorer countries and the influence that the richer countries have had on the imbalance, it can be concluded that richer countries are indeed morally obliged to help the less wealthy countries.Opposing this is the view that each country is in charge of their own inhabitants and that therefore they need to provide health, education and basic necessities for themselves. In addition, simply providing these three services would not lead to closing the wealth gap. It would rather be helpful to invest sustainably in poorer countries and help them create their own systems, allowing these countries to be self-sufficient.In conclusion, while there is a moral necessity for wealthy countries to aid the poorer ones, simply providing basic necessities is not sufficient. A more sustainable idea would be to teach countries to plan and provide for themselves by giving economic incentives.;The world is often segmented into two distinct categories: more developed and less developed countries. This dichotomy is particularly pronounced in terms of health, wealth, and education. To bridge this gap, it is commonly argued that affluent nations have a moral obligation to support less wealthy ones. Personally, I believe that prosperous countries are duty-bound to contribute to the development of nations with weaker economies.To address this argument, it is essential to consider the historical context of wealthy countries. Many less developed countries are former colonies, and as such, wealthy nations had a significant historical impact on their less affluent counterparts. In fact, the economies of richer countries were often built on the backs of currently less developed countries, which contributed to their affluent status. Moreover, wealthy countries continue to perpetuate wealth inequality by exploiting inhabitants of less developed countries, paying them lower wages than their own citizens. Given this historical dependence on poorer countries and the influence wealthy nations have had on the existing imbalance, it can be concluded that richer countries are indeed morally obligated to assist less wealthy ones.However, there is an opposing view that each country is responsible for the well-being of its own citizens, and therefore, should provide health, education, and basic necessities without external assistance. Moreover, merely providing these essential services would not suffice to close the wealth gap. Instead, it would be more beneficial to invest sustainably in poorer countries, helping them establish their own systems and become self-sufficient.In conclusion, while there is a moral imperative for wealthy countries to aid poorer ones, simply providing basic necessities is not enough. A more viable approach would be to empower countries to plan and provide for themselves by offering economic incentives, thereby fostering sustainable development and self-sufficiency.
1217;There is growing evidence that man-made activities are making global temperatures higher.What might be the man-made causes of temperatures rising? How should we deal with this problem?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In the last years the problem of global warming is becaming more and more debated. One of the main causes of the temperature rising are men-made activities. Almost all the activities made by humans produce a huge impact on the natural environment. For instance, some of the usual activities made daily by people are impacting. Indeed, the chemical products they buy and use as well as the ways of trasportation's abuse can be annoverated among the main reasons for global warming. Lastly, even if it is the more impacting, there is the industral system and their production of slags.The first impact made by men-activities concerns the product they use. There are at least three kinds of products that may cause the rising of temperature. First, there are products like lacquaer and foam. Because they were beed uncontrolled used during the last decades, they have been one of the main causes of the Ozone Hole. Spray products, even if they are just suncream or hair conditionars could be very impacting because of their chemical composition. Another men-activity that impact a lot on the environment concern their use of the way of transportation. Indeed, the abuse of private ways of trasportation caused an increasement of pollution and a dramatic increase of the level of petrol in the environment. Petrol is not only one of the main reason for global warming but also the first responsible for sea's pollution. Furthermore, the dayly use of flight cause pollution in the air and now restriction on the abuse of this way of trasportation are trying to be a kind of solution to the problem.Lastly, one of the main causes of global temperatures higher is the industrial system. Indeed, they used to point to the cheaper solution to produce and eliminate the radioactive waste. The problem of a prodaction that does not take care of the environment pointed to use polluting products and machines. Furthermore, the industrial system point to produce more and more causing the waste of energy and raw materials. For instance, the fashion industry is one of the more pulluting in the world. It abuses of materials and energies whithout caring abuut the waste of them. Finally, the problem of the way in which the industries procede in elimnating waste is crucial. Indeed, in the last years they used to disperse the waste on the sea. This tendecy was increased for two reasosns: saving and speed. These are the two eassential words of industrial system.In conclusion, I think there are two main reasons that cause the raising of global temperatures that can be annoverated among the others. Those that concern the personal and daily activities of men (use of determinate products and ways of trasportation) and then those activities operate by the industrial system.;In recent years, the issue of global warming has become increasingly debated. One of the primary causes of rising temperatures is human activity. Almost all human activities have a significant impact on the natural environment. For example, daily activities such as the use of chemical products and transportation methods are contributing to the problem. Additionally, the industrial system and its production of waste are also major contributors to global warming.The first impact of human activities is related to the products they use. There are at least three types of products that can cause temperature rises. Firstly, products like lacquer and foam have been used excessively over the past few decades, contributing to the depletion of the ozone layer. Even seemingly harmless products like sunscreen and hair conditioners can have a significant impact due to their chemical composition. Another human activity that has a significant environmental impact is the use of transportation. The excessive use of private vehicles has led to an increase in pollution and a dramatic rise in petrol levels in the environment. Petrol is not only a major contributor to global warming but also a primary cause of sea pollution. Furthermore, the daily use of air travel causes air pollution, and restrictions on the excessive use of this mode of transportation are being implemented as a solution to the problem.Lastly, one of the main causes of rising global temperatures is the industrial system. Industries often prioritize cheaper production methods, which can lead to environmental degradation. The production process often involves the use of polluting products and machines, and the focus on producing more and more goods results in the waste of energy and raw materials. For instance, the fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries in the world, with excessive use of materials and energy without regard for waste management. Finally, the problem of waste disposal is crucial, as industries have historically disposed of waste in the oceans, driven by the need for speed and cost savings.In conclusion, I believe there are two main reasons for the rise in global temperatures: personal and daily human activities, such as the use of certain products and transportation methods, and activities operated by the industrial system. These two factors are major contributors to the problem of global warming, and addressing them is essential to mitigating its effects.
1427;There is no longer enough natural resources to sustain current levels of economic growth. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?;Recently, the natural resources risen dramatically across the world due to population growth. Some people state that we enough resources. However, there are some individuals who disagree with this opinion. In this essay, the issues behind this phenomenon will be examined.On the one hand, some people state that if will continue to we cannot have a comfortable life because natural resources are limited. According to a if this situation will continue, the petrol will in 2050. Moreover, it is widely said that the will increase. This will make the amount of natural .On the other hand, there are some individuals who disagree with above-mentioned perception. The natural resources will technology. For example, the of technology such as cars a positive impact the society. By using this, we can the consumption of natural resources. Eventually, we will not need natural fuel. In my opinion, of natural is , I think the loss of it a negative impact the society because won’t have a comfortable life any more.In conclusion, I agree with the idea that there is no longer enough natural resources to sustain this situation. In order to our life, the governments countries should tackle this issue.;Recently, the demand for natural resources has increased dramatically worldwide due to population growth. While some people argue that we have sufficient resources, others disagree. This essay will examine the issues surrounding this phenomenon.On the one hand, some individuals argue that if we continue to consume natural resources at the current rate, we will not be able to maintain a comfortable standard of living. According to some estimates, if this trend continues, petrol reserves will be depleted by 2050. Furthermore, it is widely predicted that the global population will increase, leading to a surge in demand for natural resources.On the other hand, there are those who disagree with this perspective. They argue that advancements in technology will help mitigate the depletion of natural resources. For instance, the development of alternative technologies, such as electric cars, can have a positive impact on society. By utilizing such technologies, we can reduce our consumption of natural resources. Ultimately, this could lead to a scenario where we no longer rely on natural fuels. In my opinion, the depletion of natural resources is a significant concern, as I believe that losing access to these resources will have a negative impact on society, making it difficult to maintain a comfortable standard of living.In conclusion, I agree with the notion that there are no longer sufficient natural resources to sustain the current situation. To ensure a sustainable future, governments and countries must address this issue and work towards finding solutions to conserve and manage natural resources effectively.
1324;These days, many young people are not spending their weekends and holidays doing outdoor activities such as hiking or mountaineering. Why is that happening? How can they be encouraged to spend more time in the natural environment?;Nowadays, the younger generation tends to avoid recreational activities such as hiking or alpinism. It seems that young people prefer to spend their weekends indoors, gaming or engaging in other online activities. If that is the case, by promoting sports more actively and organising sports competitions, the schools could counteract this trend.Living in the era of technology, the wide availability and variety of online entertainment are compelling young people to spend a lot of their free time indoors, using their gadgets. Numerous relatively cheap forms of amusement, such as online games, videos, audiobooks and plenty of other activities, tempt teenagers to stay at home and lead more sedentary lifestyles. A recent survey revealed that the vast majority of students would prefer spending their weekends playing computer games, rather than in the nature. That is one clear reason why our modern youth is less interested in recreational sports.To address this issue, the school management could intervene and offer a better range of outdoor sports activities and competitions, both within the school curriculum and as extra-curricular activities. For example, high schools could increase the number of weekly football, running and climbing classes, and organise competitions at the end of each term. As a result, pushed by their desire to win, students would do more walking, jogging, running and mountaineering during the school term, in preparation for the competition. This would reduce the time spent online, lessen the students’ dependence on the Internet for entertainment, and eventually boost their desire to spend more time enjoying the natural environment.To sum up, screen addiction plays a major role in young people’s avoidance of various outdoor activities. Opening up more recreational sports and offering frequent competitions on school grounds is a great way to motivate more students to spend their leisure time in the nature.;In today's digital age, it's becoming increasingly common for the younger generation to shy away from outdoor activities like hiking and mountain climbing. Instead, many young people seem to prefer spending their free time indoors, engaged in online gaming and other digital pursuits. To counter this trend, schools could play a crucial role by actively promoting sports and organizing competitions, which could encourage students to explore outdoor activities. The widespread availability of online entertainment, including cheap and accessible forms of amusement such as video games, videos, audiobooks, and more, is drawing teenagers indoors, leading to more sedentary lifestyles. A recent survey highlighted that a significant majority of students would rather spend their weekends playing computer games than engaging with nature. This preference for digital entertainment over outdoor activities is a clear indicator of why the modern youth is less enthusiastic about recreational sports.To tackle this issue, school administrations could step in by offering a broader range of outdoor sports activities and competitions, both as part of the curriculum and as extracurricular activities. For instance, high schools could increase the frequency of football, running, and climbing classes and organize term-end competitions. Driven by the competitive spirit, students would likely engage more in physical activities like walking, jogging, running, and mountain climbing in preparation for these competitions. This approach would not only reduce the time spent on digital screens but also lessen the dependency on the internet for leisure and, over time, foster a greater appreciation for spending time in natural environments.In summary, the addiction to screens significantly contributes to young people's avoidance of outdoor activities. By introducing more recreational sports options and hosting frequent competitions on school grounds, schools can motivate students to spend their leisure time outdoors, fostering a healthier balance between digital entertainment and natural exploration.
919;To be labelled a ‘Work of Art’, a painting, sculpture or other art form should display certain qualities that are unique. However, over the past century there has been a decline in the quality of prize-winning artwork and it is now possible for quite ordinary pieces of art to be labelled ‘masterpieces ’ whilst true works of art pass unnoticed.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;For centuries, artworks have been titled  'Work of Art' based on their extraordinary qualities. However, some people argue that nowadays, the standards are decreasing and the labelling of substandard artworks as 'masterpieces' has become ubiquitous. The upcoming essay will discuss why I agree that original paintings are being neglected while usual ones are being praised.Firstly, the superficial nature of humans is responsible for this change. These days, people do not see the meaning behind the painting or the message the artist is trying to convey rather they buy those paintings which are popular and contemporary. To illustrate it further, in art auctions it can be seen that when one person bids on one painting, no matter whether it is good or bad, others also start putting their money on it. Thus it is clear that normal art forms are winning prizes due to public attention.Secondly, some artists might bribe the organizers of exhibitions to promote their canvas. Indeed, there have been some recorded instances when artists were caught while signing up deals to increase the sales of their work. If a certain artwork receives publicity then it is impossible that it would not have an influence on the public. This type of promotion skews a person's opinion about a certain picture and so are forced to think about purchasing it, leaving behind original ones. Therefore, it is apparent that the diabolical activities of painters are responsible for their works being labelled as masterpieces.To conclude, the maintenance of social position and influence of painters are the prime causes for the popularity of ordinary artworks and the negligence of true works. Hence I agree with the given statement.;"For centuries, exceptional artworks have been distinguished as ""Works of Art"" due to their remarkable qualities. However, a growing concern is that the standards for evaluating art are declining, and the practice of labeling mediocre artworks as ""masterpieces"" has become widespread. This essay will argue in favor of the notion that original paintings are being overlooked, while more conventional ones are receiving undue praise.The primary reason for this shift is the superficial nature of human beings. Nowadays, people tend to focus on the popularity and contemporary appeal of a painting, rather than its underlying meaning or the message the artist intends to convey. This phenomenon is evident in art auctions, where the bidding process often becomes a self-reinforcing cycle, with people bidding on a painting simply because others are doing so, regardless of its actual quality. As a result, ordinary art forms are receiving accolades and prizes due to their ability to capture public attention.Furthermore, some artists may engage in unethical practices, such as bribing exhibition organizers to promote their work. There have been documented cases of artists being caught making deals to artificially inflate the sales and reputation of their art. When an artwork receives significant publicity, it inevitably influences public opinion, causing people to consider purchasing it over more original and deserving pieces. This type of promotion distorts the viewer's perception, leading them to overlook genuinely exceptional works in favor of more heavily promoted ones. Therefore, it is clear that the unscrupulous actions of some artists are contributing to the misattribution of their works as masterpieces.In conclusion, the desire to maintain social standing and influence among artists is a primary driver of the popularity of ordinary artworks, while genuine masterpieces are being neglected. I firmly agree with the statement that original paintings are being overlooked in favor of more conventional, yet less deserving, works."
1338;Today children are spending much more time watching TV compared to the past. Why do you think this happens? Is this a positive or a negative change?;"A trend has emerged in the last two decades with youngsters watching more TV than ever before. One of the main reasons behind this issue is the recent advancements in technology in gaming and film industries. This tendency has both pros and cons, and will be further discussed in this essay.The latest developments in video game consoles attracted both children and adults to spend extra time watching TV, compared to the past. With interactive gaming characters and high quality graphics, children are more likely to spend long hours playing games in front of the TV. A recent survey showed that TV addiction among young people, for example, has significantly increased from 5% to 80%, which was supposedly caused by the introduction of advanced gaming consoles. This increase is also partially due to films, drama series and cartoons being easily available on pirated websites and various gaming platforms.This trend has had more negative than positive effects on young citizens. More time spent watching TV adversely affects the mental and physical wellbeing of a child. For instance, the obesity ratio among young individuals in the past 10 years has risen dramatically; this has caused further health problems such as anxiety and depression. However, TV can also be used in a positive way. It is a great source of information that can help youngsters increase their knowledge and succeed in their future careers.In conclusion, recent breakthroughs in technology are driving up the amount of time our youngsters are spending in front of their TV screens. This can do more harm than good if we don’t regulate the use of TV, but parents have the power to make TV time useful and beneficial for their children.";Over the past two decades, a notable trend has emerged among young people, with a significant increase in TV watching habits. The primary driver behind this phenomenon is the rapid advancements in technology, particularly in the gaming and film industries. This shift has both advantages and disadvantages, which will be explored in depth throughout this essay.The latest innovations in video game consoles have drawn in both children and adults, leading to extended periods of TV watching compared to previous years. The interactive nature of gaming characters and high-definition graphics have made it more appealing for children to spend extensive hours engaged in gaming activities in front of the screen. A recent survey highlighted a substantial increase in TV addiction among young individuals, rising from 5% to 80%, largely attributed to the introduction of sophisticated gaming consoles. Furthermore, the easy accessibility of films, drama series, and cartoons on pirated websites and various gaming platforms has also contributed to this uptrend.However, this trend has had a more profound negative impact on young citizens than positive. Excessive TV watching has detrimental effects on the mental and physical health of children. For instance, over the past decade, the obesity rate among young individuals has increased dramatically, leading to additional health issues such as anxiety and depression. On the other hand, TV can also serve as a valuable resource. It is a rich source of information that can assist youngsters in expanding their knowledge and achieving success in their future careers.In conclusion, technological advancements are contributing to the rising amount of time youngsters spend watching TV. If left unregulated, this could lead to more harm than benefit. Nonetheless, parents possess the authority to transform TV time into a useful and beneficial experience for their children, emphasizing the importance of responsible TV consumption and guidance.
603;Today family members do not eat meals together. Why does this happen? Is this a positive or negative developmentGive reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Dinner tables are no longer a place for family reunion in today's society. Reasons from many aspects account for this phenomenon which pose a huge threat to the happiness of family and the harmony of society.Causes vary from person to person. Some people, especially the young believing that conflicts are common on dinner tables, tend to have meals with their friends rather than their family members. But most people are deprived of their rights by the development of society. Too busy to get home at dinner time, people have to eat meals near workplace. Also, with the job diversity increasing, rarely can family members with different timetables eat meals at the same period. For instance, a bank agent getting home at 6 pm tends to miss her doctor husband leaving home at 5 pm for emergency work.It is the advantages of sharing meals with family that attach great importance to this event. Time for communication is so critical that families lacking such opportunities are often full of misunderstandings and quarrels. Not only can this development increase the divorce rate but it may also decrease the marriage rate. Because support and care from family, the previous harbor, is deprived and people see no significance from getting married. With such phenomenon prevailing, the negative emotions may take advantage in the society. Loneliness, distress and helplessness stike those always eating alone.In a nutshell, taking the damage to both families and societies into consideration, various solutions should be put forward to the roots behind the situation.;In today's society, the dinner table has lost its traditional role as a hub for family gatherings. This phenomenon, driven by multiple factors, poses a significant threat to family happiness and social harmony. The causes of this trend vary, with some individuals, particularly the young, opting to dine with friends instead of family members due to the prevalence of conflicts at the dinner table. However, for many people, the demands of modern society have led to a loss of quality time with family.The increasingly fast-paced and demanding nature of work leaves many individuals with no choice but to eat near their workplaces, missing out on dinner with their family. Furthermore, the diversity of work schedules makes it challenging for family members to find a common time to share meals. For example, a bank employee who returns home at 6 pm may often miss dinner with their doctor spouse who leaves for emergency work at 5 pm. The importance of sharing meals with family cannot be overstated, as it provides crucial time for communication and bonding. Without such opportunities, families may find themselves plagued by misunderstandings and arguments, potentially leading to higher divorce rates and lower marriage rates, as the traditional support and care provided by family seems less significant.As this phenomenon becomes more widespread, negative emotions such as loneliness, distress, and helplessness may begin to dominate society, particularly affecting those who consistently dine alone. In conclusion, considering the harm this trend causes to both families and society, it is imperative to address the underlying issues and propose solutions to revive the tradition of family dinners and mitigate the adverse effects on individuals and communities.
883;Today, the high sales of popular consumer goods reflect the power of advertising and not the real needs of the society in which they are sold. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;There is no doubt that nowadays advertising plays a very strong role in saling goods. The high rate of sales does not always mean the real needs of some goods. In this essay, i will discuss both views and draw my personal conclusion.In terms of advertising's power in increasing sales of popular consumer goods, advertising has an essencial role these days in sales. The main reason given to support this claim is advertisnig attracts people and inform people about the new and special products in a very special way. To illustrate, using social media for marketing and advertising raise sales dramatecly. People spend most of their times to watch what is in the social media and that means social media is the best way to do your marketing.However, some people say that people buy these products not because they really need them but because they like the way that was used to advertise these products. On the other hand, some times people purchase goods because they have seen them or heard about them from others or from the social media not due to their needs of these products.In conclusion, I believe that increasing the sales of some popular consumer goods show how strong is advertising and how advertising plays a crucial role in saling products. Also, smart business owners should think about advertising as a fast way to sale their goods. As was previously menthond, people can be attracted by all kinds of advertising and that definitly lead to increasing the sale rate.;Undoubtedly, advertising has become a powerful tool in driving sales in today's market. However, a high sales rate does not necessarily indicate a genuine need for a particular product. In this essay, I will examine both perspectives and draw my own conclusion.On the one hand, advertising plays a vital role in boosting sales of popular consumer goods. Its primary function is to capture people's attention and inform them about new and special products in an engaging manner. For instance, leveraging social media for marketing and advertising has been shown to dramatically increase sales. As people spend a significant amount of time on social media, it has become an ideal platform for businesses to promote their products.On the other hand, some argue that consumers purchase products not because they genuinely need them, but because they are drawn to the creative advertising strategies used to promote them. Furthermore, people often buy products after seeing or hearing about them from others or on social media, rather than due to an actual need for the product.In conclusion, I firmly believe that the surge in sales of popular consumer goods demonstrates the significant impact of advertising on product sales. Moreover, savvy business owners should recognize the potential of advertising as a means to rapidly drive sales. As previously mentioned, people can be swayed by various forms of advertising, which inevitably leads to an increase in sales rates.
1328;Today’s young generation is facing many problems at school and at home. What are the problems? What can parents do to help their teenage children?;"Young people today are under a lot of pressure, which seems to come from many directions. The problems they are experiencing happen not only at school, but also at home, and it seems that without adult guidance, our young generation will continue to struggle.Teenage years have never been simple, and many would agree that the amount of challenges has only increased with the passage of time. Bullying has been a problem for quite a while, and children and adolescents would have experienced it at school in the past, but then it would stop at home. At present, however, things have been made worse by social media penetrating the supposedly safe space of our teenagers. The unfortunate behaviour of their peers can now reach them even in their bedrooms, causing them constant distress.Another issue troubling many young people is the pressure to succeed by their families. Whether at school or at home, they often feel as if they are not smart enough, which creates overwhelm and despair. Understandably, their parents are pursuing a worthy goal of ensuring their children get a great start in life; however, many teens feel that they are failing their families when they don’t live up to their expectations. This often leads to dishonest and unethical behaviour, such as cheating on tests or plagiarising other students’ work. When uncovered, these incidents have a profound effect on young people’s future careers, not to mention their emotional well-being.It is hard to underestimate the importance of parental support to navigating life as a young person. From helping teens build a positive body image and self-esteem, to handling classmates’ difficult behaviour, to guidance where study is concerned, parents can make a world of difference. Talking to their sons and daughters about matters that worry them, listening and making non-judgmental suggestions are great ways to help. Getting a professional involved where necessary and engaging with teachers, councilors and coaches is another opportunity for parents to provide assistance. Last but not least, parents can make their children better and happier people by simply giving them unconditional love.To sum up, being a young person in the modern world isn’t easy. By banding together and paying careful attention to their teens, families can help them overcome any obstacles to becoming successful adults.";The life of a young person today is filled with immense pressure, emanating from multiple sources. The challenges they face are not limited to the school environment, but also permeate their home life, and without guidance from adults, it appears that the struggles of the younger generation will persist. The teenage years have historically been complex, and many would concur that the number of obstacles has escalated over time. Bullying, a longstanding issue, was once confined to the school setting, but with the advent of social media, it has infiltrated the supposedly safe haven of teenagers' personal spaces, causing them relentless distress.Another significant concern for many young individuals is the pressure to excel, imposed by their families. Whether at school or at home, they often feel inadequate, leading to feelings of overwhelm and desperation. Understandably, parents strive to provide their children with a strong foundation for success, but many teenagers feel as though they are disappointing their families when they fail to meet expectations. This can lead to unethical behavior, such as cheating on exams or plagiarizing others' work, which can have profound consequences on their future careers and emotional well-being when discovered.The role of parental support in navigating the challenges of youth cannot be overstated. Parents can make a significant difference by helping their teenagers develop a positive self-image and self-esteem, coping with difficult peer behavior, and providing guidance on academic matters. Engaging in open conversations with their children, listening to their concerns, and offering non-judgmental advice are effective ways to provide support. Additionally, involving professionals when necessary, and collaborating with teachers, counselors, and coaches can further assist parents in providing guidance. Perhaps most importantly, parents can foster happier and more well-rounded individuals by offering unconditional love.In conclusion, navigating the modern world as a young person is fraught with challenges. However, by uniting and providing attentive support, families can empower their teenagers to overcome any obstacles and thrive as successful adults.
1310;Tourism today creates a variety of problems, such as pollution due to flights, transport and dirty water.Do you think that governments should impose extra taxes on flights or accommodation to restrict today’s tourism industry?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Travelling today is simple to the extent that within twelve hours one can travel from Europe to Singapore, crossing nearly the whole globe. Based on this simplicity, tourism has changed significantly over the years. While in the past a family would be proud to drive two hours to a lake, many families now think nothing of travelling to the far side of the world. This also has a downside as increased pollution is a result. Extra taxes on flights or accommodation have therefore been offered as a solution so as to increase the cost of tourism and reduce its popularity.No matter what major transportation is used, travelling creates pollution. To decrease the amount of pollution caused by tourism, the tourism industry itself would have to be weakened. If these increased taxes are based on travelling distance, people would be more willing to stay closer to their home country, as for many even a slight increase would mean that their planned holidays would be too expensive. Accommodation taxes would raise holiday costs no matter the distance travelled. Therefore, if increased taxes were levied on travel and accommodation, tourism and therefore pollution would decrease.On the other hand, the main transport methods that would be impacted by imposing extra taxes would be communal ones, such as planes, trains and buses, and increasing the taxes would also impact non-tourists. Also, holidays are a vital part of ordinary people’s lives, as they escape from work and stress, and get to spend valuable time with their families. Stopping people travelling would greatly impact some simple pleasures of ordinary life.In conclusion, while tourism impacts the environment significantly, simply introducing extra taxes on transport or accommodation is a drastic measure. It could be more valuable to change the methods of transportation to decrease pollution, instead making people stay close to home.;Traveling has become remarkably convenient, with the ability to traverse nearly the entire globe in just twelve hours, making it possible to travel from Europe to Singapore in a relatively short period. This ease of travel has led to a significant shift in the tourism landscape over the years. Whereas in the past, a family would consider a two-hour drive to a lake a notable achievement, many families now view traveling to the other side of the world as a commonplace activity. However, this increased travel has a downside, as it contributes to rising pollution levels. To mitigate this issue, proposals have been made to implement additional taxes on flights or accommodations, aiming to increase the cost of tourism and subsequently reduce its appeal.Regardless of the mode of transportation used, travel inherently generates pollution. To effectively decrease pollution caused by tourism, it would be necessary to reduce the scale of the tourism industry itself. Implementing distance-based taxes could encourage individuals to opt for closer-to-home destinations, as even a modest increase in costs could render planned holidays unaffordable for many. Taxes on accommodations, on the other hand, would increase holiday expenses regardless of the distance traveled, thereby potentially reducing tourism and the associated pollution.However, introducing extra taxes on travel and accommodations would disproportionately affect communal transportation methods like planes, trains, and buses, and would also impact non-tourists. Holidays play a vital role in the lives of ordinary people, providing an essential break from work and stress, and an opportunity to spend quality time with family. Curtailing travel would significantly impact the simple pleasures in life.In conclusion, while tourism does have a profound impact on the environment, introducing additional taxes on transport or accommodations might be an overly drastic measure. A potentially more effective approach could involve modifying transportation methods to decrease pollution, rather than compelling people to stay closer to home. This strategy could balance the need to protect the environment with the importance of maintaining accessible and affordable travel options for the public.
861;Traffic and housing problems could be solved by moving large companies, factories and their employees to the countryside.Do you agree or disagree?;Many metropolises are facing challenges, including traffic gams and serious lacking of housing available for families to live, particular in the developed countries. The governments are looking for a way to lessen the volume of traffic in the cities and to increase the number of housing provision over the metropolises. Some people advocate the businesses including large corporations and factories along with their employees moving to the suburbs which is the best way to figure out the metropolitan problems. Is this a sheer solution for these challenges faced by the cities?Economy boom in a country is accompanied with a number of problems incurred in the cities due to the multitudes living in there. It is no wonder that metropolises represent more job opportunities available and better education system to next generations. These are strong pull factors appealing people to stay in the cities despite the higher cost in living. A larger number of populations in the cities not only result in a severe shortage of housing where there is a higher demand of housing over the available supply, but also bring the higher volume of traffic across the cities, particular in a peak hour when a thousand and one employees commuting to work and students going to schools. Some people believe the working location shifting to rural areas is a solution that enables to lessen the frequent usage of roads in cities. Simultaneously, it is assumed that the housing issue can be solved naturally arising from the migration of their employees into the suburban town next to their working place.The business allocated to suburbs alone is rarely considered enough to tackle these problems. A place to live requires the basic facilities to serve for clothing, food, housing and transportation which are basic needs of human. If there is a working place and residential area only in the suburban town without any infrastructures, people have no choice to drive their vehicles back and forth between cities and their living places for the general consumption. As a consequence, the traffic congestion in cities will be worsen combining with the significant deterioration of air quality in the countryside due to an increase in the emission of the greenhouse gases. Therefore, the governments play a key role to establish a neighborhood which could be self-sufficient communities outside of their larger metropolitan areas. This may be a feasible and effective way to minimize the metropolitan issues.My own view is that the shifting strategies in suburbs can help lessen the challenges faced by metropolises. But the governments should take the smart planning into consideration in which the employment bases with the living infrastructures are developed in the suburban town.;Many cities are struggling with various challenges, including traffic congestion and a severe shortage of housing available to families, particularly in developed countries. Governments are seeking ways to reduce traffic volume in cities and increase housing provisions in metropolitan areas. Some people propose that businesses, including large corporations and factories, along with their employees, should relocate to the suburbs as a potential solution to these urban problems. But is this a viable solution to the challenges faced by cities?Economic growth in a country often leads to numerous problems in cities due to the large population. It's no surprise that cities offer more job opportunities and better education systems, making them attractive to people despite the higher cost of living. The large population in cities results in a severe housing shortage, with demand far exceeding supply, and also leads to increased traffic volume, particularly during peak hours when thousands of employees commute to work and students go to school. Some people believe that relocating workplaces to rural areas could help reduce the frequent use of roads in cities, and that the housing issue could be naturally resolved as employees migrate to suburban towns near their workplaces.However, relocating businesses to suburbs alone is rarely considered sufficient to address these problems. A livable place requires basic facilities such as food, clothing, housing, and transportation, which are fundamental human needs. If suburban towns lack infrastructure, people will have no choice but to drive back and forth between cities and their residences for basic necessities, exacerbating traffic congestion in cities and deteriorating air quality in the countryside due to increased greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, governments play a crucial role in establishing self-sufficient communities outside of larger metropolitan areas. This could be a feasible and effective way to mitigate urban issues.In my opinion, shifting strategies to suburbs can help alleviate the challenges faced by cities. Nevertheless, governments should prioritize smart planning, ensuring that employment bases are developed in conjunction with living infrastructure in suburban towns. This approach can help create sustainable and livable communities, ultimately reducing the problems plaguing metropolitan areas.
1229;Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;While some people argue that equal numbers of male and female students should be accepted in every major, I personally disagree with this statement.There are a number of arguments that can support my stance. To begin with, it is impossible to enroll equal genders of students in every subject. It is true that some faculties are underrepresented by a particular gender. For example, STEM subjects usually have more male students than females, but the opposite is true in educational-related subjects, which phenomenon seems to violate the principle that we fight endeavor today, gender equality. Therefore, people want to accept equal numbers of students to achieve a gender balance in every subject. However, the reality is that different genders prefer to study different subjects themselves, but not because of the unequal opportunity. According to one of the research, women show a higher interest in subjects like education, psychology and arts rather than science-related subjects. As a result, it is apparent that admitting equivalent proportions of male and female students can hardly be achieved.In addition, it will deprive students of chances to make their own choices if universities enroll both genders equally in every subject mandatorily. It should be noted that it is students' right to select the subjects freely in college. If students cannot register for the subjects they want to study just because there are not enough quotas left for particular gender of students, or they are forced to study some subjects they are not interested in just because they need to fulfill the gender requirement in the class, it will hinder students' learning in the long-run.To conclude, universities should not enroll equal gender students in every subject as it is impossible to achieve and may deprive students the freedom to choose the major they want to study.;I disagree with the notion that universities should aim to accept equal numbers of male and female students in every major. There are several reasons that support my position. Firstly, achieving equal gender representation in every subject is impractical. Certain fields, such as STEM subjects, tend to attract more male students, while educational-related subjects tend to have more female students. This phenomenon may seem to contradict the principle of gender equality, but it is largely driven by differing subject preferences among genders, rather than unequal opportunities.Research has shown that women tend to be more interested in subjects like education, psychology, and arts, whereas men tend to prefer science-related subjects. As a result, enforcing equal gender proportions in every subject is unlikely to be successful. Furthermore, mandating equal gender enrollment in every subject would restrict students' freedom to choose their own majors. Students have the right to select their subjects of interest in college, and forcing them to study something they are not interested in, or denying them admission to their preferred subject due to gender quotas, would ultimately hinder their learning experience.In conclusion, universities should not strive to enroll equal numbers of male and female students in every subject, as this goal is both unrealistic and potentially detrimental to students' academic freedom. Instead, institutions should focus on providing equal opportunities for all students, regardless of gender, to pursue their interests and passions without restriction.
1433;Universities should allocate the same amount of money to their sport activities as they allocate to their libraries. Do you agree or disagree?;Yes, I do feel that universities should have an equal budget for their libraries as well as sport activities. It is our general belief that a good player can not be good student and hence we restrict our children’s sport activities at college level. Moreover, an academic degree has much more value than sport activities which naturally compels students to focus more on their studies than their interest in sport.Most of the universities keep sports at of their priority list, good players do not get enough facilities and to improve their skills and eventually they their interest.Universities can play substantial role in shaping this upcoming talent by providing good trainers and which is otherwise too expensive to afford. Also it will attract other students sports and inculcate importance of physical fitness in them.Universities should produce in all fields rather than only concentrating on progress of scholars. Hence, I feel that universities should allot equal amounts of money to as well as sport activities.;I firmly believe that universities should allocate equal budgets to their libraries and sports activities. Unfortunately, there's a common misconception that a good player cannot be a good student, which leads parents to limit their children's participation in sports at the college level. Additionally, the perceived value of an academic degree often surpasses that of sports, causing students to prioritize their studies over their athletic interests.As a result, many universities tend to deprioritize sports, which means talented athletes lack access to adequate facilities and resources to hone their skills. This can lead to a decline in their interest and potential. However, universities are uniquely positioned to nurture emerging talent by providing top-notch trainers and facilities, which would otherwise be unaffordable for many students.By investing in sports, universities can also promote physical fitness and encourage other students to participate in athletic activities. Rather than solely focusing on academic achievements, universities should strive to produce well-rounded individuals who excel in all areas. Therefore, I strongly advocate for universities to allocate equal funding to both libraries and sports activities, recognizing the value of a balanced education that encompasses both academic and athletic pursuits.
1387;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;Today computers are used almost everywhere, it is impossible to imagine our life without PCs, Internet, mobile phones and other computer devices. It is reasonable to think that people look forward to the future of computers., computers make our life easier, we can easily get information about any product we plan to buy or place we plan to visit in a second using a personal computer and . Scientists predict that in the nearest future it will be possible to smell a new perfume using the Internet and watch 3D scenes at home like we do in the movie theater. According to forecasts of HR agencies machines will replace jobs of cashiers, and civil and military pilots. Some corporations in Japan are already sellinghousewife-robots, which help old people to keep their homes clean.Despite the fact that computers help us, they make us dependent. Apparently, people spend more time behind monitors than ever before. And some of them feel a need for more time to be spent with people in live contact. In addition, a breakdown of one of the important modules of a specific computer can entail serious consequences. to mention the computer problem that occurred in the end of 1990s, a problem related to the coming year 2000 (Y2K) and catastrophes that were predicted. Fortunately imminent disasters did not happen. However, it is difficult to imagine what could if all the predictions came true.We live in a technological era, computers penetrated everywhere with all benefits they provide and all dangers they hide. However we are satisfied with them and sometimes we even thank them because they help us in communicating, studying, doing business, entertaining and saving lives in critical situations.;"In today's world, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, making it impossible to envision a life without personal computers, the internet, mobile phones, and other digital devices. It's logical to assume that people are excited about the future of computing, as it continues to simplify our lives. With just a few clicks on a personal computer, we can instantly access information about products we're interested in buying or places we plan to visit. According to scientific predictions, the near future will bring even more astonishing advancements, such as the ability to smell new perfumes online and experience 3D scenes from the comfort of our own homes, similar to the immersive experience of a movie theater. Furthermore, forecasts from HR agencies suggest that automation will soon replace jobs like cashiers, and civil and military pilots. In Japan, some corporations are already marketing ""housewife-robots"" designed to assist elderly individuals in keeping their homes clean. While computers undoubtedly make our lives easier, they also create a sense of dependency. It's apparent that people are spending more time in front of screens than ever before, with some feeling the need for more face-to-face interaction. Additionally, the malfunction of a critical computer module can have severe consequences. The notorious computer problem that arose in the late 1990s, known as the Y2K bug, which predicted widespread catastrophes as the year 2000 approached, fortunately did not materialize into the anticipated disasters. However, it's daunting to consider what could have happened if all the predictions had come to pass. We are living in an era dominated by technology, where computers are omnipresent, bringing with them numerous benefits and hidden dangers. Nonetheless, we are generally satisfied with the role computers play in our lives, often expressing gratitude for how they facilitate communication, education, business, entertainment, and even save lives in critical situations."
1396;We are becoming increasingly dependent on computers. They are used in business, hospitals, crime detection and even to fly planes. What things will they be used for in the future? Is this dependence on computers a good thing or should we be more suspicious of their benefits?;In the last two decades cybernetics have experienced a major breakthrough .This led to the utilization of computers in nearly all parts of our daily life, from personal computers to the ones performing complicated surgeries. Surely the uptake of this technology facilitates a lot of difficult tasks but is this excessive ripping the warmth out of our lives? .Most of the daily tasks individual experiences are time and effort consuming. These two qualities could be tremendously saved by the use of computers. The average period required to prepare a decent meal for a middle-class family is around an hour to hour and a half when using traditional methods. This time could be literally reduced to half if computerized are used instead. Moreover, a busy businessman is enabled to easily close a profitable deal with just a touch highly programmed laptop while enjoying his family vacation and not having to exert an extra effort of traveling long distances in order to a deal.On the other hand, new generations are growing remarkably dependent on these modern utilities, which makes them handicapped when it comes to a cup of tea. , psychologists suggest that one of the main reasons for rate increase is the recent electric inventions. This is due to the fact that humans by nature stay emotionally healthy through socializing, but due to the importance of modern technology to maintain a financially satisfying standard of life they gradually themselves. As time passes by each of these individuals gets stuck in a vicious circle of loneliness that eventually leads to suicidal attempts especially among youngsters.In conclusion, similarly to every other invention computers have their benefits and drawbacks, I personally think it all depends upon how we use the given tools . Moderation is the key here to keep the balance and allow us to live in harmony.;Over the past two decades,Over the past two decades, the field of cybernetics has undergone a significant transformation, leading to the widespread adoption of computers in almost every aspect of our daily lives. From personal computers to complex surgical machines, technology has made its mark. While this has undoubtedly simplified many challenging tasks, it raises the question of whether our over-reliance on technology is stripping our lives of their warmth and human touch.Many everyday tasks are time-consuming and labor-intensive, but the use of computers can significantly reduce the time and effort required to complete them. For instance, preparing a meal for a middle-class family can take around an hour to an hour and a half using traditional methods, but this time can be halved with the use of computerized systems. Additionally, a busy businessman can now easily close a profitable deal with just a touch of a highly programmed laptop while on family vacation, eliminating the need for lengthy travels.However, there is a downside to this increasing dependence on technology. New generations are becoming remarkably reliant on these modern utilities, rendering them helpless in simple tasks, such as making a cup of tea. Psychologists suggest that the recent surge in depression rates can be attributed to the advent of modern technology, as humans are naturally inclined to maintain emotional well-being through social interaction. Nevertheless, the pressure to maintain a financially satisfying standard of living has led individuals to gradually isolate themselves, becoming stuck in a vicious cycle of loneliness that can ultimately lead to suicidal attempts, particularly among young people.In conclusion, like every other invention, computers have their advantages and disadvantages. Ultimately, it boils down to how we utilize the tools at our disposal. Moderation is essential to strike a balance and allow us to live in harmony with technology, rather than being controlled by it.
1356;What are the difficulties of learning a foreign language, and how to overcome them?;Many people believe that learning a foreign language is a very difficult task. What are the most difficult things about learning a foreign language? What is the best way to overcome them? Explain and include your personal experience or knowledge of these problems.It is true that acquiring new language skills is by no means an easy task. Language learners might encounter several challenges such as unfamiliar accents or grammar structures a foreign language. However, in my opinion, such difficulties can be tackled by a well-rounded education system.When it comes to languages, it is undeniably crucial to get used to a native accent and intonation for effective communication. However, picking up an accurate accent can be enormously difficult, especially for adult learners because of their lack of language learning ability. If a language learner has an unrecognisable accent and intonation, they would not be understood by native speakers. On top of that, each language has different grammar and typical grammatical sequencing of words. For example, Korean sentences always end with verbs whilst English not, which means that a Korean English-learner should the correct order of words.Despite the aforementioned difficulties, I strongly believe that everyone can master a foreign language when a couple of feasible steps are taken. Firstly, it is more important than anything to start learning a new language at a young age. By incorporating foreign language programmes in the primary school curriculum, children can easily be exposed to languages of the world and eventually acquire language skills without difficulties. Secondly, the government can financially subsidise schools to run student exchange programmes that help adolescents to get experiences abroad and make friends overseas while improving their foreign language in a way.In conclusion, I believe that individuals can have difficulties in learning a new language because of different accents and unfamiliar grammar, however, these problems can be overcome by a good quality of education system subsidised by governments.The writer covered the task by talking about some difficult aspects of learning a new language and steps to overcome them. The ideas are presented in an orderly way, their logical sequencing and the use of paragraphing make this essay easy to follow. Skillful use of linking words and expressions helps the writer maintain coherence and cohesion. Word choice needs some more attention in this essay (see suggested corrections for expressions underlined in blue), however, overall this essay seems to be worthy of IELTS Band 8.;"The notion that learning a foreign language is an arduous task is a widely-held belief among many individuals. The most significant challenges encountered by language learners include navigating unfamiliar accents and grammatical structures. However, in my opinion, these hurdles can be effectively overcome through a comprehensive education system.One of the most critical aspects of language acquisition is becoming accustomed to native accents and intonation patterns, which are essential for effective communication. Nevertheless, adopting an accurate accent can be an enormously daunting task, particularly for adult learners who may have diminished language learning capabilities. An unrecognizable accent and intonation can lead to misunderstandings with native speakers. Furthermore, each language possesses distinct grammatical structures and word sequencing, such as the verb placement in Korean sentences, which differs significantly from English.Despite these challenges, I firmly believe that mastering a foreign language is attainable when feasible steps are taken. Firstly, initiating language learning at a young age is crucial. By incorporating foreign language programs into primary school curricula, children can be effortlessly exposed to various languages and acquire language skills without encountering significant difficulties. Secondly, governments can provide financial subsidies to schools to facilitate student exchange programs, enabling adolescents to gain overseas experiences, forge friendships, and enhance their language skills in a practical setting.In conclusion, I believe that individuals may encounter difficulties in learning a new language due to accent and grammatical differences; however, these problems can be surmounted through a high-quality education system subsidized by governments.

1348;When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers (agree/disagree);When new towns are planned, it is important to build more public parks or sports facilities than shopping centers for people to spend their free time. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Sample EssaySome people argue that town planners should have a preference for more parks and gyms to be created than business districts and shopping malls. While I understand the concerns of people who hold this opinion, it seems to me that shopping centers are just as important as parks and gyms in a town.There are reasons why public facilities are crucial to city inhabitants. First of all, they provide suitable spaces and equipment for people to exercise. For example, people can go jogging in the park and play tennis or basketball at the sports stadium. That helps to keep their bodies fit and it also elevates their mood during the day. Besides, parks and sports facilities are good spots for people to socialize with their neighbors. People can connect with others when they are playing sports or talking casually with passers by in the park. A harmonious relationship between residents helps build a caring and friendly neighborhood.Although parks and gyms give the town dwellers all kinds of benefits, I would like to point out the importance of shopping malls to the district. Firstly, a shopping center could make shopping more convenient for the local residents. It would enable them to easily purchase things in town and transport them home with less effort and at lower cost. They would not need to spend extra money on transportation or shipping of the goods. Secondly, a shopping mall can provide employment. Locals can find work in retail, maintenance or security of the mall, hence earning an income to support their families.In conclusion, although parks and sports facilities serve as places for exercise and social activities for city dwellers, I believe that shopping centers are equally important, since they can provide job opportunities and convenience to the town residents.This essay would score well on Task Achievement because it addresses all parts of the question, discusses reasons for and against building more parks than shopping malls and expresses the opinion of the writer. The main ideas are organized well and explained coherently. The range of vocabulary is adequate for the requirements of the task response. Overall, this essay could get Band 8 in IELTS.;When designing new towns, it is essential to consider the allocation of public spaces. Some argue that town planners should prioritize the construction of public parks and sports facilities over shopping centers, as these provide residents with spaces to spend their free time. However, I partially disagree with this viewpoint, as I believe that shopping centers are equally important as parks and gyms in a town.There are several reasons why public facilities, such as parks and sports centers, are vital for city residents. Firstly, they provide suitable areas and equipment for physical exercise, enabling residents to maintain their physical health and mental well-being. For instance, individuals can jog in the park or engage in sports like tennis or basketball at the stadium. Additionally, these facilities foster socialization among neighbors, promoting a sense of community and friendship. When people interact with one another while engaging in sports or casual conversations, it helps build a harmonious relationship between residents, contributing to a caring and friendly neighborhood.Although public facilities offer numerous benefits to residents, I would like to highlight the significance of shopping malls in a town. Firstly, a shopping center can make shopping more convenient for local residents, enabling them to easily purchase goods and transport them home with minimal effort and expense. This eliminates the need for additional transportation costs or shipping fees. Secondly, shopping malls can provide employment opportunities for locals, who can work in retail, maintenance, or security, earning a living to support their families.In conclusion, while public parks and sports facilities serve as essential spaces for physical activity and socialization, I firmly believe that shopping centers are equally important, as they provide employment opportunities and convenience for town residents.

47;While many people go to university for academic study, more people should be encouraged to do vocational training because there is a lack of qualified workers such as electricians and plumbers. Do you agree or disagree?;Some believe that people should be encouraged more to study practical courses than going to university to fulfill the lack of workforce in practical areas. I agree with this proposal to some degree, because, from my knowledge, there is a lack in both fields, academic and vocational experts. Moreover, academic studies and vocational ones are equally important for every society, and not everybody can study the same thing, so both studies should be encouraged.Qualified workers and professional academics are equally needed in many parts of the world. This is because as the population grows the people's needs do it too, and this happens in all shapes and areas. While living in Argentina, I noticed the need of professionals in fields such as medicine and technology, especially robotics. In England, however, I observed the lack of plumers and carpenters. Consequently, every country needs different things.Furthermore, if strong encouragement is put on studying vocational courses only, this could be detrimental to the academic field. Essentially, both study systems are equally important. A hospital needs doctors to treat people as well as electricians to maintain the building. Besides, not everybody is good at everything. Some might be good at performing practical tasks and some good at thinking. In my family, I am the one who studied at the university, but my sister studied dressmaking. Both of us have jobs nowadays.In conclusion, I believe that the two types of studies should be stimulated. Countries worldwide are in lack of different experts, either in the vocational or academic field, hence, both workers are equally essential and needed. Besides and more importantly, not every individual can study the same subject or perform in the same area.;Some argue that individuals should be encouraged to pursue practical courses over university education in order to address the shortage of skilled workers in practical fields. I partially agree with this proposition, as I believe that there is a shortage of experts in both academic and vocational fields. In my opinion, both academic and vocational studies are equally vital for any society, and it's unrealistic to expect everyone to pursue the same path. Therefore, both types of studies should be promoted.The world needs a balance of qualified workers and professional academics, as the growing population leads to an increase in diverse needs. During my time in Argentina, I noticed a shortage of professionals in fields like medicine and technology, particularly robotics. In contrast, while living in England, I observed a lack of plumbers and carpenters. This highlights that each country has unique requirements.Moreover, if there is a strong emphasis on studying vocational courses exclusively, it could have a negative impact on the academic field. Essentially, both study systems are equally important. For instance, a hospital requires doctors to treat patients, as well as electricians to maintain the infrastructure. Additionally, people have different strengths and weaknesses, with some exceling in practical tasks and others in theoretical thinking. In my own family, I pursued university education, while my sister studied dressmaking, and we both have successful careers now.In conclusion, I firmly believe that both types of studies should be encouraged. Globally, countries are facing shortages of experts in various fields, whether vocational or academic. It's crucial to recognize that both types of workers are essential and needed. More importantly, individuals have different strengths and interests, and it's unrealistic to expect everyone to pursue the same subject or work in the same field.
1380;Why do criminals commit another offence after being punished?;"Many offenders commit more crimes after serving the first punishment. Why is this happening, and what measures can be taken to tackle this problem?It is true that some criminals commit crimes again after they have been punished. While there are several reasons for this alarming trend, some effective measures can be taken by governments to tackle this problem.There are two main reasons for re-offenders. Firstly, the prison system can make the situation worse. Criminals put together in prison and they make friends with other offenders. While they are locked up in prison, they do not have much to do there, and they would exchange information about what they have done before they came to the prison or they may plan crimes with other inmates. Secondly, offenders often do not have any other means of earning money. They are poor, uneducated and lacking skills needed to maintain a job. Also, a criminal record makes finding a job difficult as people usually avoid hiring .To solve this problem, governments should focus on rehabilitation of criminals rather than punishment. Above all, prisons need vocational training which inmates to prepare for life outside the prison. They can learn practical skills such as computer programming, car maintenance and graphic design. In this way, they can be hired for a position that requires this certain knowledge and skills. Community service is another way to reform offenders. Rather than being locked up in prison with other inmates, offenders can help society and become useful to their local community, and these activities would eliminate the negative influence that prisons can have.In conclusion, it is true the one of the problems our community; it can be solved by focusing rather than punishment itself.This is a good essay. The requirements of the task statement are covered, the reasoning is logical and presented in a coherent, easy to follow way, the range of vocabulary is wide enough and the writer shows fluency and flexibility. Some minor errors in this essay include word choice and preposition errors (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows suggested corrections). Overall this looks like an IELTS Band 8 essay.";It is a disturbing reality that many offenders go on to commit more crimes after serving their initial punishment. This raises important questions about the underlying causes of this trend and the measures that can be taken to address it.There are several reasons why some individuals reoffend after being punished. Two primary factors contribute to this phenomenon. Firstly, the prison system can exacerbate the problem. When criminals are incarcerated together, they often form friendships with other offenders, sharing information about their past crimes or planning new ones with fellow inmates. Secondly, many offenders lack alternative means of earning a living, struggling with poverty, limited education, and a lack of skills necessary to secure employment. Furthermore, a criminal record can make it difficult for them to find work, as employers often hesitate to hire individuals with a history of crime.To combat this issue, governments should prioritize the rehabilitation of offenders over punishment. Prisons should provide vocational training to prepare inmates for life outside, teaching practical skills such as computer programming, car maintenance, and graphic design. This would enable them to secure employment that utilizes their newly acquired knowledge and skills. Community service is another effective way to reform offenders, allowing them to contribute to society and become valuable members of their local community. Such activities would also mitigate the negative influences that prisons can have.In conclusion, the problem of reoffending is a significant concern for our community, but it can be resolved by focusing on rehabilitation rather than punishment alone. 
1400;With all the problems in the world today, spending money on space exploration is a complete waste. The money could be better spent on other causes.;, every day, every year, celebrates its achievements in space exploration. However, it is now the time to question how meaningful these blasts are.First, until all urgent and important matters of the globe have been solved, money on space exploration is meaningless. It at all to invest millions of dollars researching and producing foods for astronauts (for space exploration purpose), while every day thousands of people are starving. Furthermore, the discovery of outer space only serves a minor group of people if the majority well-educated. do no even know how to prevent common threatening diseases such as AIDS and lung cancer.Then, some may argue that the purpose of space exploration to discover new lands, new energy resources or to deter potential threat to . Nevertheless, is it effective to do so while other alternatives are available? yet effectively used. New energy resources (e.g. solar and nuclear energy) have not yet been widely-used. Threats of plagues have not yet been deterred. All of these tasks that haven’t been tackled yet require money. That is why costly space discovery programs are a waste of resources.In a nutshell, people should only invest in space exploration provided that urgent and important matters mentioned earlier in this essay have been solved. Also, purposes of space exploration campaigns should be studied carefully and other alternatives should be considered before the money is wasted.;Every year, the world celebrates its accomplishments in space exploration, marking a significant milestone in human achievement. Nevertheless, it's essential to reassess the value of these endeavors. The reality is that, until pressing global issues are resolved, investing in space exploration seems frivolous. It's illogical to allocate millions of dollars to research and develop food for astronauts when thousands of people suffer from hunger every day. Moreover, the discovery of outer space primarily benefits a small, educated minority, while the majority remains uninformed about preventing life-threatening diseases like AIDS and lung cancer.Proponents of space exploration may argue that its purpose is to discover new lands, energy resources, or to mitigate potential threats. However, is it prudent to pursue these goals when alternative solutions are available but underutilized? Renewable energy sources, as solar and nuclear power, have not been fully exploited. The menace of diseases remains unchecked. These unresolved issues require substantial funding, making costly space discovery programs a misallocation of resources.In conclusion, investment in space exploration should be contingent upon the resolution of pressing global issues. The objectives of space exploration initiatives must be meticulously evaluated, and alternative solutions should be considered before resources are squandered. It's crucial to prioritize the welfare of humanity and the planet before embarking on extravagant space ventures. By doing so, we can ensure that our resources are utilized effectively, addressing the most critical challenges facing our world today.
1312;With the increase in computer use, many people feel that schools do not need to put the emphasis that they used to on basic handwriting skills or mental mathematics skills.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;In recent years, computer use around the world has increased drastically. As a result technological equipment is used increasingly in schools around the world. Many people question therefore whether schools should put much emphasis on teaching students basic handwriting skills and mental mathematics skills.The use of technological equipment in lessons has increased since the onset of the digital age. Nearly all professions around the world involve computer use and even the simplest tasks are carried out via electronic equipment. Hence, it is important for students to learn how to use technology correctly for their future careers. Electronic devices also offer various learning advantages, as notes and assignments can be completed much faster and more neatly using these tools.Nonetheless, the practical skills such as using and holding a pen correctly are likewise vital for future careers. For that reason, students have to be taught at early ages how to carry out simple tasks using basic skills, such as writing. It is also essential that a student develops neat handwriting, as in the case of a technological problem the student will have to write by hand. Furthermore, final exams are typically written by hand and thus the student must develop the basic skill of holding a pen and writing with it. Mathematics skills are no different. People will not always have a device with them to carry out calculations and the ability to do arithmetic in the head is a vital skill for operating in today’s world.In conclusion, I personally believe that schools should keep a balance between using practical skills and using electronic equipment to carry out certain tasks by having student submit assignments created electronically, yet also by having them complete assignments by hand in class and without computers or calculators. This balance is important, as if the focus lies only on one of the two aspects, the student will face problems later on in life.;The rapid growth of computer usage worldwide has led to a significant increase in the use of technological equipment in schools globally. This has sparked a debate about whether schools should prioritize teaching students basic handwriting skills and mental mathematics skills. With the advent of the digital age, technology has become an integral part of lessons, and nearly all professions now require computer skills, even for simple tasks. Therefore, it is crucial for students to learn how to use technology effectively to prepare them for their future careers. Electronic devices offer numerous learning benefits, including faster and neater completion of notes and assignments.However, practical skills like holding a pen correctly and using it to write are also essential for future careers. Students should be taught these basic skills from an early age, including writing by hand. Developing neat handwriting is vital, as technological issues may require students to write by hand, and final exams are typically written by hand, requiring students to have the basic skill of holding a pen and writing with it. Similarly, mental mathematics skills are crucial, as people may not always have access to a device to perform calculations, and the ability to do arithmetic mentally is a vital skill for navigating today's world.In conclusion, I believe that schools should strike a balance between using practical skills and electronic equipment. This can be achieved by having students submit assignments created electronically, while also completing assignments by hand in class without computers or calculators. Maintaining this balance is important, as an overemphasis on one aspect may lead to problems for students in the future. By combining traditional skills with technology, students can develop a comprehensive set of skills that will serve them well in their future careers.
1303;With the scale of globalisation today, it would be of unquestioned benefit to have a single world currency.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;Globalisation has become a significant aspect of the world’s modern economy, with countless industries and businesses expanding in various countries. This has led to the debate of developing a world currency with many people believing it could drastically help further develop economies and assist in the development of many countries.A worldwide currency could bring on effects similar to when Euro was developed for Europe. Trade could be significantly encouraged, as there would be no exchange rate fluctuation risks between different currencies. Moreover, tourists would not need to exchange money when travelling.However, there are certain risks to a global currency, which definitely do not make it an “unquestioned benefit”. Countries in debt would not be able to lower their currency value to make consumer goods more desirable, which could develop into a severe economic issue. For example, the US regulated its interest rates to increase the money resources in order to diminish the effect of a recent recession. Also economic problems, such as in Greece, have actually been made worse by the use of the common Euro. If applied worldwide, many countries’ economies could be very similarly negatively impacted. Finally, many countries around the world do not have a stable enough economy to be able to enter a common currency. If weaker countries were to adopt a world currency, this could be disastrous to their economy and to the economies of other countries using the same currency.In conclusion, the extent to which a global currency would be beneficial is quite low. It seems to me that the risks outweigh the benefits, as if a country were to lose economic stability, the world would be impacted as well. For that reason, I feel that in present circumstances, it is best to have separate currencies to protect countries from economic recession.;The modern global economy has been shaped significantly by globalization, with numerous industries and businesses expanding across various countries. This has sparked a debate about introducing a single world currency, which many believe could greatly enhance economic development and assist in the growth of many nations. A global currency could have a similar impact to the introduction of the Euro in Europe, promoting trade by eliminating the risks associated with exchange rate fluctuations between different currencies. Additionally, tourists would no longer need to exchange currencies when traveling, making international transactions more convenient.However, the idea of a global currency is not without its drawbacks. One of the primary concerns is that countries with significant debt would lose the ability to devalue their currency, making their consumer goods more competitive in the global market. This could lead to severe economic problems. For instance, the US has used interest rate adjustments to increase money supply and mitigate the effects of a recent recession. The economic challenges faced by countries like Greece have been exacerbated by the adoption of the Euro, demonstrating that a common currency can have negative consequences. If replicated on a global scale, many countries could experience similar adverse effects.Furthermore, many countries lack the economic stability required to participate in a global currency system. If weaker economies were to adopt a world currency, it could have disastrous consequences for their economy and the economies of other countries using the same currency. In light of these considerations, it appears that the benefits of a global currency are limited. The risks seem to outweigh the advantages, as a country's loss of economic stability could have far-reaching impacts on the global economy. Therefore, under current circumstances, it seems prudent to maintain separate currencies to protect countries from economic downturns.
1295;With the vast increase in online resources today, libraries with print books are not a necessity for today’s society.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your knowledge or experience.You should write at least 250 words.;It is indeed true that digital resources today far outstrip what can be put and stored in print books. Almost any kind of book can now be accessed digitally and those that can’t be will soon be changed to a digital format. Some people, therefore, believe that libraries with print books are no longer needed.If one looks at this issue dispassionately, it seems far more logical that people now should only read books digitally. It only requires a single computer or electronic reader and an individual can have access to the history of literature and works on all other fields. The costs involved with setting, typing, printing and distributing print books would practically disappear and this would make things more convenient and much cheaper. An actual library building would be totally unnecessary, as all one would need would be a ‘virtual library’ as a website and all works could be accessed through this portal. There would not even be any need to leave the house to gain access to anything one needed. This would seem to be the most logical way of proceeding.Logic, however, is not always the best approach to everything. Print books have a long history with humanity and our relationship with real books is not something that can be changed overnight. Many people, including younger readers, feel that there is something special about having a book with real paper and needing to turn pages. There will therefore for the time being be a future for print books and libraries.Libraries will continue to be especially important, as not all older people use computers and e-readers as much as the younger generation. They will still want to read print books and the library is a cheap and convenient place to find them. In addition, if only a few books in print are available in the future, libraries might be one of the few places where they might be accessed. Another purpose that libraries serve is acting as community centres that organise events, education and childcare. Ironically, libraries also provide computers and Internet access for people who cannot afford their own.In spite of the seeming dominance to come of digital books, I feel that there is and will be a place for libraries with print books. This state of affairs might change in the future, but at present, they are important community resources.;"The notion that digital resources have surpassed the capabilities of print books is undeniable. With the majority of books now available in digital format, and the rest soon to follow, some argue that libraries with physical books are no longer necessary. From a practical standpoint, it appears logical that people should opt for digital reading. A single computer or e-reader can grant access to a vast array of literary works and historical texts, eliminating the costs associated with printing, distributing, and storing physical books. This shift would render library buildings obsolete, as all resources could be accessed through a virtual library portal, allowing individuals to stay at home and still access everything they need. This seems like the most efficient approach.However, logic is not always the best guide for every situation. The relationship between humans and physical books has a long and rich history, and altering this connection overnight is not feasible. Many individuals, including younger readers, have a strong affinity for physical books, appreciating the tactile experience of turning pages and holding a book in their hands. Consequently, for the foreseeable future, there will remain a place for print books and the libraries that house them.Libraries will continue to serve a vital purpose, particularly for older generations who may not be as adept with digital technology. These institutions provide a convenient and affordable means for people to access print books. Furthermore, in a potential future where print books are scarce, libraries may become one of the few remaining places where they can be found. Libraries also function as community hubs, hosting events, educational programs, and childcare services. Paradoxically, they offer computer and internet access to those who cannot afford these amenities at home.Despite the growing dominance of digital books, I firmly believe that libraries with print books will continue to have a significant role. While this may change in the future, currently, they remain invaluable community resources. The importance of libraries extends beyond mere book storage; they are dynamic spaces that foster learning, community engagement, and access to information, making them an integral part of our societal fabric."
1392;Without capital punishment (the death penalty) our lives are less secure and crimes of violence increase. Capital punishment is essential to control violence in society. To what extent do you agree or disagree?;Capital punishment is always associated with ignorance and intolerance. In fact, we must acknowledge that some people disagree with this kind of penalty, but others vote in its favor. Portugal was the first European country to end this kind of penalty. Since the 19th century, tolerance and respect for life important values. Moreover, we can affirm that remains under the same codes. Maybe because of a religious view point, the respect for life is a typical value in the Old Catholic world.Those who are in favor of capital punishment mostly live in developing countries. However, this is not just an image of the Third World countries. Actually, the USA is one country where this kind of punishment has its rates of application. The state of Texas, in particular, is at the top, supporting this measure against crime, especially those involving serial killers and crimes against children. In a society dominated by fear and government control, it is foreseen that this penalty will continue .Maybe this is not a simple question. As we can see there are several values here and of course cultural behavior. The roots of the question are religious, cultural, ethical and even geographical. The world is divided and the law systems show this division. The solutions, however can lead us to other questions concerning revenge and justice. better to kill a person because of his crimes? Can we admit that a life sentence could be a much better sentence? In fact, rehabilitation is the right way especially with an accurate psychological evaluation first. Some people are lost forever, and in my opinion some murderers and other criminals will suffer more in jail. In this sense, capital punishment is an easy way out.;Capital punishment is often linked to ignorance and intolerance, but it's essential to recognize that opinions on this issue are divided. While some individuals vehemently oppose the death penalty, others actively support it. Portugal was a pioneer in Europe, abolishing capital punishment in the 19th century, a move that underscored the importance of tolerance and the value of human life. These values have remained steadfast, possibly due to the country's strong Catholic heritage, where the sanctity of life is deeply ingrained.Support for capital punishment is more prevalent in developing countries, but it's also practiced in nations like the United States, where its application rates are significant. Notably, Texas stands out for its strong stance on capital punishment, particularly for crimes committed by serial killers and against children. In societies marked by fear and stringent government control, the continuation of capital punishment seems likely.The question of capital punishment is complex, entwined with religious, cultural, ethical, and geographical factors. The world's division on this issue is reflected in its legal systems. Efforts to find solutions lead to further questions about the nature of justice and revenge. Is it just to take a life in retribution for a crime? Could a life sentence, especially one preceded by a thorough psychological assessment, be a more appropriate punishment? Rehabilitation, guided by accurate psychological evaluations, is arguably the most constructive approach. Some individuals may be beyond redemption, but for many, the suffering inherent in a life imprisonment can be a more profound punishment. In this light, capital punishment can be seen as an easier, less nuanced solution.The debate around capital punishment touches on deep-seated values and behaviors, highlighting the need for a nuanced discussion that considers the multifaceted aspects of justice, ethics, and human rights. As the world grapples with these questions, it's clear that there are no simple answers, only a complex interplay of moral, legal, and societal considerations.
1430;Without capital punishment our lives are less secure and crimes or violence increase. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?;"Serious crimes need capital punishment so that the are unable to get involved in the crime in the future. However, they want to stop the acts of violation in the future then it would be better to .Overall, I agree with the fact that punishment is the way to avoid the and hence our lives become more secure. If the wrongdoer wants to be a good and there is a particular financial or personal problem that led him to the wrong way, then it would be the nice option to forgive him and try to solve the problem he . Although by this way, some bad may become effective of the society but some do not bring themselves to the right path because they are . The person that involved in the crime and never to stop the law-breaking act should be punished in extremely serious way. However, it totally depends on the nature of crime. Some to a capital punishment and some may require a small penalty. The law-making institutions are responsible to bring the bad man to the right level of punishment that he deserves. If there is weak legislation to properly handle the offender, it may for the good . The government should be the responsible authority to provide a secure and better state to live. Laws should be implemented and executed in the most proper way that not allow the offender to commit violent acts or to break the law in any way and to any extent. To sum up, it is the responsibility of the state to stop people involved in crime. It may be done through solving the problems of the people that led them to commit that act or by the punishment accordingly.Where are the paragraphs? This is a good essay; however there are many small mistakes that might cost you dearly. There are also several unclear expressions and grammatical errors.";Serious crimes warrant capital punishment to prevent the perpetrator from committing further crimes in the future. However, if the goal is to prevent future acts of violation, then it would be more effective to address the underlying issues that led to the crime. Overall, I agree that punishment is a necessary measure to deter crime and ensure public safety.If an offender wants to reform and there is a specific financial or personal problem that led them astray, then it may be more beneficial to forgive them and help resolve their issues. Although this approach may allow some individuals to take advantage of the system, others may genuinely seek to reform and become productive members of society. Those who persist in committing crimes and show no intention of stopping should face severe punishment. The severity of the punishment, however, depends on the nature of the crime. Some crimes may warrant capital punishment, while others may require only a minor penalty.It is the responsibility of law-making institutions to determine the appropriate level of punishment for each offender. Weak legislation can be detrimental to maintaining public safety, and it is the government's duty to provide a secure environment for its citizens. Laws should be implemented and enforced in a manner that prevents offenders from committing violent acts or breaking the law in any way. In conclusion, it is the state's responsibility to prevent people from engaging in criminal activity, either by addressing the underlying problems that led to the crime or by imposing suitable punishment.
163;Write about the following topic.Although there are a lot of translation software available, learning a language could still be advantageous. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people claim that language knowledge has still benefited inspite of appearance of applications and websites providing translation in real time. Modern special software is able to give quite quality translation into different languages, and it seems that it will soon replace the translators and will get rid of necessity to learn new languages. However, in my opinion, there are still some essential advantages to know foreign languages.First of all, any language is so complicated and constantly changing system that it is impossible to automized translation process to keep all senses. For instance, if you interlocutor creates a joke based on words game, it will unlikely recognise by AI. Thus, it is too hard to teach a computer to uderstand all meanings that you want to provide.Another important aspect of learning languages is knowing new cultures. Language is the great source for understanding other nations and countries. If you use online translator, you will never know the origine of some idioms or phrases that contain culture code.Moreover, learning new language is a tool of training your brain. It helps to develop memory and imagination. For instance, people didn't refuse studying maths after calculation device had been invented, because it is still important to understand how it works and it is necessary for developing other sciences.Finally, there is a lot of places and occasions when you do not have internet access. Then online translators are not available. But if you need help or ask a path being abroad, it is better to know at least some phrases. Otherwise, you can occur in unpleasant situation.To sum up, I definitely agree the statement that learning languages is essential in spite of techology progress. Although artificial intelligence is able to translate everything you want, it is crucial to continue learning languages in order to understand all sense and meanings in conversation with foreigners, to know new cultures and understand their peculiarities and, of course, to make your brain work.;Despite the emergence of real-time translation applications and websites, some individuals argue that acquiring language knowledge remains beneficial. Advanced software can provide high-quality translations into various languages, leading to speculation that it may soon replace human translators and eliminate the need to learn new languages. However, I firmly believe that there are still significant advantages to knowing foreign languages.Firstly, languages are complex and constantly evolving systems, making it impossible for automated translation processes to capture all nuances. For instance, if a conversational partner creates a joke based on wordplay, it is unlikely to be recognized by artificial intelligence. Teaching a computer to comprehend all intended meanings is a daunting task.Another crucial aspect of language learning is gaining insight into new cultures. Language serves as a vital source for understanding other nations and countries. Relying solely on online translators would mean missing out on the origins of idioms and phrases that contain cultural codes.Furthermore, acquiring a new language is an excellent tool for training the brain, enhancing memory and imagination. Similar to how people continue to study mathematics despite the invention of calculation devices, learning languages remains essential for understanding the underlying mechanisms and for advancing other sciences.Lastly, there are numerous situations and locations where internet access is unavailable, rendering online translators useless. In such cases, knowing basic phrases in a foreign language can be incredibly helpful, especially when seeking assistance or asking for directions while abroad. Without this knowledge, one may find themselves in uncomfortable or difficult situations.In conclusion, I strongly agree that learning languages is essential, despite technological advancements. Although artificial intelligence can translate text, it is vital to continue learning languages to fully comprehend conversations with foreigners, appreciate new cultures, and exercise the brain. The benefits of language knowledge extend far beyond the capabilities of technology, making it an invaluable skill to possess.

Why are more people choosing to have operation to change the way they look? Do you think this a positive or negative development?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;A greater number of individuals opted for plastic surgery to enhance the physical outlook. What could be the reason behind the increasing number of people opting for cosmetic surgery to deter their appearance.In my opinion the main reason why cosmetic surgery is in demand nowadays is because society has set a certain standard that physical appearance will be the fastest ticket to stand out in the crowd. Second is it boosts confidence to people with low self esteem.The favorable outcome is not as much the adverse effect to the individuals. Example, the fastest way to reduce wrinkles on the face is to get Botox treatment. It lasts 3-4 months, after that it needs continuous medication to maintain what has been changed. It takes a lot of money to satisfy the demands of the society. On top of that repetition of pain and recovery during and after the surgery.There are numerous natural ways to enhance beauty and confidence. Contentment, exercise and a healthy lifestyle are effective methods to maintain the genuine beauty of the people. Simple walking in the morning, keeping the distance from negativity and eating vegetables and fruits are the simplest methods that boost the natural glow of the body and prevent us from being sick.To conclude the essay, I think plastic surgery is not necessary to enhance physical outlook as it uses synthetic components that have harmful effects within the body.;An increasing number of individuals are undergoing plastic surgery to enhance their physical appearance. But what drives this growing trend of opting for cosmetic surgery to alter one's looks? In my opinion, the primary reason for the surge in demand for cosmetic surgery is the societal pressure to conform to certain beauty standards, which are perceived as the key to standing out in a crowd. Another significant factor is that it boosts confidence in individuals with low self-esteem.However, the benefits of cosmetic surgery are often outweighed by its adverse effects. For instance, Botox treatments, which are a quick fix for reducing facial wrinkles, only last for 3-4 months and require ongoing medication to maintain the results. This not only involves significant financial costs but also recurring pain and recovery periods during and after the surgery.Fortunately, there are numerous natural and healthier alternatives to enhance beauty and confidence. Embracing contentment, regular exercise, and a healthy lifestyle are effective ways to maintain one's natural beauty. Simple habits such as morning walks, avoiding negativity, and consuming vegetables and fruits are easy yet powerful methods to boost the body's natural glow and prevent illnesses.In conclusion, I believe that plastic surgery is not a necessary means to enhance physical appearance, given its reliance on synthetic components that can have harmful effects on the body. Instead, embracing natural and holistic approaches to beauty and wellness can lead to a more lasting and healthier sense of confidence and beauty.

What solutions can you suggest?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Most children are facing one form of bullying or the other in our schools on daily basis world wide. It is becoming a serious problem and there is a need to solve this. In this essay, we would be considering two causes and possible ways to solve these.First of all, the rate at which children bullying each other in the school environment is rising. One major cause is that bullying breeds bullying, children who are faced with physical, mental and emotional abuse from homes tend to transfer their fustrations on their peers. They think that is how one is supposed to live, exacting authority to gain superiority on weaker peers in school. Another is children who has low self esteem, such students feels threatened over their classmates they taught to be more intelligent or having better physical appearance than them.Although, there are several causes of bullying, teachers should be taught how to identify children who are from abusive homes and inform the appropriate authority. These students would taken away from such toxic environment early and they would be sent for some pschological therapy. Meanwhile, education is also a key factor especially for children who have low self esteem. This should be done by forms such as role plays, presentation and drama, where these students are taught how to have self love and accepting what they can not change on their self.In conclusion, children from abusive homes and those who have low self esteem are some of the reasons for bullying. I recommend that early identification of abusive children and education is some of the ways we can solve these problems.;Bullying is a pervasive issue affecting children worldwide, with most students experiencing some form of it on a daily basis. This problem has become increasingly serious, necessitating a solution. This essay will explore two primary causes of bullying and potential ways to address them.The incidence of bullying among children in schools is alarmingly on the rise. One significant cause is the cyclical nature of bullying, where children who suffer physical, mental, and emotional abuse at home often redirect their frustrations towards their peers. These children may believe that exerting authority over weaker classmates is the norm, as they have learned from their abusive environments. Another cause is low self-esteem, where students feel threatened by classmates they perceive as more intelligent or physically attractive.Although there are multiple factors contributing to bullying, it is crucial for teachers to be trained to identify students from abusive homes and report them to the relevant authorities. These students can then be removed from toxic environments and provided with psychological therapy. Education also plays a vital role, particularly for students with low self-esteem. This can be achieved through interactive methods such as role-playing, presentations, and drama, which teach students self-acceptance and self-love, helping them to embrace aspects of themselves that they cannot change.In conclusion, children from abusive homes and those with low self-esteem are primary contributors to the bullying problem. To address this issue, I recommend the early identification of at-risk students and education as key strategies. By implementing these measures, we can work towards creating a safer and more supportive environment for all students.

However, this method of shopping has both advantages and disadvantages.On the one hand, the advantages of online shopping are numerous. For instance, it saves time and energy as it allows individuals to browse and purchase products from the comfort of their own homes. With just a few clicks, customers can select and receive their desired items without having to physically visit a store. This convenience is a significant benefit of online shopping.On the other hand, online shopping also has several drawbacks. One of the main disadvantages is the risk of order delays, which can result in packages being delivered at inconvenient times, such as when the customer is not at home or is asleep. Additionally, there is also the issue of incorrect orders, where customers receive items they did not order, or experience discrepancies in the quality or color of the product compared to what was advertised on the website. Unfortunately, some companies have been known to misrepresent their products in terms of quality and color, which can lead to customer dissatisfaction.In my opinion, if one wants to shop online, it is essential to research the website beforehand to ensure it is reputable and secure. This is crucial to avoid potential scams or theft. On the other hand, shopping at department stores can be a more comfortable and safer experience, as customers can see and touch products before making a purchase, and are less likely to encounter issues with quality or authenticity.
515;Write about the following topic.Cohabitation is believed to bring huge advantages for young people since it enables them to fully understand each other before deciding to get married.Do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many people believe it may be advisable for couples to live together before getting married, as it may lead to a smoother relationship after they have married.I tend to agree with such opinions, as I find the arguments that usually support them to be quite reasonable. For example, it is commonly said that people act differently when they are at home and when they are outside. People instinctively tend to be more relaxed and off-guard when at home, whereas in social situations they usually make an effort, even if unconsciously, to be more likable and to conceal the less agreeable aspects of their personality from others, even their partners. Because of this, it is usual to hear that one does not truly know someone until one has lived with that person.In extreme cases, cohabitation before marriage could even prevent couples from entering into a marriage that is bound to fail and will lead to unhappiness. Considering this possibility seems reasonable, as marriage is not only an emotional bond, but also a legal one, and undoing it is usually upsetting, time-consuming and costly.Another reason I find cohabitation before marriage to be a sensible choice is that, as minor disagreements and conflicts are usually inevitable during the first months of cohabitation, it is preferable to pass through that stage before getting married than to add such problems to a period which in itself can already be stressful, such as the few weeks before the ceremony and the weeks following.What I have said up to this point reflects my opinion, but it must be noted I did not put any of it into practice when I got married. Indeed, my wife and I decided to move in together only a few weeks before the ceremony. This decision was due to the fact that her family is quite old-fashioned, and moving in together before would undoubtedly have caused them pain, even if we had our reasons for doing so and they would have understood them. No degree of persuasion would have avoided or removed such pain. We found the long-term benefits of a stable and close relationship with her family to be more important than the discomfort of not moving in together, and we ultimately decided to do it only once the ceremony was planned.;Many people believe that living together before marriage can be beneficial, as it may lead to a more harmonious relationship after tying the knot. I concur with this viewpoint, as the arguments in favor of it seem logical. The notion that people's behavior differs significantly when they're in their own home versus in public is a common observation. At home, individuals tend to be more relaxed and genuine, whereas in social situations, they often make a conscious effort to present a more likable and polished version of themselves, even to their partner. This is why it's often said that you don't truly know someone until you've lived with them.In some cases, cohabiting before marriage can even prevent couples from entering into a doomed marriage that would inevitably lead to unhappiness. It's reasonable to consider this possibility, given that marriage is not only an emotional commitment but also a legal one, and dissolving it can be a stressful, time-consuming, and costly process.Another reason I think cohabitation before marriage makes sense is that it allows couples to work through the inevitable minor disagreements and conflicts that arise during the early stages of living together. It's better to navigate these challenges before getting married, rather than adding them to an already stressful period, such as the weeks leading up to the wedding and the weeks that follow.It's worth noting, however, that I didn't put these principles into practice when I got married. My wife and I decided to move in together just a few weeks before the ceremony, due to her family's traditional values. We knew that living together before the wedding would have caused them significant distress, even if they understood our reasons for doing so. We prioritized maintaining a positive and close relationship with her family over the potential benefits of cohabiting before marriage, and ultimately decided to wait until after the wedding plans were in place.

What measures can be taken to protect them?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;These days, consumers often suffer from the increase of numbers of advertisements conducted by competing companies. I believe that this fact has certain negative effects on consumers' working performance as well as their private space and time. In order to protect consumers, some proposals related to protecting their information and eliminating the number of advertisements are required.The increasing number of advertisements has a negative effect on the consumers. Firstly, their working perfomance can be reduced. Obivously, when a person is working, he cannot receive a large number of advertisements, process and response them. I know a researcher who receives a lot of advertising emails from certain banksand even some scientific journal while he require time to perform many research projects. This makes him feel uncomfortable when working, thereby reducing the research's quality. Secondly, the advertisements can affect on people private space and time. For examle, when they spend time on their family after a hard working day, or even when they are sleeping. This completyly affects on the consumers, in terms of both physical and mental health.For protecting consumers, certain methods need to be proposed. Firstly, it can be implied that the consumers' information is illegal used by many companies. Therefore, an imporvement of security method can allow us to protect consumers. Secondly, eliminating the number of advertisements performed by companies and eliminating the hours for companies send advertisements are required.In conclusion, the increasing numbers of advertisements leads to certain unwanted results for consumers, such as reducing their working performance as well as their private space and time. For protecting consumers, we need to protect their personal information and eliminate the number of advertisements.;The proliferation of advertisements from competing companies has become a significant concern for consumers in recent times. I firmly believe that this trend has detrimental effects on consumers' productivity, private space, and personal time. To safeguard consumers' interests, it is essential to propose measures that protect their personal information and limit the number of advertisements they are exposed to.The escalating number of advertisements has a profound negative impact on consumers. Firstly, it can lead to a decline in their work performance. It is evident that when individuals are working, they cannot effectively process and respond to a multitude of advertisements, which can be distracting and time-consuming. For instance, a researcher I know receives numerous advertising emails from banks and scientific journals, which hampers their ability to focus on research projects, thereby compromising the quality of their work. Secondly, advertisements can encroach upon people's private space and time, such as when they are spending quality time with their family after a long day of work or even when they are sleeping. This can have severe repercussions on consumers' physical and mental well-being.To protect consumers from these adverse effects, several strategies can be employed. Firstly, it is crucial to acknowledge that many companies misuse consumers' personal information. Therefore, enhancing security measures can help safeguard consumers' data. Secondly, limiting the number of advertisements that companies can send and restricting the hours during which they can send these advertisements are necessary steps. By implementing these measures, we can create a more balanced and respectful environment for consumers.In conclusion, the surge in advertisements has undesirable consequences for consumers, including decreased productivity and erosion of private space and time. To mitigate these effects, it is vital to protect consumers' personal information and curb the number of advertisements. By doing so, we can foster a healthier and more considerate relationship between consumers and companies.

This essay explains why I disagree closure of local business will bring about the death of local communities with relevant examples.First, Big company drag the new residents. I believe major company make the local communities to flourish. My cusion lived in countryside for 30 years. Every time when I visited that place, that farm land still same during the a few decades. However, recently when I dropped by there I surprised with new tall building that newly built. My cusion told me once the big supermarkert open in this neighborhood, grasp many couples or familly to live here. Eventually, that rural place's population is surged.Someone thought giant grocery's product cheap price can not compete with local product, that make local place to close. I considered it is anachromism idea. Now the customer's purchasing value is totally diffrent with previous eras. Buyer start choose organic product and eco-friendlly or morality brand. If local stores have their own unique products, which are not replace with other, such as handmade cheese and unique taste of bread, local bussiness can compete with global chain markets.In conclusion, albeit famous company expands their sites every moments, the local community can be larger by new residents settled down near local region. Also, local bussiness have specialty, community can not dismissed;As large corporations expand their business, it is often assumed that local markets will suffer and eventually disappear. However, this essay argues that the closure of local businesses will not necessarily lead to the decline of local communities, and provides relevant examples to support this claim.Firstly, big companies can actually attract new residents to an area, contributing to the growth and development of local communities. For instance, my cousin has lived in a rural area for over 30 years, and during that time, the farm land remained relatively unchanged. However, with the recent opening of a large supermarket in the neighborhood, many young couples and families have moved to the area, resulting in a surge in population. This influx of new residents has brought new life to the community.Some people believe that the low prices of products offered by giant grocery stores cannot be competed with by local businesses, leading to their closure. However, I consider this idea to be outdated. In today's market, consumers are increasingly prioritizing organic, eco-friendly, and morally responsible products. If local stores can offer unique products that cannot be replicated by global chain markets, such as handmade cheese and artisanal bread, they can effectively compete with larger corporations. This is because these products offer a distinct value that cannot be found elsewhere.In conclusion, despite the rapid expansion of famous companies, local communities can actually benefit from the arrival of new residents. Additionally, local businesses have a unique advantage in offering specialized products that cater to the community's needs, making them an integral part of the local ecosystem. Therefore, the growth of large corporations does not necessarily mean the decline of local communities.

While sports participation is important, it is equally fundamental to prioritize safety and take measures to avoid injuries. This essay has explored the realm of extreme sports and their associated risks, culminating in my personal perspective on the matter.
479;Write about the following topic.Few people devote time to hobbies nowadays. Say why you think this is the case and what effect this has on the individual and society in general.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Hobbies are recreational activities that are pursued away from one's school or work. They are meant to be an escape from the mundane and a way of keeping people sane and happy. Unfortunately, they have become almost a luxury in today's fast-paced world.Several reasons can account for this massive decrease in the pursuit of hobbies. One such reason is the fact that hobbies require time and money which are two very dear resources in today's world. Social sophistication and technological advancements have brought about changes in hobbies. What used to be called hobbies in the past are now considered obsolete and the new ones, including video games and virtual reality require financial commitment in their pursuit. Even if one has the money to pursue such, he or she would have to set aside time in his or her busy schedule to enjoy those hobbies. It is therefore no wonder that most people found to pursue hobbies today are either wealthy youth or comfortable pensioners.Secondly, lack of interest may be an important factor why people devote little to no time to hobbies. Most of the educated lot are taught from a tender age only to concentrate on their studies in order to secure a comfortable future for themselves. Such children are discouraged from enjoying anything away from anything extracurricular and therefore grow into hobby-less adults who work all day and do nothing else otherwise. This is seen in a lot of Ghanaian homes where doing anything other than studying after school is deemed a taboo. Consequently, many grow into adults with little humour or mirth.Moreover, many people get exhausted with school or work, which have become extremely intensive nowadays, as compared to the more laid back past. After a tiring day, most people like to crawl into their beds to catch a night-long rest only to return to their busy life the next day.This lack of hobby pursuit, though understandable, does the individual and society more harm than good. Many individuals today are being treated for one mental health or another. Hobbies are a good way to relax and destress through leisure and can go a long way to improve mental health. Its absence will only wreak havoc for the society, which will only consist of tired and apathetic individuals who could not care less about each other and their surroundings.In conclusion, it is important, albeit difficult, to pay attention to hobbies in order to improve the health and psyche of the individual and society as a whole. More effort should be geared at encouraging hobbies at school and at the work place.;Engaging in hobbies, or recreational activities outside of school or work, is essential for maintaining one's mental health and happiness. Hobbies serve as a much-needed escape from the monotony of daily life, allowing individuals to unwind and recharge. However, in today's fast-paced world, pursuing hobbies has become a luxury that few can afford.There are several reasons why hobbies have become less of a priority. Firstly, hobbies require time and money, two resources that are increasingly scarce in modern life. The evolution of social sophistication and technological advancements has led to a shift in the types of hobbies people engage in. Traditional hobbies have become outdated, and new ones, such as video games and virtual reality, require a significant financial investment. Even for those who can afford these hobbies, finding the time to pursue them amidst a busy schedule can be a challenge. As a result, it is often only the wealthy and retirees who have the means and leisure to engage in hobbies.Another significant factor contributing to the decline of hobby pursuit is a lack of interest. From a young age, many individuals are encouraged to focus solely on their studies, with the goal of securing a comfortable future. This narrow focus can lead to a lack of exploration and development of hobbies, resulting in adults who are unfulfilled and lack a sense of humor or joy. This phenomenon is prevalent in many Ghanaian households, where any activity outside of studying is discouraged.Furthermore, the increasing intensity of school and work has left many individuals exhausted. After a long day, the only desire is to rest and prepare for the next day's challenges. This cycle of work and rest has led to a neglect of hobbies, which is detrimental to both individual and societal well-being. The absence of hobbies can lead to increased stress, mental health issues, and a sense of apathy among individuals, ultimately affecting the overall health of society.In conclusion, it is crucial to prioritize hobbies, despite the challenges, to improve the mental health and well-being of individuals and society as a whole. Efforts should be made to encourage and facilitate hobby pursuit in schools and workplaces, recognizing the importance of hobbies in maintaining a healthy and balanced lifestyle. By doing so, we can work towards creating a more relaxed, creative, and compassionate society.
595;Write about the following topic.Group or team activities can teach more important skills for life than those activities which are done alone.Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The topic of group work can be more beneficial for peoples' lives than person who tend to do some work alone or not is widely discussed across the globe. Personally, I think there are some good advantages team activities cause our life,and especially in business scenes more comfortable and productive.Initially, only one person's work is limited, compared with group activities. This means that working only one person will be able to cause some profits to some extent. On the other hand, group working will be more productive and efficient to make more sales figures. In addition, each person has a great ability. For example, some people have great communication skills and negotiations. Those people arethe most appropriate roles for sales. Furthermore, some people are good at analysing the group performance quality and making strategies. Those who are good at these activities are best for marketing team. As a result, they can focus on their strong points for work and they can divide and conquer the tasks with each other.Of course, some people are eager to work alone at their own relaxed pace and make a profit to some extent. This is less stressful they do not need to keep attention from other colleagues. But this means that they need to decide all tasks and take all responsibility. Sometimes it might be risky once they made a mistake and caused a huge deficit.Finally, there is no doubt that more than two heads are better than one. People can share their experiences and opinion to improve their group activities. If some people who are sensitive and feel pressure if some people meddle in too much. It is necessary to organize some rules that must be effective. For example, all people need to try to stay positive, avoid stating negative or swear words, and not deny one person's opinion straightforwardly and emotionally. Making a great atmosphere, saying positive words with each other, and including some humor, will lead to everyone's performance being more productive.;The benefits of group work versus individual work are a widely debated topic globally. In my opinion, team activities have numerous advantages that make life, particularly in business settings, more efficient and productive. To begin with, individual work has its limitations. One person's capabilities can only yield a certain level of profit. In contrast, group work is more productive and efficient, leading to higher sales figures and better outcomes. Each person in a group brings unique abilities to the table. For instance, some individuals excel in communication and negotiation, making them ideal for sales roles. Others are skilled at analyzing performance quality and devising strategies, which makes them a perfect fit for marketing teams. As a result, team members can focus on their strengths, divide tasks effectively, and achieve more together.On the other hand, some people prefer working alone at their own pace, which can be less stressful as they don't have to consider input from colleagues. However, this approach means they have to handle all tasks and responsibilities alone, which can be risky if mistakes are made, potentially leading to significant losses.Ultimately, it's undeniable that multiple minds are better than one. Group work allows individuals to share experiences and opinions, leading to improved outcomes. For groups to function effectively, especially for sensitive individuals who may feel pressured by excessive input, it's crucial to establish clear rules. These rules should promote positivity, discourage negative language, and encourage respectful dialogue. By fostering a positive atmosphere, using encouraging language, and incorporating humor, groups can enhance each member's performance and productivity.This version maintains the core ideas and arguments of the original text but presents them in a clearer, more organized, and polished manner, with improved grammar and sentence structure.
317;Write about the following topic.In many countries large amounts of foods are wasted. Why do you think people waste food in this way? What can be done to reduce the amount of food thrown away?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, many countries are confronted with the increasing amount of waste and one of the major contributions is food wasted by people. This issue is mainly driven by an over-ordered food and misunderstanding about the method of food disposal. However, people could cease from creating food waste through the act of both restaurants and governments.To begin with, it is obvious that countries have wasted because the amount of food that people buy is more than the amount they need. The crucial factor of this behavior is that when people contemplate menus in a restaurant, they tend to order many items in order to satisfy their desire level. Eventually, a lot of food scraps are left when these people finish eating their meals. Another potential cause could be because people do not know how to deal with food scraps. As a result, they might understand that putting wasted food into a garbage is the only solution they could do. This is exemplified by statistics published by Thai waste association which demonstrate that more than a half of waste in Thailand come from household food.A possible solution for this matter could be for restaurants to fine their customers who leave some food. This policy possibly encourages customers to carefully think of the reasonable amount of food when they order. In addition, from the country’s level governments could also educate their citizens including companies in the food-service industry about how to do with food waste due to the fact that some edible items could be food for animals. For instance, authorities could give an instruction demonstrating that dogs can be fed with remaining food such as rice or bread while remaining vegetables can be food for rabbits.In conclusion, people waste food since they order food by what they want without considering the amount and most of them misunderstand about the way to dispose of food waste. Nevertheless, this concern can be coped with the penalty by restaurants as well as the guidance from governments regarding feeding animal with food scraps.;The issue of food waste has become a significant problem in many countries, with a substantial amount of waste being attributed to food discarded by individuals. This problem is largely driven by over-ordering and a lack of understanding about proper food disposal methods. However, it is possible for people to reduce food waste through the combined efforts of restaurants and governments.One of the primary reasons for food waste is that individuals often purchase more food than they need. When dining out, people tend to over-order to satisfy their cravings, resulting in a significant amount of leftover food. Additionally, many individuals are unaware of how to properly dispose of food waste, leading them to believe that throwing it away is the only option. This is supported by statistics from the Thai waste association, which show that over half of Thailand's waste comes from household food waste.One potential solution to this problem is for restaurants to implement a policy of fining customers who leave behind unfinished food. This could encourage customers to be more mindful of the amount of food they order. Furthermore, governments could play a crucial role in educating citizens, including those in the food service industry, on how to manage food waste. For example, authorities could provide guidelines on how to repurpose food waste as animal feed. Dogs, for instance, can be fed leftover rice or bread, while leftover vegetables can be used to feed rabbits.In conclusion, food waste is often the result of individuals ordering more food than they need, combined with a lack of understanding about proper disposal methods. Nevertheless, this issue can be addressed through a combination of penalties imposed by restaurants and guidance from governments on how to repurpose food waste as animal feed. By working together, it is possible to reduce the amount of food waste and promote more sustainable practices.
1025;Write about the following topic.In many countries, a small number of people earn extremely high salaries. Some people believe that this is good for the country, but others think that governments should not allow salaries above a certain level.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In many parts of the world, few people get a lot of money thanks to their job. It is believed by some that this is an advantage for the country, while it is thought by others that governments should put a limit above which salaries cannot be.In my opinion, I believe that not only people have to be rewarded for their performance, but also their wage salary has to be proportional to the benefits that they are leading to the country.For instance, due to the Covid a lot of people suffered several injuries which were cured only thanks to the doctors and the nurses. For this reason, since they are saving lifes everyday,it seems unbelievable the fact that they are earning much less money than football players.Another example can be found in people involved in the national security: I believe that it would be fairer if these professionals were paid more than an influencer.However, in our society this figures (such as doctors) are paid by governments through taxes, while football players or influncers gain incomes by private companies.In order to not impose an heavier taxation, politics should categorise jobs basing on their importance in the society. Hence, we will have a specific amount that these employers can earn.Thus, if these no-fundamental workers (like actors or actress) are earning more money than the precise level chosen, these will be used as funds to increase life-saving jobs' salary.In conclusion, I believe that highest salaries should exist only if we are referring to a job that is needed by everyone.;In many parts of the world, a small group of people earn extremely high salaries, while others struggle to make ends meet. Some people believe that this disparity is beneficial for the country, as it motivates individuals to work hard and innovate. However, others argue that governments should implement a salary cap to prevent excessive income inequality.In my opinion, I think that individuals should be rewarded for their performance, but their salaries should also be proportionate to the benefits they bring to society. For instance, during the Covid-19 pandemic, medical professionals such as doctors and nurses worked tirelessly to save lives. It is astonishing that they earn significantly less than football players, despite their life-saving work.Another example is the individuals involved in national security, who put their lives at risk to protect their country. It would be more equitable if they were paid more than social media influencers, who often have a relatively easy and lucrative job.However, the way our society is structured, essential workers like doctors are paid by the government through taxes, while football players and influencers earn their income from private companies. To avoid increasing taxation, governments could categorize jobs based on their importance to society and set a corresponding salary range. This would ensure that non-essential workers, such as actors, do not earn excessively high salaries. If they do earn more than the established limit, the excess funds could be used to increase the salaries of life-saving professionals.In conclusion, I believe that extremely high salaries should only be reserved for jobs that are essential to the well-being of society as a whole.

Do you think it is a positive or negative?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"At present, discovering one`s own family history is becoming more and more commom. In the following paragraphs, I will present the motives why people do that and the reason I strongly believe this is important and have positive effects on people.Probably the most crucial motive people search for their family`s past is to find out about any chronical diseases. One of society`s biggest concern nowadays is healthy leaving. Therefore, by knowing the family health history and genetic predisposition to a specific disease such as cancer or diabetes, one can prepare and take the appropriate mesures to prevent it or have an early treatment.Moreover, another reason people may seek for their ancestors`s history is to build a sense of belonging. Human beings need to feel welcomed and inserted into a culture; a community`s identity is as important as an individual one, as it provides people with the opportunity to grow and develop relantioships. When people know about their family history, their sense of belonging is promoted, and they can actively participate in their culture and contribute to their community.As mentioned in the previous paragraphs, people search about family history for health and cultural reasons. One and the other do impact positivily a person`s life, as being healthy and part of a community integrate people`s satisfaction about living.To summarize, one may try to find out about their family history for two main motives, one being about their health and the other one about feeling part of a community. Both reasons are important and have positive impacts on one`s life.";Discovering one's family history is becoming increasingly popular, and for good reason. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss the motivations behind this trend and explain why I firmly believe it has a profound impact on individuals.One of the primary reasons people research their family's past is to uncover information about potential chronic diseases that may run in their family. With healthy living being a major concern in today's society, understanding one's genetic predisposition to certain diseases, such as cancer or diabetes, can be incredibly valuable. By being aware of their family health history, individuals can take proactive measures to prevent or receive early treatment for these conditions.Another significant motivation for exploring one's ancestry is to establish a sense of belonging. Humans have an inherent need to feel connected to a community and culture, as this sense of identity is essential for personal growth and relationship-building. When individuals are knowledgeable about their family history, their sense of belonging is enhanced, enabling them to actively participate in their culture and contribute to their community.As previously mentioned, people investigate their family history for both health and cultural reasons. Both of these motivations have a positive impact on an individual's life, as being healthy and part of a community are integral to overall life satisfaction.In summary, there are two primary motivations for researching one's family history: health concerns and a desire to feel part of a community. Both of these reasons are significant and have a positive influence on one's life, highlighting the importance of exploring and understanding one's family roots.
987;Write about the following topic.Information technology is changing many aspects of our lives and now dominates our home, leisure and work activities.To what extent do the benefits of information technology outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;There is no doubt that these days information technology has invaded our space and dominated our home leisure and work. However, the question: is dominating our lives by this technology have a negative or positive impact on our lives? Is considered one of the most controversial issues today. In this essay, I am going to examine this phenomenon from both viewpoints.On one side of the argument, some people argue that the benefits considerably outweigh the disadvantages. The main reason for believing this is integrating technology in every aspect eases our lives and decreases hardworking. For example, advanced houses with integrated voice commands give the person the ability to achieve multiple tasks without any physical activity. Moreover, the technology allows people to connect multiple devices with an email address and control them remotely. One good illustration of that you can switch on and off your home AC while you are at work by the WIFI technology.On the other hand, it is also possible to consider it with the opposing case. It is often argued that in fact using advanced technology increase the number of unhealthy people. People often have this opinion because people become lazier, and their daily activity dramatically decreases making them prone to diseases.As we have seen, there are no easy answers to this question. On balance, however, I tend to believe that using advanced information technology should be limited to simple tasks, so at any point if a technical error happened you can resume your life without any obstacles.;The proliferation of information technology in our daily lives is undeniable, and its impact on our leisure, work, and homes is profound. However, the question of whether this dominance has a positive or negative effect on our lives remains a highly debated issue. This essay aims to explore this phenomenon from both perspectives, shedding light on the arguments for and against the pervasive use of technology.On the one hand, many argue that the benefits of technology far outweigh its drawbacks. The primary reason for this viewpoint is that technology integration into various aspects of life simplifies tasks and reduces manual labor. For instance, smart homes equipped with voice command systems enable individuals to perform multiple tasks without physical exertion. Furthermore, technology allows for the remote control of multiple devices connected via an email address, as exemplified by the ability to turn on or off home appliances, such as air conditioners, while away from home using Wi-Fi technology.On the other hand, there is a compelling counterargument. It is often contended that the use of advanced technology contributes to a rise in unhealthy lifestyles. This perspective stems from the notion that reliance on technology leads to increased laziness and a significant decrease in physical activity, thereby making individuals more susceptible to diseases.Ultimately, the answer to whether technology's influence is positive or negative is complex. Upon weighing the arguments, I am inclined to believe that the use of advanced information technology should be confined to straightforward tasks. This approach ensures that in the event of a technical malfunction, daily life can resume without significant obstacles. By adopting a balanced approach to technology use, we can harness its benefits while mitigating its potential negative impacts.
1033;Write about the following topic.It is inevitable that traditional cultures will be lost as technology develops. Technology and traditional cultures are incompatible.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this view?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many people hold the view that traditional culture and technological development cannot coexist as the latter catch on, the former will be bound to disappear. I totally disagree with this because both can be implemented jointly by putting technology at the service of tradition and through pilot projects.To begin with, technological progress, which is making major strides in our daily lives, is the means by which local mores, custom and traditions could be brought back to life, proving they are compatible. In fact, by tapping technology to make tradition far more attractive, considerably more audience will be engaged into such activities. Bologna is a case in point, since, thanks to digital machines and drones which have supported housewives into the making of , the traditional celebration of “making pasta day ” has recently being turned into a successful events, which draws people from country as far afield as China.Another example of possible coexistence is the possibility to heighten awareness of people costumes through the creation of pilot projects which bring both habits and technology to a new whole level. This can be put into practice by setting a direct connection to cultural heritage of a specific area of the world to those who do not have access easily. To this end, many primary schools in New York have developed a project in which, owing to the ultimate high speed connection, pupils who come from abroad can learn ancient craft directly from a master located in their country of origin.To conclude, I firmly believe that traditional culture and technology development are widely compatible as the technology can positively beef up the presence of cultural traditions nowadays, so as to keep its memory Alive. In addition, pioneering projects can be implemented to underpin cultural awareness amongst youngsters.;"The notion that traditional culture and technological advancements are mutually exclusive is a common misconception. Many believe that as technology advances, traditional culture will inevitably fade away. However, I strongly disagree with this perspective, as I believe that both can coexist and complement each other. By harnessing technology to serve tradition, and through innovative pilot projects, we can ensure the preservation and promotion of cultural heritage.Firstly, technological progress, which is increasingly prevalent in our daily lives, can be a powerful tool in revitalizing local customs, traditions, and mores. By leveraging technology, we can make traditional practices more appealing and engaging, thereby attracting a broader audience. A notable example is the city of Bologna, where digital machinery and drones have assisted housewives in preparing traditional pasta, transforming the ""making pasta day"" celebration into a successful event that draws visitors from as far away as China.Another example of the potential coexistence of tradition and technology is the creation of pilot projects that combine traditional habits with modern technology, elevating them to new heights. This can be achieved by establishing a direct connection between the cultural heritage of a specific region and those who may not have easy access to it. For instance, several primary schools in New York have developed a project that utilizes high-speed internet connections to enable pupils from abroad to learn ancient crafts directly from a master craftsman in their country of origin.In conclusion, I firmly believe that traditional culture and technological development are entirely compatible. Technology can positively enhance the presence of cultural traditions, keeping their memory alive. Moreover, pioneering projects can be implemented to foster cultural awareness among young people, ensuring the continuation of our cultural heritage. By embracing this synergy, we can preserve the past while embracing the future."

Never has this area been exploded before so researchers could discover crucial information for thesis and tourists could appreciate a fabulous landscape. However, discovering those faraway environments could increase environment-related issues such as climatic change.South Pole is a place which has ever seen human activities before, and it seems to have numerous discoveries to make. Indeed, scientists which fauna and flora are the current studies, could find new mode of the marine life and discover new species. Moreover, people who are interested in travelling to South Pole might now do it, children who dreamed about polar animals could see them. Thus, the tourism should create new jobs and develop economic growth.Nevertheless, as each breakthrough that the society does, there are repercussions. In this case, the harmful effect of this discovery is global warming because when humans go somewhere, they let a carbon footprint which directly changes the environment. For instance, if individuals had to travel to South Pole, they would only use air or marine transport such as cruise ship which pollute the area with greenhouse gases. As a result, those greenhouse gases can warm nature which, unfortunately, would melt the ice and have a detrimental impact on the landscapes. As a consequence, in the forthcoming decades, this panorama may disappear. Thereby, if scientists want to study this natural area, they could not or in a limited way.To conclude, the advantages could be to discover new landscapes and how species can live in this hostile area. However, just going into this remote natural environment could destroy it before discovering something.;The advancement of our society has made it possible for individuals to travel to remote areas, such as the South Pole, which was previously unexplored. This untouched region offers a unique opportunity for researchers to gather crucial information for their studies and for tourists to marvel at its breathtaking landscape. However, exploring these distant environments also poses a risk of exacerbating environmental issues, including climate change.The South Pole, a region that has remained untouched by human activity, holds a wealth of discoveries waiting to be made. Scientists studying the fauna and flora of this area may uncover new modes of marine life and discover new species. Moreover, the development of tourism in this region could create new job opportunities and stimulate economic growth, allowing people to fulfill their dreams of visiting the South Pole and witnessing its unique wildlife. Nevertheless, every breakthrough achieved by society comes with consequences. In this case, the detrimental effect of exploring the South Pole is the exacerbation of global warming. Human activity in this region would inevitably leave a carbon footprint, directly altering the environment. For instance, traveling to the South Pole would require air or marine transportation, such as cruise ships, which pollute the area with greenhouse gases. As a result, these gases would contribute to the warming of the environment, leading to the melting of ice and having a devastating impact on the landscape. Consequently, within the coming decades, this unique panorama may disappear, limiting the ability of scientists to study this natural area.In conclusion, the benefits of exploring the South Pole include the discovery of new landscapes and the opportunity to study how species adapt to this inhospitable environment. However, the mere act of entering this remote natural environment could potentially destroy it before any significant discoveries can be made. This highlights the need for responsible and sustainable exploration practices to preserve the integrity of this unique ecosystem.

In my opinion, economic progress is more important than other issues.Firstly, we must acknowledge that this is an economic world, where a person's quality of life is largely determined by their income. For instance, in a village with impoverished residents, people may be too preoccupied with making ends meet to consider other goals. This is why governments prioritize social and economic development. It is not uncommon for governments to lack the necessary funds to address environmental pollution and other issues.Secondly, while economic progress is essential for people's well-being, it can also lead to other problems. As income increases, it may require more resources to sustain the growth, which can give rise to new issues if not managed properly. Other types of progress, such as environmental and social progress, can only be achieved once economic progress has been secured and governments have sufficient funds.Overall, I believe that economic progress should take precedence over other types of progress. A better life is often rooted in financial stability, and the solutions to other problems often stem from a strong economy. In my view, economic progress is the foundation upon which other types of progress can be built.
555;Write about the following topic.Many parents today organise extra classes for their children after school and at the weekends.Do you feel that this is a worthwhile thing to do or do you feel children have enough education at school?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays educational institutions are equipped with devices that were unimaginable only a few years ago, which offer many opportunities to children to study every kind of subject. In other words, the technology introduced in schools helps many children to learn various subjects with different gadgets, such geography, art, maths by computers or history by means of audio-visual-techniques. However, I believe that children thanks to these appealing methods of learning have enough education and they need some time to unwind and experience their life with other activites.To begin with, apply children to extra classes at the weekends has become an issue of debate by many people. I hold firmly to the belief that children after schools need to dedicate their free time on sports. However, sports and other physical activities help young people to enhance their concentration, self-esteem and cognitive skills, social skills with their peer group. For example the most popular and suitable to children are sports with teams, such as football, basketball etc... where children could learn how to collaborate with other mates and the leadership skills gained in sports can help kids to excel in school, life and in the workplace, such as organising a good teamwork.On the other hand, there are few parents who argue that children need to attend extra classes at schools during the weekends. For instance, the world is still facing a global pandemic of covid-19, which caused many problems of attendency of students in many educational institutions due to various measures introduced. However this led many students to lazyness and reduction of methods of gaining knowledge, because it is widely believed that online lessons are not interactive as the lessons in presence. Moreover using continously a technological gadget for hours may cause distraction and negative mental effects. So the better solution for some people is to let their children do extra classes in presence in order to make up for the hours lost during the online lessons.To sum up, children need to experience different activities afterschool in order to have a good educational career. However some parents consider the extra classes an acceptable opportunity to not lose the methods of studying.;In recent years, educational institutions have been equipped with cutting-edge devices that offer a wide range of opportunities for children to study various subjects. The integration of technology in schools enables students to learn different subjects, such as geography, art, and mathematics, using computers, and history through audio-visual techniques. While I acknowledge the benefits of these innovative learning methods, I firmly believe that children need time to relax and engage in other activities outside of academics.The issue of whether children should attend extra classes on weekends has sparked a heated debate. In my opinion, children should dedicate their free time to sports and physical activities, which help improve their concentration, self-esteem, and cognitive and social skills. Team sports, such as football and basketball, are particularly beneficial as they teach children the value of collaboration, teamwork, and leadership. These skills can be transferred to academic and professional settings, enabling children to excel in various aspects of life.On the other hand, some parents argue that attending extra classes on weekends is necessary, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted attendance and learning patterns in many educational institutions. The shift to online lessons has led to concerns about student engagement, motivation, and the effectiveness of remote learning. Prolonged use of technological gadgets can also cause distractions and have negative effects on mental health. As a result, some parents believe that in-person extra classes can help make up for lost time and provide a more interactive and engaging learning experience.In conclusion, children need to experience a balance of activities outside of school to ensure a well-rounded educational career. While some parents view extra classes as a necessary supplement to traditional learning, I believe that sports, physical activities, and relaxation time are essential for children's overall development and academic success.
305;Write about the following topic.Many people use written language in a less formal and more relaxed way. Why? Does this development have advantages and disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, written language is used in comparatively more informal and relaxed way. I assume that it happens because of the need of making communication easier and faster. Without features of formal written language it is simplier to share your idea in a shorter period of time. This option is essential in a modern temp of life. This essay will cover both advantages and disadvantages of this development.The less formal and tense written language provides some pros. First of all, without formalization the process of communication requires less amount of time. Then letters consists of less number of symbols and can help to solve the discussed problem much faster. Moreover, this way of communication does not support formal borders between members of a dialogue. Then it is easier to come closer with the interlocutor and feel no pressure during the using of written language.On the other hand, development of making written language more informal and relaxed has some cons. Firstly, communication goes less respectful. Then interlocutors have almost no opportunity to pay a respect to each other. Formalized written language is significant in issue of social borders that can hihlight a paid respect. Secondly, sometimes the main gist of the letter goes unclear, because informal language is more relaxed. In these conditions, the quidity of the letter can be hidden with less formal features. If participants of the communication are not close, they will not understand each other correctly.In conclusion I would like to say that the process of using written language in a more informal way has both advantages and disadvantages. It can be revealed in different situations. That is why everyone should have their own opinion based on the information discussed in this essay.;In recent times, written language has evolved to become more informal and relaxed. This shift is likely driven by the need for faster and more efficient communication. Without the traditional features of formal written language, it is easier to convey ideas quickly and concisely. This adaptation is crucial in today's fast-paced world. This essay will examine both the benefits and drawbacks of this trend.The use of less formal and tense written language has several advantages. Firstly, it saves time, as communication can occur more quickly without the need for formalities. Additionally, informal writing tends to be more concise, using fewer words to convey the same message, which can facilitate faster problem-solving. Furthermore, this approach to communication breaks down formal barriers between individuals, making it easier to build rapport and feel more at ease when interacting with others.On the other hand, the trend towards more informal written language also has its drawbacks. One major con is that communication can become less respectful, as individuals may not have the opportunity to show deference to one another. Formalized written language plays a significant role in maintaining social boundaries and conveying respect. Moreover, the use of informal language can sometimes lead to ambiguity, as the main point of a message may be obscured by the lack of formal structure. If the parties involved in the communication are not familiar with each other, they may struggle to understand each other accurately.In conclusion, the shift towards using written language in a more informal way has both advantages and disadvantages, which can manifest in different situations. Therefore, it is essential for individuals to form their own opinions based on the information presented in this essay.
1161;Write about the following topic.More and more people are relying on the private car as their major means of transportation.Describe some of the problems over-reliance on cars can cause, and suggest at least one possible solution.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;That of trasportation is a question that have troubled all the people over the world, whatever it is the city or town in which they live. In the last years people used to relying on the private car to move around. . Although the possible reasons that persuaded people to use private cars, the problems that rise from their excessive use, such us traffic and pollution, are harsh consequences to be accepted. I think that an improvement of public trasportation and to incentive the use of ecological means of trasport like bicycle should be possible solution to those issues.Cars are considered the most confortable mean of trasport. In particular, if you have to move in a big cities like Milan. Indeed, means of trasports sometimes are late or full and also more unsafe. If you are a woman, for example, the use of public trasportation in some part of Italy is not safe mostly during the night hours. Another problem is that of comfort. If people use their car they can go whethever they want, when they want. If they have to spend more time in a place, they have not to be worried about the last bus they had to take to come back home.However, over-reliance of cars cause at least two big problmes: traffic and pollution. On the one hand, the problem of traffic will produce other issues such as anxiety and irritation. Indeed, if you have to go work in the morning and you live in a city like Rome you have to consider at least one hour spent in the traffic. Pollution is surely the most severe issue. Indeed, if all the people used to take a private car, then it is easely imaginable how much cars and fuel can be consumed daily. The two problems are linked, I want to underline, indeed, the noise pollution that derives from an intense traffic. It should be considered dangerous both for persons and animals.Two possible solutions to the problem of the over-reliance on cars are the following. Firstly, public trasportation should be improved. Indeed, if bus and tram were more safe and more confortable, then people would be more tent by their use. At least, they will solve the problem of traffic. On the other hand, I see the echologycal means of transport like bycicle as the new border to pass in order to save the world from pollution. One possible suggestion would be that of make cheaper the bycicle and also to give an economic subsidy to those people who decide to help the planet using them.In conclusion, I believe that the the use of private cars, because of the problems that it causes, should be discouraged. Two possible solutions rely on the improvement of public trasportation and on the incentive can be given to those using non-polluting means of trasport;The issue of transportation is a concern that affects people worldwide, regardless of the city or town they live in. In recent years, there has been a tendency for people to rely heavily on private cars for mobility. Although there are possible reasons that have led people to use private cars, the problems that arise from their excessive use, such as traffic congestion and pollution, are severe consequences that must be acknowledged. I believe that improving public transportation and incentivizing the use of eco-friendly modes of transport, like bicycles, could be a possible solution to these issues.Private cars are often considered the most comfortable means of transportation, especially in large cities like Milan. Public transportation, on the other hand, can be unreliable, with buses and trams sometimes running late or being overcrowded, and may also be less safe, particularly for women traveling alone at night in certain parts of Italy. Another issue is the flexibility that private cars offer, allowing individuals to travel wherever and whenever they want, without worrying about schedules or returning home.However, over-reliance on cars leads to at least two significant problems: traffic congestion and pollution. The problem of traffic can lead to other issues, such as increased anxiety and irritation, particularly for those who have to commute to work in heavily trafficked cities like Rome, where at least an hour can be spent in traffic. Pollution is an even more severe issue, with the collective use of private cars resulting in substantial daily consumption of fuel and vehicles. The two problems are interconnected, and it's essential to highlight the danger of noise pollution caused by heavy traffic, which poses a threat to both humans and animals.Two possible solutions to the problem of over-reliance on cars are improving public transportation and promoting eco-friendly modes of transport. Firstly, if buses and trams were made safer and more comfortable, people would be more inclined to use them, which would help alleviate traffic congestion. On the other hand, I believe that eco-friendly modes of transport, such as bicycles, are a crucial step towards reducing pollution. A possible suggestion would be to make bicycles more affordable and offer economic incentives to those who choose to use them, thereby contributing to a more sustainable environment.In conclusion, I believe that the use of private cars, due to the problems it causes, should be discouraged. Two possible solutions lie in improving public transportation and incentivizing the use of non-polluting modes of transport. By adopting these measures, we can work towards mitigating the negative consequences of excessive car use and fostering a more environmentally friendly transportation system.
1051;"Write about the following topic.Most people have forgotten the meaning behind traditional or religious festivals; during festival periods, people nowadays only want to enjoy themselves.To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.";"In recent years, it is argued that many people have lost track of the meaning behind traditional and religious celebrations; Now, people seem to treat these celebrations as another holiday break. The following essay will fully endorse the statement and examine the reasons behind it.Firstly, there are several reasons why people forgot about the message behind celebrations. One of the most significant one is globalisation. As people start connecting with each other through social media worldwide, many people are too distracted with the latest trends and updates. A study from Yales University mentioned that 60% of the population on earth do not persuit the stories about their traditional roots and background. Hence, they do not celebrate festive or cultural events meaningfully. Another important reason is broken families. People who experienced a tough childhood without a male or female parent are not capable of understanding their own traditions and values. Therefore, they do not grasp the concept of cultural celebrations.Moreover, there are also cons to this arguments as people just want to take a holiday break. Although people may argue that it is important to remember the intention behind diverse celebrations, others just want to use the day for self-fulfillment purposes. For example, people would organise a party and invite friends over to their house so they can have a good time. Another argument that people only want enjoyment during festive periods is work-stress related illnesses. The majority of middle class workers are hardworking and dedicated to their job. However, the period of time for holiday breaks are significantly short and they just want to use the celebration events to rest at home. Despite the fact that they are neglecting their duties to demonstrate the meaning behind these celebrations to the younger generations, they also have a right to take care of themselves mentally and physically before others.In conclusion, there are both sides of the argument on why people think others have forgotten the meaning behind event celebrations and why this is not neccesarily true all the time. Personally, I agree that people should always find the meaning behind these celebrations in order to understand themselves better.";The true significance of traditional and religious celebrations appears to have been lost on many individuals in recent years. Instead of honoring the original purpose and meaning behind these events, they are often treated as mere holiday breaks. This essay aims to explore and support the notion that people have forgotten the importance of these celebrations, and examine the underlying reasons for this phenomenon.There are several factors that contribute to the erosion of meaningful celebration. One major reason is globalization, which has led to a surge in social media usage and a subsequent distraction from cultural roots. A study by Yale University found that  approximately 60% of the global population is disconnected from their traditional heritage and background, resulting in a lack of meaningful participation in festive and cultural events. Another significant factor is the breakdown of family structures, where individuals who have experienced difficult childhoods without a stable family environment often struggle to understand and appreciate their own cultural traditions and values.On the other hand, some argue that people simply want to use celebrations as an opportunity for self-indulgence and relaxation. For instance, many individuals organize parties and gatherings with friends, prioritizing enjoyment over the original intention behind the celebration. Furthermore, the pressures of modern work life can lead to stress-related illnesses, causing people to crave rest and relaxation during holiday periods. While this may lead to a neglect of duties to pass on cultural values to younger generations, it is also essential to acknowledge the importance of mental and physical self-care.In conclusion, the debate surrounding the perceived loss of meaning behind celebrations is multifaceted. While some argue that people have forgotten the significance of these events, others see them as opportunities for rest and enjoyment. Personally, I believe that it is essential to reconnect with the true meaning and purpose of celebrations, as this can foster a deeper understanding of oneself and one's cultural heritage. By doing so, individuals can work to preserve and pass on valuable traditions and values to future generations.

Others, however, think that music can have a negative influence on both.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Music is the moonlight in the gloomy night of life.It is the universal language of mankind.There are mixed opinions about music on whether it is advantageous or not to individuals and society.This essay will discuss about pros and cons of music being part of our life.Some people have a perception that playing or listening to music is not beneficial in any manner. They feel music separates a person from socializing and that it is a form of addiction and distraction.Especially, parents feel that their child's concentration is impacted while multitasking with music and studies.For extroverts its a sort of discomfort or hindrance.Few extroverts feel better to share their feelings and difficulties with others than staying alone and listening to a song. Few recorded instances has suggested that sad music inculcates negative thoughts and aggression while in depression.On the other hand, there are people who think that music having a negative effect on individual and society is completely preposterous.They feel that tunes produces a kind of pleasure which human nature cannot do without.Music is a form of expression of feelings rather than being a hindrance.It greatly helps people to overcome their hurdles.Soothing and melodious music gives a refreshing effect.Jazz and Pop music facilitates society to come together and dance.Concerrts helps certain groups to spend time for relaxation from their busy schedule.Not only that, singing or playing instruments is a form of expression of their feelings.The essay argued that though music is considered to be a distraction , it is a form of rejuvenation to both society and individuals of all age groups.;Music is the beacon of hope in the darkest nights of life, serving as a universal language that transcends cultural and societal boundaries. While opinions about its impact on individuals and society are divided, the following discussion will delve into the advantages and disadvantages of music as an integral part of our lives.Some individuals perceive music as a hindrance, rather than a benefit, believing that it isolates people from social interactions and can be addictive and distracting. Parents, in particular, are concerned that their children's ability to concentrate is compromised when they multitask with music and studies. For extroverted personalities, music can be a source of discomfort or an obstacle, as they prefer to share their feelings and difficulties with others rather than seeking solace in solitude and song. Furthermore, there have been instances where sad music has been linked to the cultivation of negative thoughts and aggression in individuals suffering from depression.On the other hand, there are those who dismiss the notion that music has a detrimental effect on individuals and society as absurd. They argue that music produces a unique pleasure that is essential to human nature, and that it serves as a means of expressing emotions rather than a hindrance. Music has the power to help people overcome challenges and provides a refreshing escape through its soothing melodies. Genres like jazz and pop bring people together, fostering a sense of community and social bonding through dance. Concerts offer a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of daily life, allowing individuals to unwind and express themselves through music. Whether through singing or playing instruments, music is a vital outlet for emotional expression.In conclusion, although music is often viewed as a distraction, it is, in fact, a source of rejuvenation for both individuals and society as a whole, catering to all age groups. The essay ultimately argues that music plays a positive role in our lives, offering numerous benefits that outweigh its perceived drawbacks.
587;Write about the following topic.Nowadays, sports is a big business with high earnings for professional sports people and companies involved both financially and other ways. Is this a positive or negative development for sports?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is argued that using mobile devices is as antisocial as smoking and that in certain areas smoking has been forbidden so mobile devices should be prohibited as well. I strongly disagree with this statement because this would not solve the initial problem and could turn out expensive as well.Firstly, banning mobile devices from certain places would be exagerated. This is because smoking actually damages your body, while the use of mobile phones is comparatively harmless. For example, a recent research found out that the risk of lung cancer grows by 0,02% with every cigarette, while high screen time has less damaging side effects like the loss of concentration. Altough the use of mobile phones is sometimes antisocial, I think that we should concentrate on the origins of this problem than simply prohibit it in certain areas.Secondly, banning mobile devices would have a regulatory side effect which could be expensive. The government would have to decide on new laws as well as implement them. Furthermore, it would be no easy task for the police to control these rules in an efficient way. As a result, police would struggle with a high workload. Admittely, I have enough faith in our legal system and I am sure that they could manage it but I think that we have more prescious und urgent tasks to concentrate on.In conclusion, I strongly disagree with banning mobile devices in certain areas. However, I admit that we use our phones too much which sometimes leads to antisocial behaviour. Nevertheless, prohibiting the phones in certain areas would not solve this problem and could as well be expensive for the government.;I strongly disagree with the notion that using mobile devices is as antisocial as smoking and therefore should be prohibited in certain areas. This approach would not only fail to address the underlying issue but also prove to be costly.Firstly, the comparison between smoking and mobile device usage is misplaced. Smoking has well-documented harmful effects on physical health, such as significantly increasing the risk of lung cancer. In contrast, excessive mobile phone use, while potentially contributing to antisocial behavior and issues like decreased concentration, does not have comparably severe health consequences. Instead of outright banning mobile devices, it would be more productive to address the roots of antisocial behavior associated with their use.Secondly, enforcing a ban on mobile devices would come with significant regulatory challenges and expenses. The process of establishing and implementing new laws, as well as the subsequent enforcement, would be complex and burdensome for law enforcement agencies. This would lead to an increased workload for police, diverting resources away from more critical tasks. While I have confidence in the capabilities of our legal system, I believe that our efforts and resources should be prioritized towards more pressing issues.In conclusion, prohibiting mobile devices in certain areas is not a viable solution to the problem of antisocial behavior associated with their use. Acknowledging that excessive phone use can lead to antisocial behavior, the focus should be on addressing the underlying causes rather than imposing bans, which would likely prove ineffective and costly for the government.
1133;Write about the following topic.People in all modern societies use drugs, but today's youth are experimenting with both legal and illegal drugs, and at an increasingly early age. Some sociologists claim that parents and other members of society often set a bad example.Discuss the causes and some effects of widespread drug use by young people in modern day society. Make any recommendations you feel are necessary to help fight youth drug abuse.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The use of drugs has been a warning habit in modern day society. In some research, it shows that households are losing their financing easily due to the fact that one of the parents has been addicted to drugs. Although there are some drugs which were approved by the government to be used moderately, yet some people are using these drugs heavily.This has drawn the attention of the youth either by a drug addict parent or a friend. Moreover, the number of youngsters taking drugs has increased dramatically throughout the years as there are people who provide these drugs in the black market. This critical issue has caused serious issues both socially and mentally.The social and mental impact of using drugs by the youngsters have damaged the educational progress, the social participation such as family and friends gatherings. Additionally, lack of stamina, weight loss, and loss of appetite are key factors of excessive use of drugs.There is a number of contributing elements to the phenomena. One of these elements is the sense of belonging to a group. Since humans are social animals, young people want to have the feeling of being accepted and loved, and this can be sensible when it comes to a group of friends. Therefore, once someone introduces a drug, the rest of the group will try, and if one says no, then they will be rejected. However, this rejection can be helping to solve this alarming issue.The solution is to find a way to distinguish the types of drugs and legalize the ones that do not harm greatly and prepare in parallel the better ways to control the consumption of drugs.;The use of drugs has become a disturbing trend in today's society. Research has shown that many families are struggling financially due to a parent's drug addiction. While some drugs have been approved by the government for moderate use, many individuals are abusing them heavily. This has not only caught the attention of young people through addicted parents or friends but has also led to a significant increase in the number of youngsters using drugs, largely due to the availability of these substances on the black market.The consequences of drug use among young people are severe, both socially and mentally. It hampers educational progress and social participation, including interactions with family and friends. Furthermore, excessive drug use can lead to physical issues such as lack of stamina, weight loss, and loss of appetite.Several factors contribute to this phenomenon, one of which is the desire for social belonging. As social creatures, young individuals seek acceptance and love, often through friendship groups. If drugs are introduced within such a group, peer pressure can lead to experimentation, with the risk of rejection for those who refuse. However, recognizing and addressing this aspect of social rejection can be a crucial step in resolving this critical issue.To combat this, a potential solution involves differentiating between drug types and legalizing those that pose minimal harm, while simultaneously developing more effective methods to regulate drug consumption. This multifaceted approach could help mitigate the negative impacts of drug use in society.

Do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"In development countries they must allow works for people who have skills and experience employees from poor countries. I agree with this point of view because everyone they should have a chance. There were a opportunities and benefits.The first point, I would like to make is that there were a great opportunities for both rich countries and people who came from poor areas. When people thinking to transfer abroad there were many reason but the most important when they want a chance to show of there craft and ability. Such as, Indian people they travelled many areas and they give them a lot of discoveries and skills; moreover, the rich countries need some people to help to make their country better place for living. For example, I have read an article in the newspaper they talked about development countries like UK, US and Arabic countries they need those people to improve their economy and life.The second point, I will clarify is that there were many benefits when this countries allow jobs for those. They will be equality for all ;furthermore, there will be a improvement in living. For instance, I have saw a T.V decomontry they say "" In United States there are a equality and improvement in live between people they came from Africaand citizens they help them to have good education, skills and experience also they contribute the US economy to growth "".Finally, we can say that there were a opportunities and benefits for both sides. I am with this to have good life for all. I hope in the future poor countries they can take benefits from those people and developed their country to came better than now .";In developing countries, it is essential to provide job opportunities for skilled and experienced employees from poorer nations. I agree with this perspective because everyone deserves a chance to succeed. This approach offers numerous opportunities and benefits for all parties involved.Firstly, I'd like to highlight that there are significant opportunities for both developed countries and individuals from poorer areas. When people consider moving abroad, they often do so to showcase their skills and abilities. For instance, Indian professionals have traveled to various countries, sharing their discoveries and expertise. Meanwhile, developed countries like the UK, US, and Arab nations need skilled workers to improve their economies and quality of life. According to a newspaper article I read, these countries require international talent to drive economic growth and enhance living standards.Secondly, allowing job opportunities for individuals from poorer countries brings numerous benefits. It promotes equality for all, leading to improved living conditions. For example, a TV documentary I watched highlighted the equality and enhanced living standards among African immigrants in the United States. The documentary showed how American citizens helped these individuals access quality education, skills, and experience, which in turn contributed to the growth of the US economy.In conclusion, there are undeniable opportunities and benefits for both developed and developing countries when job opportunities are provided to skilled and experienced employees from poorer nations. I firmly believe that this approach can lead to a better life for all. I hope that in the future, poorer countries can capitalize on the skills and expertise of their citizens who have worked abroad, using this experience to develop their home countries and improve their current situation.
973;Write about the following topic.Some organisations believe that their employees should dress smartly. Others value quality of work above appearance.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Manners in the workplace have always been a topic that is discussed by many people as it is essential to know how we should behave in such a formal environment. Some companies give the opinion that their workers should have a smart look while others consider the attitude toward the job more important.To my mind, appearance should not the only thing to be considered. We can dress smartly and impress others, but it is only the first impression. Therefore, productivity, quality of work, and the way we are responsible for our tasks are things that make us outstanding workers. Moreover, it is obvious that the success of one company does not depend on how its employees dress but on how it is organized.In spite of the fact that dressing does not play a key role in the value of a worker, a neat and intelligent appearance still gives us significant benefits. I always suggest that one should dress suitably in different situations. In fact, it is not crucial for an organization to ask their employees to dress formally, but a set of smart casual clothes is something that we should wear when it comes to the working environment. It is because that wearing politely shows how we respect our jobs, our employers, and even our workmates. In some cases, a company's professionalism can be seen through the way its workers wear.To sum up, dressing smartly is not the best and only thing that one worker can do to have better performance. However, having a good appearance is something that great employees would do since it can be considered as their respect for the jobs.;The importance of manners in the workplace is a widely discussed topic, as it is crucial to understand how to conduct oneself in a formal environment. While some companies emphasize the need for employees to present themselves in a professional and polished manner, others prioritize a positive attitude towards one's job. In my opinion, appearance should not be the sole consideration. Although dressing well can make a good first impression, it is the quality of work, productivity, and sense of responsibility that truly make an employee stand out. Moreover, it is evident that a company's success is not determined by its employees' attire, but rather by its organizational structure.While dressing may not be a decisive factor in evaluating an employee's worth, presenting oneself in a neat and intelligent manner still has its advantages. I firmly believe that dressing appropriately for different situations is essential. It is not necessary for companies to enforce a formal dress code, but wearing smart casual attire in the workplace is a sign of respect for one's job, employer, and colleagues. In some instances, a company's professionalism can be reflected in the way its employees dress.In conclusion, dressing well is not the only factor that contributes to an employee's performance. However, maintaining a good appearance is a trait of exceptional employees, as it demonstrates their respect for their job and their commitment to making a positive impression. By presenting oneself in a professional and respectful manner, employees can show their dedication to their work and their organization, which can have a positive impact on their overall performance and the company's success.
495;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that it is good to share as much information as possible in scientific research, business and the academic world. Others believe that some information is too important or too valuable to be shared freely.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In recent years, some people believe that it is good to share information about scientific research, business and the academic field to many people. Others reckon that such informations are too important or too valuable to be share for free. Here are discussions of the statements and my opinion.By development of the technology, people can more likely to access to valuable information such as experimental results and interviewing results of citizens than before. Some people use it for their academic interests or for the business strategies, so that people believe that such information contribute to companies profits or individuals' advantages in academic. For example, many of the medical students read dissertation of diseases, which were written in the past. By reading and using the scientific information students will become excellent professionals.On the other hand, people can access informations from any countries via internet. Recently, increasing the cyber crimes is the serious problem all over the world. Therefore some people reckon that it is too risky to share valuable informations. If information on valuable national research results is leaked, the country would had enormous loss for the economy.To sum up ,sharing as much informations as possible is useful for the everyone to improve their academic skills and contribute to their companies, while easier access to every aspects of informations might bring disadvantages such as information leakage or cybercrime. In my opinion, I mostly agree with it is good to share information, but I believe the source of information needs to be careful not to misuse the sources.;In recent years, there has been a growing debate about the benefits and drawbacks of sharing information related to scientific research, business, and academia with the general public. While some individuals believe that disseminating such information is beneficial, others argue that it is too valuable or sensitive to be shared freely. This discussion will examine both perspectives and present my opinion on the matter.The advancement of technology has made it easier for people to access valuable information, such as experimental results and research findings, than ever before. Many individuals utilize this information to further their academic interests or inform business strategies, which can contribute to a company's profits or an individual's academic success. For instance, medical students often read and learn from dissertations on various diseases written by previous researchers, enabling them to become skilled professionals in their field.On the other hand, the internet has made it possible for people to access information from anywhere in the world. However, the rising incidence of cybercrime has become a significant concern globally. As a result, some people believe that sharing valuable information is too risky, as leaking sensitive national research results could lead to substantial economic losses for a country.In conclusion, sharing information as widely as possible can be beneficial for improving academic skills and contributing to business success. Nevertheless, easy access to all types of information also carries disadvantages, such as the risk of information leakage or cybercrime. In my opinion, I largely agree that sharing information is beneficial, but I also believe that it is crucial to carefully vet the sources of information to prevent misuse. By being mindful of the potential risks and taking steps to mitigate them, we can harness the benefits of information sharing while minimizing its drawbacks.
273;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that one of the best ways to solve environmental problem is to increase the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Environmental problems are the biggest issue that people have to concern and by product form fossil fuels is one of causes. Someone think one way that can reduce result from fuels is sale car fuels in higher price. In my opinion, I disagree with this because highly price of oil leads to other problems such as financial problem and impact to food price, moreover, we can heal their environment by other ways.The negative effects of increasing the cost of vehciles fuels are improtant to human life. The significant points is price of basic requirements, for instance, foods and medicines which have to transportation by trucks that use oil fuels for movement. The expensive fuels increase business costs, so their products price are rising up. Futhermore, social problems follow by financial problems. When poor people do not have money but they still hunger, they will steal some food or water this situation roads to social problems.Other ways to reduce environment problems, the causes of this problem are not only fossil fuel but also agricultural or industial aspect which we have to focus on. Intustial areas are the top areas that make lot of pollutions such as air pollution, water pollution from thier procesing and chemical pollution which they use during process. Those of them lead to many problems and effect to qulity of human life. Moveover agricultural areas, there produce many of gas which result to global warming.In conclusion, the increasing car fuels might reduce some of environmental problems but also have drawback to population life. We should to chooce other ways to protect enviromant without effect to our life.;Environmental issues are a major concern for people worldwide, and the byproducts of fossil fuels are a significant contributing factor. Some people believe that increasing the price of car fuels can help mitigate the effects of fuel consumption. However, I disagree with this approach because higher oil prices lead to other problems, such as financial difficulties and increased food prices. Moreover, there are alternative ways to address environmental concerns without resorting to price hikes.The negative consequences of increasing vehicle fuel costs have significant implications for human life. A notable example is the impact on the prices of basic necessities like food and medicine, which rely on transportation by trucks that use oil fuels. As fuel costs rise, businesses are forced to increase their prices, leading to higher product costs. Furthermore, financial problems can lead to social issues, as impoverished individuals may turn to crime, such as theft, to meet their basic needs, ultimately contributing to social problems.Instead of relying on price increases, we should explore other ways to reduce environmental problems. The causes of these issues are multifaceted, involving not only fossil fuels but also agricultural and industrial aspects. Industrial areas are significant contributors to pollution, including air, water, and chemical pollution, which arise from their processing and manufacturing activities. These pollutants have far-reaching consequences, affecting the quality of human life. Additionally, agricultural areas produce substantial amounts of greenhouse gases, contributing to global warming.In conclusion, while increasing car fuel prices might alleviate some environmental concerns, it also has significant drawbacks for the population. Therefore, we should explore alternative solutions to protect the environment without compromising our standard of living.
135;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that school children should not be given homework by their teachers, whereas others argue that homework plays an important role in the education of children.Discuss both of these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The issue that whether teachers should assign homework or not has attracted great attention recently.Some people believe that homework is a good way to consolidate students'learning effect.However,others argue that homework exerts huge pressure on students,which is bad for their long-term development.As for me,appropriate homework should be seen as the better choice.I will explain my idea from two aspects.Firstly,homework could examine student's learning results.After teaching the basic content,giving some homework is important to consolidate the knowledge.As an old saying goes,practice makes things perfect.Only doing many practices,can we master the knowledge proficiently.There is an example.In my teaching experiences,I found the students finishing their homework better would achieve higher scores in final examination,while those who couldn't finish their ordinary homework would gain lower grades in any examination.And my translation skills were also improved by practicing the homework from my guiders who gave the targeted examination to me.Secondly,too much homework will cause so many negative effects,such as making students tired very much,causing their depressed mood and their bored emotion.For example,my brother's daughter always suffered from the huge homework which was assigned by his Chinese teacher.She once complained with me that everyday she felt tired and bored after finishing Chinese teacher's assignments.So appropriate homework is reasonable for most students and those ideas that the more homework,the better students' scores ,are wrong to certain extent.Sometimes huge homework is the reason that why some students'scores are reduced.In sum,removing homework is not an ideal option for student's improvement in learning,and reasonable homework provides us a better way to deal with the problem.That is to say,we should strike a balance between assigning homework and removing homework.;"The debate about whether teachers should assign homework has recently garnered significant attention. Some individuals believe that homework is an effective way to reinforce students' learning outcomes. On the other hand, others argue that homework imposes substantial pressure on students, which can be detrimental to their long-term development. In my opinion, assigning appropriate homework is the better choice. I will explain my perspective from two aspects.Firstly, homework serves as a means to assess students' learning results. After teaching the fundamental content, assigning homework is crucial to solidify the knowledge. As the old adage goes, ""practice makes perfect."" Only through extensive practice can we master the knowledge proficiently. For instance, based on my teaching experiences, I observed that students who consistently completed their homework achieved higher scores in the final examination, whereas those who struggled to finish their regular homework tended to perform poorly in exams. Moreover, my translation skills improved significantly through practicing homework assigned by my instructors, who provided me with targeted exercises.Secondly, excessive homework can have numerous negative consequences, such as causing students to feel exhausted, leading to depressed moods and boredom. For example, my brother's daughter often suffered from the overwhelming homework assigned by her Chinese teacher. She once complained to me that she felt tired and bored every day after completing her teacher's assignments. Therefore, assigning appropriate homework is reasonable for most students, and the notion that more homework leads to better scores is incorrect to a certain extent. In some cases, excessive homework can even be the reason why some students' scores decline.In conclusion, eliminating homework is not an ideal solution for improving students' learning outcomes. Instead, reasonable homework provides a better approach to address the issue. This means striking a balance between assigning homework and not assigning it. By finding this balance, we can create a more effective and sustainable learning environment for students."
525;Write about the following topic.Some people believe that teaching children at home is best for a child's development while others think that it is important for children to go to school.Discuss the advantages of both methods and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In regards to the notion 'it is important for children to go to school', there are two contrasting opinions of supporting it and also disagreeing with it. Schools are conceptually thought to be essential and compulsory for many parents while others may not despite of what the society says.There are people who suggest that going to school is indeed necessary for children and students as it enables them to develop social ability and make friends which will ultimately be useful in the future. Attending school, a microsom of society, itself already teaches young students how to interact with other people ouside of family tree. Those who did not attend school when they were young may have severly low EQ or lacking interaction ability. For instance, an adult who was studying at home might not know how to respect and share objects with others. By being enrolled in a school, children can make remarkable childhood memories that may help them in the future when they are in a slump or depression.On the other hand, some people may disagree to this notion as they think studying at home is far more effective. Their argument might be that going to school would be a waste of time as children usually play around at school. Teaching children can be much more efficient as transportation time and playing time can be eliminatied by not going to school. Furthermore, as children do not have to go out, there will not be any conflicts on bullying or fight with friends. They will not fall onto deviation such as smoking, drinking et cetera which are usually encountered at school due to bad friends. Also, money can be saved by teaching at home as uniforms, for example, do not have to purchased.All in all, although young students might have number of advantages by not going to school, it is nevertheless more important to attend school in a daily basis to improve their social ability and interaction with other people.;"The idea that ""it is essential for children to attend school"" is a topic of debate, with two opposing viewpoints: one that supports it and another that disagrees. While many parents believe that schooling is vital and compulsory, others disagree, despite societal expectations.Proponents of attending school argue that it is necessary for children's development, as it enables them to cultivate social skills and form friendships that will benefit them in the future. Schooling provides a miniature society where young students learn to interact with people outside of their family, teaching them valuable social skills. Those who did not attend school may struggle with low emotional intelligence (EQ) and poor interaction abilities. For example, a person who was homeschooled may not know how to respect and share with others. Attending school allows children to create lasting childhood memories that can help them cope with future challenges, such as depression.On the other hand, some people disagree with this notion, believing that homeschooling is more effective. They argue that attending school can be a waste of time, as children often spend more time playing than learning. Homeschooling can be more efficient, as it eliminates transportation and playtime, allowing for more focused learning. Additionally, homeschooling reduces the risk of conflicts, bullying, and exposure to negative influences, such as smoking and drinking, which can be prevalent in school environments. Furthermore, homeschooling can be cost-effective, as expenses like uniforms can be avoided.In conclusion, although there may be advantages to not attending school, it is still more important for children to attend school regularly to develop their social skills and interact with others. The benefits of socialization and interaction outweigh the potential drawbacks, making daily school attendance a crucial aspect of a child's development."
323;Write about the following topic.Some people believe women are better leaders than men. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;It is argued by some individuals that men aren't skilled enough as women in regard to leadership. This essay disagrees with the given statement as leadership skills are not depending on gender but are strongly related to people's personality and work experience.The role of a leader should not be stereotyped according to gender, for example, women might be considered more powerful than men because they could normally appear more organised and perfectionist. Indeed, several studies concerning leadership and the role of the leader, have demonstrated that some people have innate attitudes of a leader regardless of their gender. Some of those attitudes are related to active listening, emotional intelligence skills and great communication abilities. Thus, if effectively developed and fostered, those skills can support individuals to achieve higher roles in leadership and management.In the same way, the working experience also plays a crucial role in determining and further developing leadership skills. For example, a large number of women are still renouncing to their career paths in order to care for their families. Indeed, most of the women, apply for part-time roles which do not offer the opportunity to achieve a leadership role despite their abilities. For this reason, is difficult to affirm if women are better than men in leadership.To conclude, the role of a leader is shaped by innate characteristics and people's personalities regardless of their gender. Moreover, the poor presence of women employed in leadership roles does not create pieces of evidence to support such a point of view.;The notion that men are less skilled than women in leadership is a claim made by some, but this essay contends that leadership abilities are not inherently tied to gender. Instead, they are closely linked to an individual's personality and professional experience. The concept of leadership should not be confined to gender stereotypes, where women are perceived as more powerful or capable due to traits like being organized and perfectionistic. Research on leadership roles has shown that certain innate leadership attributes, such as active listening, emotional intelligence, and strong communication skills, are present in individuals regardless of their gender. When nurtured and developed, these skills can propel individuals into higher leadership and management positions.Similarly, work experience plays a vital role in shaping and refining leadership skills. For instance, many women still prioritize family care over their career advancement, often opting for part-time jobs that lack the potential for leadership roles, despite their capabilities. This makes it challenging to definitively state that women are better leaders than men.In conclusion, leadership roles are defined by inherent characteristics and personal traits that are independent of gender. Furthermore, the underrepresentation of women in leadership positions does not serve as evidence to support the idea that one gender is inherently more suited to leadership than the other.
247;Write about the following topic.Some people feel that manufacturers and supermarkets have the responsibility to reduce the amount of packaging of goods. Others argue that customers should avoid buying goods with a lot of packaging. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Packing of goods has become a noticeable issue nowadays, especially in terms of environmental concerns and sustainable development of society. In order to reduce the amount of packaging, some people believe that manufacturers and supermarkets are more responsible for taking measures, while others insist that customers play a more critical role in reality. In my view, the effort needs to be made by the supplier and the consumer both to guarantee the achievement of the goal.On the one hand, the problem of over-packaging is often caused by commercial strategy. The supplier attempts to use beautiful packaging to make their products more attractive to customers. It is fairly easy to imagine that people would be more likely to choose a product decorated gorgeously than the same one with a plain appearance provided that there is thus no significant increase in price. Following that, producers would try to make every effort to obtain more competitive packaging for their products, which probably leads to excessive use of the wrap. Therefore, it is undoubtedly the duty of the producer to partake in reducing the amount of over-packaging by finding another way to improve the competitiveness of their products instead of merely attaching more value to their appearance.On the other hand, the behaviors of customers give rise to over-packaging as well. The more attention that people will pay to the appearance of goods, the more encouraged producers will be to exert themselves on wrapping. Moreover, the public awareness about the harmful influence of over-packaging is also profound in decreasing the amount of packaging. As customers take the problems caused by over-packaging into account, they would be more willing to purchase the goods with less packaging, which is a highly practical way to prevent producers from wrapping unduly.In conclusion, it is clear that suppliers and customers both are responsible for the trend of over-packaging. Therefore, the success of altering the situation needs the participation of them both.;The issue of excessive packaging has become a significant concern in today's society, particularly in terms of environmental impact and sustainable development. While some argue that manufacturers and supermarkets bear the primary responsibility for reducing packaging, others believe that customers play a crucial role. In my opinion, the joint effort of both suppliers and consumers is essential to achieve the goal of minimizing packaging.On one hand, the problem of over-packaging is often driven by commercial strategies. Suppliers use attractive packaging to make their products more appealing to customers, as people are more likely to choose a product with a visually appealing design over a plain one, provided the price remains competitive. Consequently, producers strive to create more competitive packaging, leading to excessive packaging. Therefore, it is the producer's responsibility to reduce over-packaging by exploring alternative methods to enhance their products' competitiveness, rather than relying solely on appearance.On the other hand, customer behavior also contributes to over-packaging. The more emphasis customers place on a product's appearance, the more encouraged producers are to focus on elaborate packaging. Furthermore, raising public awareness about the harmful effects of over-packaging can significantly decrease packaging amounts. As customers consider the problems caused by excessive packaging, they are more likely to purchase goods with minimal packaging, which in turn discourages producers from using excessive packaging.In conclusion, it is evident that both suppliers and customers are responsible for the trend of over-packaging. Therefore, the successful reduction of packaging requires the collective participation of both parties. By working together, suppliers and consumers can effectively address the issue of excessive packaging and promote a more sustainable future.

Others, however, think that change is always a good thing.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people rather doing the same things over and over avoiding change, meanwhile others consider change as a positive thing. Some people are probably afraid of change and for this reason they prefer staying in the confort zone because it's something familiar. On the other hand, others believe that change is a good opportunity to grow and discover new things.Changing it's not for everybody, because there are people that doesn't like it, so they try to avoid it. Spending the whole life doing the same thing is not as bad as change for some people. This is probably linked to the fact that sometime change is something unknown. So, sometime people prefere to stay in their confort zone because even if it's not the best at least is something familiar. For example, people that hate their jobs but are stuck with it, is because they're too afraid to change it and land in a worse place or position. So they rather stay in that place because they're too afraid to lose it and end up worse. I believe that this is an understandable and common reason around people, however i believe that change can give more chances for improvement.Other people believes that change is always a positive thing. Changing is an opportunity to grow and discover new things, It's a chance to achieve something better and improve. There are people who doesn't like to be in the same place (phisically, economically or emotionally) and prefer changing. For instance, going to a new country because the idea of living in the same place forever is not charming enough, so find out new places to see, and places to feel confortable ,emotionally and economically for instance, is something that only people who are hungry enough of change would do it. I believe that sometime it's better risk it than live the same life everyday.In conclusion, the preference about change depends on people and wheter is beneficial or not depends on the different point of views and situations. I think, that change is important, everything change even if try to avoid it. So, it's better embrace it because no matter how things go it will leave you either with an experiece or with a lesson. So, in my opinion change is a good thing.;While some individuals prefer to stick to their routines and avoid change, others view it as a positive and exciting experience. The fear of change can be overwhelming for some people, causing them to prefer the comfort and familiarity of their current situation. On the other hand, others believe that change presents an opportunity for growth, discovery, and improvement.For some people, the idea of change is daunting, and they may try to avoid it altogether. They may feel that spending their entire life doing the same thing is not so bad, especially when compared to the uncertainty of change. This fear of the unknown can lead people to stay in their comfort zones, even if it's not ideal, simply because it's familiar. For instance, someone who hates their job may be too afraid to change it, fearing that they might end up in a worse situation. This fear of loss can be a common and understandable reason for people to resist change.However, I believe that change can provide opportunities for improvement and growth. Some people view change as a positive force, allowing them to discover new things, achieve better outcomes, and improve their lives. These individuals are often eager to explore new places, experiences, and challenges, whether it's physically, economically, or emotionally. For example, moving to a new country can be a thrilling experience for those who crave change and are willing to take risks. I think that sometimes it's better to take a chance and risk change rather than living the same life every day.In conclusion, people's preferences regarding change depend on their individual perspectives and situations. While some may view change as beneficial, others may see it as a threat. I believe that change is inevitable and essential, as everything in life is constantly changing. Therefore, it's better to embrace change, as it can lead to valuable experiences and lessons, regardless of the outcome. In my opinion, change is a positive and necessary aspect of life.
149;Write about the following topic.Some people think living in big cities is bad for people’s health.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;In the past decades, the rise of urbanization has brought trends of moving into the cities. While some people believe that the availability of resources and welfare in metropolises can outweigh the unhealthy environment, I strongly believe that the fancy infrastructures come in exchange for health sacrifice.To begin with, most megacities are overpopulated. With scarce resources and higher demands in every aspect, products and services received in these bustling locations usually come at a higher price, lower quality and longer waiting time. For example, it could take up to weeks or months to queue up for non-urgent medical services while it takes only a few days or even without booking in non-busy areas. Moreover, the nature of crowded areas accelerates the spreading of transmittable diseases during the pandemic.Another undeniable health factor for those residing in cities is pollution. Most cities come with traffic issues where there are exceeding amounts of cars which create air pollution. It is proved that, in long term, smog in the air could result in respiratory diseases such as lung cancer. Furthermore, the number of the city's population is equal to the extremely large amount of waste and without an appropriate waste management system, it could lead to several more problems. One of them is pests such as mice and bugs which are the perfect mediums for severe diseases such as rabies.All in all, urbanization has tremendous benefits to human society as a whole and is unavoidable in the present context. Thus, governments should focus on addressing these issues to ensure the sustainable progress of cities and the citizens' quality of life.;Over the past few decades, urbanization has led to a significant migration of people to cities. Although some individuals believe that the advantages of living in metropolises, such as access to resources and welfare, outweigh the negative effects on health, I firmly disagree. In my opinion, the modern infrastructure that cities offer comes at the cost of compromised health.Firstly, most megacities are plagued by overpopulation, resulting in scarce resources and high demand for products and services. Consequently, the quality of these services is often lower, and the prices are higher. For instance, waiting times for non-urgent medical services can be weeks or even months, whereas in less crowded areas, appointments can be scheduled within a few days or even without prior booking. Moreover, the crowded environment of cities facilitates the rapid spread of infectious diseases, particularly during pandemics.Another significant health concern for city dwellers is pollution. The high volume of vehicles in cities leads to severe traffic congestion, which in turn, causes air pollution. It has been proven that long-term exposure to smog can lead to respiratory issues, such as lung cancer. Additionally, the large population of cities generates an enormous amount of waste, and without a proper waste management system, this can lead to numerous problems, including the proliferation of pests like mice and bugs, which can transmit severe diseases like rabies.In conclusion, while urbanization has numerous benefits for society and is an unavoidable phenomenon in today's context, governments must prioritize addressing these health concerns to ensure the sustainable development of cities and the well-being of their citizens. By doing so, they can mitigate the negative effects of urbanization and create a healthier environment for city residents.

It surrounds us everywhere, shaping our perceptions and experiences. However, the significance of art education in schools is a topic of debate. Some individuals view art classes as a waste of time, arguing that the focus should be on science subjects. On the other hand, many believe that art lessons are just as crucial as math, science, and language classes. This article aims to provide a comprehensive explanation of why teaching art to children in school is essential.There is a common notion that the core subjects of reading, writing, and mathematics are the most critical areas for children to focus on during their school years, and this idea has some merit. Nevertheless, subjects like art, music, and poetry also play a vital role in our lives. For instance, scientists argue that art can reveal a child's creativity, enabling teachers to identify talented students. Moreover, children express themselves differently, with some finding art to be a more effective medium for conveying their feelings. This not only aids teachers and parents in better understanding their children but also helps build the child's confidence during their studies.In conclusion, while some parents may believe that the primary purpose of sending their children to school is to learn fundamental skills like reading, writing, math, and science, it is essential to recognize the value of allocating time to other subjects, such as art. By doing so, we can help children discover and utilize their inherent skills, fostering a more well-rounded education that acknowledges the importance of artistic expression and creativity.

I strongly disagree with this opinion. I think that state policy cannot lead to the people's obesity. Moreover, I am sure that only parents are responsible for their children diseases.First of all, it is important to say that government's actions can not be followed with the obesity. It is responsible only for control that all available products are not dangerous for people's health. Food that consist of a lot of fats do not put your health under the threat after the first consumption. Only overeating of this kind of food can be harmful for your health leading obesity. For instance, there is no government's responsibility if you go to the mall and buy 6 cans of beer providing health problem for yourself. I am sure that government is responsible only for making 1 can of beer acceptable for your health.Secondly, children's actions and potential consequences of these actions should be controlled by their parents. Obesity can be a result of a permanent overeating. Because of their age, chilldren cannot control themselves. That is why this responsibility goes on their parents. As it was mentioned before, there is no product that can be harmful for the healh after the first and the only consumption. There is no reason to condemn government because of the permanent consumption of any products. For example, child could eat 3 pieces of cake insted of 1 just because of his wish. In this case, his parents should stop him after the first one to avoid potential obesity.In conclusion, I would like to say that I do not see any reasons to say that government is responsible for the rise in obesity in children. It has no responsibility for people's overeating and lack of parents' control over their children.;"The notion that the government is accountable for the growing obesity rate in children is a prevailing belief. However, I strongly disagree with this stance. In my opinion, government policies cannot be held responsible for the obesity epidemic. Instead, I firmly believe that parents are solely accountable for their children's health issues, including obesity.Firstly, it is crucial to acknowledge that government actions do not directly contribute to obesity. The government's primary role is to ensure that all available products are safe for consumption and do not pose an immediate threat to public health. Foods high in fat do not become harmful until they are consumed excessively, leading to obesity. For instance, if an individual chooses to purchase multiple cans of beer, which can lead to health problems, it is not the government's responsibility. The government's duty is to regulate the safety of a single can of beer, not the individual's decision to overconsume.Secondly, it is the parents' responsibility to monitor their children's actions and the potential consequences of those actions. Obesity is often the result of persistent overeating, a behavior that children, due to their age, cannot control themselves. Therefore, it is the parents' duty to oversee and regulate their children's eating habits. As previously mentioned, no product is harmful after the first consumption; harm arises from repeated overconsumption. There is no justification for blaming the government for the prolonged consumption of any product. For example, if a child wishes to eat multiple pieces of cake, it is the parents' role to intervene after the first piece to prevent potential obesity.In conclusion, I see no reason to attribute the rise in childhood obesity to government responsibility. The government has no control over individuals' overeating habits or the lack of parental supervision over children's dietary choices. Ultimately, parents bear the responsibility for ensuring their children's healthy eating habits and preventing obesity."

For example, like swiming, the sport is well-known for beauty body buidling, many reaserch show that water pressure form muscle into more dynamic beautiful shape than any other sport regardless of safty issues which part of events were practice in open water.Compare to swiming, a group sport like soccer game need 22 players participate into the field. Average soccer player have very powerful core strenth, in order to compete in this match, soccer player need to wear certain protection to prevent from injury such as foot pad to reduce the impact from side kick from other players and ankel protector. Undoubtly, soccer players have most strong body among many sports. However, they are the group of people most likely get injuryed more frequently.Sport also can build trust and friendship between people. In this aspect, both individual sports and group sports are proven that partipating in group games or competing with another player on a 1v1 match can increase the improvement of sportsmanship between people. Like olympic motto, ""stonger, faster and higher"", a good sport can bring people together and compete each other in a fair and friendly enviornment. However, individual sport may get boring faster than group sports due to lack of competition.In conclusion, neither group sports nor individual sports are perfect in every aspects. It is important to found a sport suit for each individual personal interest. All kinds of sports always carry benifits with dangerous if people do not do it well.";"There are numerous benefits to both group and individual sports, and many people argue that one is superior to the other. Through an analysis of my personal experience, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of both types of sports.Health is a primary factor that motivates people to engage in sports to some extent. Many sports help increase metabolism and maintain a slim figure. For example, swimming is renowned for its ability to build a beautiful and dynamic physique. Research has shown that the water pressure in swimming helps to form muscles into a more toned and aesthetically pleasing shape than any other sport, regardless of safety concerns associated with open-water events.In comparison to swimming, a group sport like soccer requires 22 players to participate on the field. The average soccer player possesses powerful core strength, and to compete in a match, they need to wear protective gear, such as foot pads and ankle protectors, to prevent injuries from collisions with other players. Undoubtedly, soccer players have some of the strongest bodies among all sports. However, they are also the group most likely to get injured frequently.Sports can also foster trust and friendship between people. In this aspect, both individual and group sports have proven that participating in team games or competing against another player in a one-on-one match can improve sportsmanship between individuals. Like the Olympic motto, ""stronger, faster, and higher,"" a good sport can bring people together to compete with each other in a fair and friendly environment. However, individual sports may become boring faster than group sports due to the lack of competition.In conclusion, neither group sports nor individual sports are perfect in every aspect. It is essential to find a sport that suits each individual's personal interests. All types of sports carry benefits, but also pose dangers if not performed properly. Ultimately, the key to enjoying and benefiting from sports is to find an activity that aligns with one's interests and to practice it safely and responsibly."
189;Write about the following topic.Some people think that we should divide students based on their academic ability, while others think we should educate all students together. Discuss both views and give your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some people argue that students who have noticeable abilities and nice educational skills in academics should be separated during the learning process. The other says that it is no object who a better in education who not they should study together. I believe that it is terrible idea to include separation among students.On the one hand, when students with strong and weak academic abilities educate separately, teachers could control the learning process more thoroughly. In this way the teacher could give them more difficult tasks and focus on really relevant topics. A good example of this are private schools with fees and entering exams. It is the fact that there students in final classes have better knowledge than in common schools.On the other hand, when students with different skills educate together the strong students will help weak ones. In these classes there are standards and all students should follow them and there are opportunities to ask schoolmates how to solve some task correctly. The nice example of this is my school. If I did not know how to solve a task I would have a chance to wait for help from my more wise mate.In conclusion, although separate education will give a chance to learn a lot of difficult tasks and it helps teachers, the losing way of asking help if you do not know how to solve the task would be devastating for the educational process. In addition, it could be separated by abilities and wisdom, anyway it is an awful idea.;The debate about whether students with varying academic abilities should be separated or taught together has sparked intense discussion. While some argue that students with exceptional abilities and strong educational backgrounds should be taught separately, others claim that it is unnecessary to segregate students based on their academic prowess. I firmly believe that separating students is a misguided approach.On one hand, segregating students with strong and weak academic abilities can allow teachers to tailor the learning process more effectively. By teaching students with similar abilities separately, instructors can assign more challenging tasks and focus on relevant topics. Private schools, which often have entrance exams and tuition fees, serve as a prime example of this approach. It is indeed true that students in these institutions often demonstrate superior knowledge compared to their counterparts in public schools.On the other hand, when students with diverse skills learn together, the more adept students can assist their less proficient peers. In inclusive classrooms, standards are established, and all students are expected to adhere to them. This setup provides opportunities for students to seek help from their more knowledgeable classmates when faced with challenging tasks. My own school is a testament to the benefits of this approach. If I encountered difficulties with a task, I could rely on my more experienced classmates to provide guidance.In conclusion, although separate education may offer the advantage of tackling more complex tasks and facilitating teachers' work, the loss of opportunities for peer-to-peer learning and assistance would be detrimental to the educational process. Furthermore, even if separation were based on ability and wisdom, it would still be a flawed concept. Ultimately, I believe that inclusive education, where students of varying abilities learn together, is the more beneficial approach.
569;Write about the following topic.Some teachers think that international student exchange would be beneficial for all teenage school students.Do you think its advantages will outweigh the disadvantages?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The international student exchange is getting more popular in many high schools in big cities. This operation brings many advantages which would be beneficial for teenager students. Though, here some disadvantages still exist.Firstly, I think one of disadvantages is that lack of supervision on the international exchange teenagers as they are living in other countries. In general speaking, the youths felt strange and inadaptable at initial period. They can’t speak well foreign language, can’t communicate well with other classmates or teachers, so they might feel alone and isolate from a new circumstance. If they can’t adjust themselves well to fit in with groups as soon as possible, they will encounter more difficult things, such as studying, social and daily routine. The worse situation is that they might give up their studying, even they will mislead them into crime.On the contrary, the advantages are far more than disadvantages. For example, youths will extend their horizons. They will see and know many new things what they never seen in domestic. They would easily accept those new things than adults, because youths have curiosities all long. Furthermore, the teenagers easier to make new friends in other countries, because they are always passion and single-minded. In order to communicate with different background students from all over the world, they must cultivate their social capacities harder than before. It is the best way to elevate their skills of the foreign language is communication. Moreover, through the different viewpoint collisions the international exchange students have gained multiple and scientific logics, which will have a profound impact at the rest their lives. However, I think the simplest advantage is that most the international exchange students have possessed with an excellent foreign language ability after then come back.At the end of my essay, I think it is not suit for all teenagers to be the international exchange students. Here the teenagers must accept some selection processes under the fair and effective principles.;The international student exchange program is gaining popularity in many high schools in urban areas, offering numerous benefits to teenage students. However, despite these advantages, some drawbacks still exist.One of the main disadvantages is the lack of supervision over international exchange students living in foreign countries. Initially, these young individuals often feel strange and struggle to adapt to their new surroundings. Language barriers and difficulties in communicating with classmates and teachers can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation. If they fail to adjust quickly, they may encounter challenges in their studies, social life, and daily routines, which could ultimately lead to them abandoning their studies or even getting involved in criminal activities.On the other hand, the advantages of international student exchange programs far outweigh the disadvantages. For instance, participating students can broaden their horizons, discovering new things they never encountered in their home country. Youths, being naturally curious, are more receptive to new experiences than adults. Moreover, teenagers tend to make new friends easily in foreign countries due to their passionate and open-minded nature. To communicate with students from diverse backgrounds, they must develop their social skills, which in turn enhances their foreign language abilities through practice. The exchange program also exposes students to different perspectives, fostering multiple and logical thinking, which can have a profound impact on their lives. Perhaps the most significant advantage is that most international exchange students return home with exceptional foreign language skills.In conclusion, I believe that not all teenagers are suited for international exchange programs. Therefore, a fair and effective selection process should be in place to choose the most eligible students for this experience.

From my perspective, such a trend contains much benefits and it is undoubtedly a positive development.On the one hand, people can have more access to their interested expertise and delve into related fields with the help of online courses offered by universities. It is comparatively hard and inconvenient for people to attend courses in the university if they are not college students. Luckily, with myriads of online courses which are usually free and of high quality, learners merely need to register and sign in to find out some interesting courses ranging from academic knowledge to practical skills, which can afford a challenging but exciting experience for those attend the lessons.On the other hand, it is a good way for the universities to improve the quality of the courses as well as make some adaptation to the content of the courses. In order for people outside the universities to acquire knowldege effectively, online courses should cater to people's preference to some extent. It is expectable that some courses which is of great necessity and closely connected with people's daily life would be popular. Thus, universities would therefore release more high-quality courses by innovating teaching skills to meet people's needs.In conlusion, I think online courses provided by universities can surely make a positive impact on society because people who have the desire to acquire knowledge can enjoy sufficient resources without boundaries, which enhances individual's rights to grasp knowledge and facilitates the improvement of higher education in the long run.;The trend of universities offering online courses has become increasingly popular, allowing people to acquire knowledge through the internet and making valuable resources more accessible.

531;Write about the following topic.The issue of gay marriage remains controversial. Some people think that this trend has adverse effects on the society while others believe that it is seen as a natural trend and right for people to choose this type of marriage. Should gay marriage be legal?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Recently, many countries have legalized gay marriage. However, there are many people who do not agree with that, and claim that it has a bad influence on the education of children, and the evolution of society. However, in my opinion, I think it is a good opportunity for homosexual people as they are now understood by others, and have the right to have children despite of their situation.To begin, there are many parents, for example, who tend to believe that because of the access to gay marriage, their children will find it normal to fall in love with a person from the same sex. As a result, more and more children will become homosexual, which is unconventional as far as the parents are concerned. However, I believe that it is not because children understand the fact that being gay is normal, that they will be influenced by this. In fact, they will be able to compassionate for people who struggle to express their homosexuality, so they will help them to feel more comfortable with that. Moreover, they will be more open-minded which is very important for children development.Secondly, many other people are convinced that gay marriage will inevitably tends towards a decrease of the young population as gay individuals can not have their own kids. As a consequence, This phenomenon represents a threat because young people will not be able to take over for the future. However, I am not of this opinion. I think that such a decrease in young people population will not occur as the vast majority of the world's population in not homosexual. Moreover, by allowing gay marriage, gay couples will be able to adopt children. Indeed, due to the fact that they are not able to give rise to new-born, they can adopt children who are abandonned, and give them the opportunity to live in a new family with good conditions.To conclude, I firmly believe that gay marriage is a good opportunity for the development of the society. Indeed, not only it makes children more open-minded, which is important for their own development, but also gives for those who are unfortunately abandonned, a safe environment to thrive in.;In recent years, numerous countries have taken the significant step of legalizing gay marriage. However, not everyone agrees with this development, arguing that it negatively impacts children's education and societal evolution. From my perspective, I believe that legalizing gay marriage presents a positive opportunity for homosexual individuals, as it fosters understanding and acceptance from others and grants them the right to start a family despite their sexual orientation.Firstly, some parents are concerned that the legalization of gay marriage will make their children more likely to consider same-sex relationships as normal, potentially leading to an increase in the number of homosexual children. In their view, this is unconventional and undesirable. Nevertheless, I disagree with this assessment. I think that children who grow up understanding that being gay is a normal part of human diversity will be more compassionate towards individuals who struggle with their homosexuality, making them feel more at ease with themselves. Furthermore, this understanding will contribute to the children's open-mindedness, a crucial aspect of their development.Secondly, many believe that gay marriage will lead to a decline in the young population, as gay couples cannot biologically have children of their own. They see this as a threat to the future, as fewer young people would be available to take over. However, I do not subscribe to this opinion. The vast majority of the world's population is not homosexual, so it is unlikely that legalizing gay marriage would significantly impact population growth. Moreover, by allowing gay marriage, gay couples can adopt children who have been abandoned, providing them with a loving family and a stable environment. This not only gives these children a second chance at a happy life but also allows gay couples to experience parenthood.In conclusion, I firmly believe that gay marriage is beneficial for societal development. It not only helps children become more open-minded and accepting, which is crucial for their development, but also provides abandoned children with a safe and nurturing environment to grow and thrive in. By embracing diversity and extending rights to all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, we strengthen the fabric of our society and ensure a more inclusive and compassionate future for all.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Many today have come to the conclusion that the most significant effect on people of music is to relieve stress. While I agree that music also has more important positive functions other than reducing stress.On the one hand, I have to admit that music is a good way to reduce stress and it do plays an important role in our daily life. A good example of this can be seen in Shanghai, where has a large number of single karaoke rooms in the office buildings. As we all know, compared to the others cities in China, the people living in Shanghai face more stress, like the surprisingly high price of house and the fierce competition of work. Those public karaoke rooms, which were provided by the government for the public, become a good place for people to enjoy the music and have fun.On the other hand, for many people, music is an ideal career to persue in their life, like the job as an accountant, which can bring them with incomes and improve their living standard. For example, the TV programs related to music attract more and more people to participate in, like The Voice. Most of the participants wish to show their excellent peformance in music through these stages with the purpose of having access to more business opportunities and making more money at the same time. It is undeniable that the following income would be exponential increased than before if they succeed finally.In conclusion, it is not doubt that music is very essential for us, not only for its spiritual meanings, but also for its more important role in our society which could allow the person to relise their dream while creating more economical benefits.;Many people believe that the most significant impact of music on individuals is its ability to alleviate stress. While I concur that music has a role in stress reduction, I also think it has more profound and positive functions beyond that.On one hand, I acknowledge that music is an effective stress-reliever and plays a vital role in our daily lives. A notable example can be seen in Shanghai, where numerous single karaoke rooms are available in office buildings. As one of the most stressful cities in China, with exorbitant housing prices and intense workplace competition, these public karaoke rooms, provided by the government, offer a popular outlet for people to enjoy music and unwind.On the other hand, for many, music is an ideal career path, offering a means to earn a living and improve one's standard of life, much like a career in accounting. For instance, TV programs centered around music, such as The Voice, attract an increasing number of participants seeking to showcase their musical talents. These individuals aim to access more business opportunities and increase their earnings through successful performances. It is undeniable that their income would substantially rise if they succeed.In conclusion, it is clear that music is essential to us, not just for its emotional and spiritual significance, but also for its pivotal role in society, enabling individuals to pursue their dreams while generating economic benefits.
925;Write about the following topic.The only way to reduce the amount of traffic in cities today is by reducing the need for people to travel from home for work, education or shopping.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Traffic in cities is now a major public health problem. Finding solutions to reduce traffic is very crucial. I totally agree that if people travel less from home to work or to education or even for shopping can reduce the amount of traffic. With the covid 19 outbreak pandemic we saw how much the working from home and using the zoom application for studying reduced the traffic in cities. People now are using online for shopping too. We know that traffic can be reduced if less consumers are using the roads. However, I dont agree that this is the only way to reduce traffic. Other strategies to reduce traffic are :1. Planning the roads and building the road bridges in a smarter way with special lanes for public transportation.2. Encourging people to use light trails, public transportations and to use car pools.3. Building special lanes for motorcycles and electric bikes.4. The governoment can put more regulations regarding how many cars each family can have.5. Increasing the vehicles prices and reduce the public transportation tickets.6. Educate people on the consequences of traffic and how it can inadverntly affect their life.7. Encourge people to walk more and to choose a work that is close to your home.As I mentioned above there are many strategies that can help in reducing tranffic and only by reducing the need for people to travel from home. I think i people travel less it abviously can reduce the traffic but we need a multi strategy with the collaberations of many sectors to successfly reduce traffic in cities.;Traffic congestion in urban areas has become a significant public health concern, and finding effective solutions to mitigate it is essential. I concur that reducing the need for people to commute to work, school, or shopping can lead to a decrease in traffic volume. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the potential benefits of remote work and online learning, as evidenced by the reduced traffic in cities during this period. Moreover, the rise of online shopping has also contributed to lower traffic volumes. It is clear that minimizing the number of consumers on the roads can help alleviate traffic congestion.However, I disagree that solely reducing the need for travel is the only way to address this issue. There are multiple strategies that can be employed to reduce traffic, including:1. Intelligent road planning and construction, incorporating dedicated lanes for public transportation and optimized road bridges.2. Encouraging the use of light rail, public transportation, and carpooling to reduce the number of vehicles on the road.3. Designating special lanes for motorcycles and electric bikes to promote alternative modes of transportation.4. Implementing regulations on the number of cars allowed per household to curb excessive vehicle ownership.5. Increasing vehicle prices while reducing public transportation fares to incentivize the use of shared transportation.6. Educating the public about the consequences of traffic congestion and its unintended effects on daily life.7. Promoting walking and encouraging individuals to choose workplaces or residences that are in close proximity to reduce the need for lengthy commutes.As outlined above, there are numerous strategies that can contribute to reducing traffic congestion. While reducing the need for travel can certainly help alleviate traffic, it is crucial to adopt a multi-faceted approach that involves collaboration among various sectors to effectively mitigate traffic in urban areas.
235;Write about the following topic.There are several factors that motivate people to stay in the workforce, and money is the most important reason/factor. To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;The topic of motivation for work has merely failed to be discussed. Someone elaborate that the most significant factor is money while others suppose it is not. As far as I am concerned, although money is of great importance, it cannot always be the most valuable one.Undoubtedly, money can be a crucial factor to diminish the financial burden of families, especially for those who were born in a poverty-stricken area. To be more specific, only by earning sufficient money can they raise their later generations and keep the elderly. Provided that they cannot find a decent job that allow them to own some disposable money, it would add insult to injury.However, there are a great number of factors that may be considered as worthwhile to be the motivation of stay in the staff by some people. First of all, being in the workforce can help to strengthen an individual’s interpersonal skills. It is widely acknowledged that there are a colossal number of activities as well as team programmes that require people to collaborate, compromise and compete with the others. Thus, individuals will tend to learn some social skills and become gregarious and sociable, which can help them better adapt themselves to the mainstream society. In addition, people may also get a chance to broaden their horizons and lay a firm basis for future development by staying in the workforce. For instance, under the circumstance that numerous companies may provide the staff with the opportunity to go abroad and get involved in some international programs, people are able to get access to different cultures. As a result, people can develop panning-for-gold thinking rather than sponge-feeding thinking in the process of understanding divergent cultures, which can be beneficial for their future careers.In conclusion, although money is valuable for individuals to be in the workforce, there are many other factors that cannot be overlooked. Only by treating all the factors rationally can we enjoy the pleasure rather than pressure.;The concept of motivation for working has sparked a significant debate, with some arguing that money is the primary driver, while others disagree. In my opinion, although money is undeniably important, it is not always the most valuable motivator.Money is, without a doubt, a crucial factor in alleviating the financial burden on families, particularly for those from impoverished backgrounds. For them, earning a sufficient income is essential to support their families, educate their children, and care for their elderly. Without a stable job that provides a decent income, their struggles would only be exacerbated.However, there are numerous other factors that can motivate individuals to stay in the workforce. Firstly, being employed can help strengthen one's interpersonal skills. The workplace offers a multitude of activities and team programs that require collaboration, compromise, and competition, enabling individuals to develop essential social skills and become more outgoing and sociable. This, in turn, helps them integrate better into society. Moreover, staying in the workforce can provide opportunities for personal and professional growth. For instance, many companies offer staff the chance to participate in international programs, exposing them to diverse cultures and broadening their horizons. This experience can foster a more independent and innovative mindset, which can be highly beneficial for their future careers.In conclusion, while money is a significant motivator for individuals to work, it is not the only factor. By considering all the factors involved, we can transform our work experience from a source of pressure to a source of pleasure and fulfillment.
115;Write about the following topic.To meet the growing need for food to support an increasing population, a country should make use of edible insects as a food source. However, some people believe that insects are not only unhealthy but harvesting them will also negatively affect nature. What are the benefits and drawbacks of eating insects?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Some countries and culture already utilize insects as part of food source. As such, it can be relatively inexpensive to consume insects - which are often freely found in certain environments and do not take much skill to be collected, killed and consumed - as compared to the cost and manual labor involved in raising animal livestock, butchering, as well as preparing the meat for consumption. Similarly agriculture also involves consistent manual labor, and has costs associated with it, including for machinery and materials needed. However, people may be against the idea of consuming insects due to the novelty of it, and they may also feel disgust around it. As the prompt states, some may find it unhealthy. Harvesting insects on purpose will also require some physical and psychological work - but the benefit here is that it may be easier than harvesting large animals or cultivating crops.I have never consumed an insect product - and my father has mentioned to me that had lived in such-and-such country, I would not be so scared of cockroaches - viewing them as a food source. He intended this to be an ironic comment, meant to comfor me somewhat due to my strong aversion to cockroaches. However, he may be correct! For individuals socialized in such a society, their aversion to roaches may be lower than mine. Hence, part of the issue here is socialization and accepting this new food norm, should it be novel to the individual and/or the country.I have tried an octopus for the first time when I was around 20 years old - as I was curious about this dish called Takoyaki, and had heard good reviews of it. It was not unpleasant to eat the ocotpus, per se, but I likely will not go back to it. All in all, new experiences, including consumption of new types of food, may create strong aversion at first, but once dip your toes into it, so to speak, it may be tamer than the experience you were expecting - even if you never go back to eating it again.;"In several countries and cultures, insects are already a common food source, making them a relatively affordable option. They can be easily collected, killed, and consumed, requiring minimal skill and labor compared to traditional animal livestock, which involves significant costs, manual labor, and resources for raising, butchering, and preparing meat. Similarly, agriculture demands consistent labor and expenses for machinery and materials. However, many people may be hesitant to consume insects due to their novelty and perceived disgust. Some may also view it as unhealthy, as the prompt suggests. Harvesting insects intentionally will require physical and psychological effort, but it may be less demanding than hunting large animals or cultivating crops. Personally, I have never tried insect-based products, but my father once jokingly commented that if I had grown up in a certain country, I wouldn't be so afraid of cockroaches, implying that I would view them as a food source. His comment was meant to comfort me, given my strong aversion to cockroaches, but it may hold some truth. Individuals socialized in societies where entomophagy (the practice of eating insects) is common may have a lower aversion to insects like roaches. This highlights the role of socialization in accepting new food norms, especially when they are unfamiliar to the individual or their country.I recall trying octopus for the first time in my early twenties, driven by curiosity about the dish Takoyaki and positive reviews. While eating the octopus wasn't unpleasant, I don't plan to repeat the experience. This anecdote illustrates that trying new foods, especially those that are unconventional, can initially create strong aversions. However, taking the first step and ""dipping your toes"" into such experiences can make them less intimidating than expected, even if you don't end up enjoying them or returning to them."

So they could contributed more for any pension plan or those kind of program. We need to guarantee that our next governants will be capable to redesign the retire's program in an way to guarantee those beneffits to whole population.Looking by a health care perspective, all the improvments and medicine advance, it brings the possibilite to have a good life even allthough the years.For instance, we can see many people that healed from a bad ill like cancer or other ones and have a good life nowadays.This is the reason that elderly people is not a problem to our society, but in fact their represents more knowledge and we have all tecnology to take care about theirselfs.In other way we can see that our society open more space and are more concern with elderly population. We can see some places speciallyzed to take care of their and also a kind of intertainement focused on them, like some hotels, restauurants, clinics.In whole way our society are looking for treaty our elderly society in a decent way, respect them, make a enviroment friendly for their deficient and any dificult of mobility and any other issue that we need to cope to guarantee their activities.;I firmly believe that advancements in healthcare not only contribute to an increase in the elderly population, but also bring numerous benefits in terms of care and support. From a financial perspective, improvements in healthcare enable people to work for a longer period, allowing them to retire later and contribute more to pension plans and similar programs. It is essential that future governments redesign retirement programs to ensure these benefits are accessible to the entire population.From a healthcare perspective, advancements in medicine and technology have made it possible for people to lead healthy and fulfilling lives, even in their later years. For example, many individuals who have overcome serious illnesses like cancer are now able to enjoy a good quality of life. This is why I do not view elderly people as a burden to society, but rather as a valuable source of knowledge and experience. With the aid of technology, we are well-equipped to provide them with the care and support they need.Moreover, our society is becoming increasingly accommodating and attentive to the needs of the elderly population. We are seeing the emergence of specialized facilities, such as hotels, restaurants, and clinics, that cater specifically to their needs. Furthermore, there is a growing trend towards creating an environment that is friendly and accessible to elderly individuals with mobility issues or other challenges, with the goal of enabling them to maintain their independence and engage in various activities.Overall, our society is striving to treat elderly individuals with dignity and respect, and to provide them with a supportive and caring environment that allows them to thrive.
933;Write about the following topic.Young people in the modern world seem to have more power and influence than any previous young generation.Why is this the case?What impact does this have on the relationship between old and young people?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;"In modern times, the younger generation appear to be more powerful and influencial compared to the generations in times past. I believe this is as a result of younger people being more ascertive, stepping up to question and change existing societal norms and archaic cultures. At first, this may negatively affect their relationship with the older generation as a result of how unfamiliar they are to these changes but subsequently, the tension is bound to resolve, when the older generations come to accept these changes.To begin with, it is an open truth that young people these days tend to be very bold and outspoken and unlike their predecessors, are better at questioning norms that do not sit right with them and even going an extra mile to change these norms or cultures. A good example of this is seen in women empowerment and rights activism. In my part of the world, some years back, it was believed that a woman's place is in the kitchen and her sole job was to birth and rear children, therefore, women were not allowed to be educated or have paying jobs. Women in the older generation complied to this because it was the norm, but this is not the case in modern times, because many young women opposed to it and now, homes are even headed by women; the power of activism.Many people in the older generation are not familiar with young people being more outspoken and this is understandable because in their time, they were taught to only follow rules and not to question them. Therefore the fact that young people have become more outspoken and powerful is foreign to them and just like every human nature, whatever is foreign or different is automatically hated. As a result, there is likely going to be a tension between the 2 generations, however, with constant advocation and learning the tension is bound to resolve. For example, going back to women's rights activism, at the start, many older people were not on board as they did not think it was normal, however, there are now a lot of older people who have become activists.In conclusion, I believe that the power and influence the younger generation has is as a result of their ascertiveness and will to effect changes in their societies and even though it may cause a negative relationship with the older generation at first, subsequently, their differences is likely to be ironed out when the older generation learns to accept these changes.";In today's world, the younger generation appears to wield more power and influence than their predecessors. This shift, in my opinion, can be attributed to the younger demographic's increased assertiveness, as they are more likely to challenge and alter existing social norms and outdated cultural practices. Initially, this may lead to tension with the older generation, who may be unfamiliar with these changes. However, as the older generation becomes more accustomed to these shifts, their differences are likely to be resolved.It is evident that contemporary young people are more outspoken and bold, often questioning and challenging norms that they disagree with. In contrast to their predecessors, they are more inclined to speak out against injustices and work towards creating positive change. A notable example of this can be seen in the women's empowerment and rights movement. In my region, it was once commonly believed that a woman's role was solely in the domestic sphere, and that they should not pursue education or paid employment. However, with the rise of young women who opposed these outdated norms, we are now seeing a shift towards greater equality, with women even heading households. This is a testament to the power of activism and the younger generation's determination to create change.The older generation's unfamiliarity with the younger demographic's outspoken nature is understandable, given that they were taught to follow rules without question. Consequently, the idea of young people being more vocal and influential may seem foreign and even be met with resistance. This resistance can lead to tension between the two generations, as people often naturally reject what they do not understand. Nevertheless, through continued advocacy and education, these differences can be ironed out. For instance, the women's rights movement, which was initially met with skepticism by some older individuals, has now gained support from many in the older generation, who have become advocates themselves.In conclusion, I firmly believe that the younger generation's power and influence stems from their willingness to challenge the status quo and effect meaningful change in their societies. Although this may initially lead to friction with the older generation, as the latter becomes more accepting of these changes, their differences are likely to be resolved, ultimately leading to a more harmonious and progressive society.
351;Write about the following topic:In many countries, not enough students study science subjects. What are the causes? What will be the effect on society?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Nowadays, there are many courses available to take, from arts that include theatre and music to scientific topics such as mathemathics, physics, chemistry, biology and medicine. There is an evidence that the amount of students willing to learn science subjects is not sufficient. In this essay I will discuss the causes of the issue and the possible effect on society.There are several casues for the fact that students tend to skip science subjects. First, studying science can be hard and exhausting. The complexity of some subjects such as math and physics requires from the student to study many hours at home. Secondly, there are students who do not only find those courses difficult, but also get low marks even after studying long hours. As for chemistry classes, some courses include labratory lessons which may not appeal to some students.The importance of people having knowledge in science is great. The society relies on science on a daily basis. For instance, doctors who study medicine, must know mathematics, biology and chemistry well, because biology is relevant to the patient's body. In addition, doctors prescribe medications so they must know chemistry well. Another example is architects whose job is to plan and design buildings. Without a proper knowledge in physics, they could not plan buildings.Discussing those facts, studying science can be challenging. However, it is vital for the society that students will study science. Without doctors, nurses, scientists and other professions that rely on science, the health of the society might be effected negatively.;In today's educational landscape, a wide range of courses are available, spanning from arts such as theatre and music to science disciplines including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine. However, there is evidence suggesting that the number of students interested in pursuing science subjects is inadequate. This essay aims to explore the underlying causes of this issue and its potential impact on society.Several factors contribute to the tendency of students to avoid science subjects. Firstly, the study of science can be demanding and exhausting. The complexity of certain subjects, such as mathematics and physics, requires students to dedicate numerous hours to studying outside the classroom. Secondly, some students not only find these courses challenging but also struggle to achieve satisfactory grades despite extensive studying. Furthermore, chemistry classes often include laboratory sessions, which may not appeal to all students due to their hands-on and sometimes unpredictable nature.The significance of having a populace with a strong foundation in science cannot be overstated. Society depends on scientific knowledge in its daily functioning. For instance, medical professionals, such as doctors, must have a solid grasp of mathematics, biology, and chemistry to effectively understand human physiology and prescribe appropriate medications, highlighting the interdependence of these sciences in medical practice. Similarly, architects, whose role involves planning and designing buildings, require a profound understanding of physics to ensure the structural integrity and safety of their designs.In conclusion, while studying science can be challenging, it is essential for societal well-being that students pursue science education. The absence of critical professions such as doctors, nurses, scientists, and other roles that rely heavily on science could have detrimental effects on public health. Therefore, it is imperative to address the causes of the declining interest in science subjects among students and to foster an environment that encourages and supports the study of science, recognizing its vital role in the advancement and health of society.
1185;Write about the following topic:Rich countries often give money to poorer countries, but it does not solve poverty. Therefore, developed countries should give other types of help to the poor countries rather than financial aid.To what extent do you agree or disagree?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Poverty has been always a major issue around the world. Due to viruses, natural disasters, and poor management in the country and overpopulation, each day the poverty increases. In addition, some developed countries ignore the help or just give a temporary solution. Poverty has a great effect on the income that can lead to serious problems.To begin with, developed countries shouldn't only support with financial aid, as that kind of solution will not help the people. In my opinion, rich countries can stop poverty in such way to look for the natural resources of the poor country and to help and develop its resources. For example, in Africa they are famous for their large area of land. A rich country can take this opportunity to implement a long-term plan to benefit and fight poverty, such as to start expanding the lands of agriculture to use their natural resources such as cocoa, rice, and coffee. Furthermore, this idea can also help the people of the country where they can work on the land and be employed.Also, developed countries can donate and build health care centers and schools to prevent the dangerous disease from spreading. Schools can empower children to grow up and help the country's economy to rise and to fight poverty.In conclusion, developed countries can unite and discuss this significant concern rather than helping with financial support as poverty is taking the lives of many children. Poor countries just need better solutions and understanding from the world to prevent such problems from continuing to happen.;Poverty has long been a pervasive and pressing global issue. The combination of factors such as viral outbreaks, natural disasters, mismanagement, and overpopulation contributes to its relentless escalation. Furthermore, some developed nations often provide only temporary or superficial assistance, neglecting to address the root causes of poverty. The impact of poverty on income levels can have far-reaching and severe consequences.Rather than merely offering financial aid, which provides only a temporary reprieve, developed countries should adopt a more holistic approach to combat poverty. In my view, wealthy nations can play a pivotal role in eradicating poverty by identifying and developing the natural resources of impoverished countries. For instance, Africa's vast expanses of land present a prime opportunity for investment. By implementing long-term plans to expand agricultural lands and harness resources such as cocoa, rice, and coffee, rich countries can create employment opportunities for local populations and stimulate economic growth.Additionally, developed countries can make a significant difference by donating and establishing healthcare centers and educational institutions. These facilities can prevent the spread of diseases and empower children through education, ultimately contributing to the country's economic development and poverty reduction. Educated children are more likely to grow into productive citizens who can help elevate their nation's economy and break the cycle of poverty.In conclusion, it is imperative that developed countries come together to discuss and address this critical issue, moving beyond mere financial support. Poverty claims the lives of countless children and perpetuates a cycle of hardship. What impoverished nations need are thoughtful, sustainable solutions and a deeper understanding from the global community to prevent these problems from persisting. By working together and adopting a more comprehensive approach, we can make meaningful strides in the fight against poverty.
343;Write about the following topic:Some people believe that it is important to spend a lot of money on family celebrations. While others think it is a waste of money. Discuss both views.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Spending money in family celebrations can be seen as a way of appreciating where one comes from. Although some people say it is a total waste of money, l assert that it is wiser.To begin with, many people feel that it is of no importance to consume money on family gatherings. This is because people usually have more pressing issues in life like urgent health cases that require money. Also, some struggle to provide basic needs for their families, for example, tuitions, decent meals and shelter. For these reasons, it seems using money on family gatherings is just a luxury.Despite the merits of the arguments above, although many say it is wasteful to financially cater for family parties, l assert that it is crucial. One reason is that, it unites families and a sweet spirit is maintained if family members are recognised for their special days such as wedding anniversaries, birthdays and graduations where money is spent. Further, appreciation to others within the family cannot be expressed in many ways without forking out some money.Furthermore, money has to be spent on family get togethers where everyone is in a joyous mood so that people can catch up and release stresses from their straining personal lives. What is more, culture, closeness and love is easily displayed when families come together for such celebrations and use money for their own satisfaction. For instance, when my childhood birthdays were celebrated, l felt so much loved and l still cherish the memories as l vividly can recall.To conclude, although others feel that it is money consuming to fund family gatherings, l advocate that it is a wiser option. Should this be the case, love within families would not wax cold and family members would feel more appreciated.;Spending money on family celebrations can be viewed as a way to appreciate one's heritage and show gratitude for one's roots. While some people consider it a frivolous expense, I firmly believe that it is a wise investment.Initially, many individuals may think that spending money on family gatherings is unnecessary, especially when there are more pressing concerns in life, such as medical emergencies or providing basic necessities like tuition, food, and shelter. From this perspective, using money for family celebrations seems like a luxury that can be cut back on.However, despite the validity of these arguments, I argue that spending money on family celebrations is essential. One key reason is that it brings families together and fosters a sense of unity and joy, particularly on special occasions like wedding anniversaries, birthdays, and graduations. Additionally, expressing appreciation and gratitude towards family members often requires spending money, as it is a tangible way to show love and care.Moreover, family gatherings provide an opportunity for members to come together, catch up, and unwind from the stresses of their daily lives. When families spend money on celebrations, they can showcase their culture, closeness, and love, creating lasting memories and strengthening bonds. For instance, I still cherish the memories of my childhood birthdays, which were filled with love and joy, and I vividly recall the special moments we shared as a family.In conclusion, although some people may view spending money on family gatherings as a waste, I strongly advocate for its importance. By investing in family celebrations, love and appreciation within families can flourish, and family members can feel valued and cherished.
1199;Write about the following topic:Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults.Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Is competition instructive or toxic for children? There is a debate around this topic. There are those who believe that a sense of competition should be supported. On the other standpoint, there are those who believe that rather that compete children have to learn how to co-operate. I believe that supporters of competicions are partly right but also that co-operation between children is essential. The two strategy can be taken together to give to childrens all the tools they need to became useful adults.On the one hand, there are people who believe that to compete is essential for the growth of children. They believe that competitions rise the ambitions of children. They develop certain attitudes thanks to which they will have always bigger dreams and desire. The idea, therefore, is that children who have grown making competiions will became important managers because of their instinctive desire to be winners and successful persons. It is true that competitions permit childrens to develop their ambitions and to do the best they can in order to win. However, I strongly believe that a good understanding of the aim of competitions should be taught before they start to compete. Indeed, children have to understand the instructive role of competition and how manage the possible distructive consequences that could derive if a child is not ready to lose. Children should start a competition being aware of the possibility of lose and the possibility to win. I believe that is important to stimulate children in doing competitions but teaching them the important role of defeats and the role of coperation. This lead me to analyse the second standpoint.There are, indeed, people who dislike competitions at all. They believe they are toxic for the growth of children. According to them, it is negative to teach children to be against between each other. Rather, children should learn how to work together and co-operate. Surely, co-operation is a vital skill in workplaces. The ability to work in team is one of the most searched by different businesses. To learn how to work together means for children to understand their role in a group and also to think about the ideas that should support the team itself. Co-operation then permits children to develop fundamental social skills. However, co-operation alone is not enough for children's instruction. I believe that co-operation is possible just if a child is also learning how to work and produce something alone. Children, in order to advances ideas and give a good support in a team, have to learn to be ambitious and this is possible thanks to competitions.In conclusion, I believe that an instruction in which single competitions as well as team-works are encouraged is the most useful and productive in order to grow up efficient adults.;The question of whether competition is beneficial or detrimental to children's development has sparked a heated debate. On one hand, some argue that fostering a competitive spirit is essential, while others believe that cooperation should be the primary focus. I concur with both perspectives to some extent, and I firmly believe that a balanced approach, combining the benefits of competition and cooperation, is crucial in providing children with the necessary tools to become successful adults.Proponents of competition argue that it is vital for children's growth, as it fuels their ambition and encourages them to strive for excellence. By participating in competitions, children develop a strong desire to succeed and become winners, which can ultimately lead to their success as leaders and managers. However, I strongly advocate for teaching children the value and purpose of competition before they begin to participate. It is essential for them to understand that competition is not only about winning but also about learning from defeats and the importance of cooperation. By acknowledging the possibility of both winning and losing, children can develop a healthy competitive spirit while also learning to work together and support one another.On the other hand, there are those who believe that competitions are toxic and detrimental to children's development. They argue that pitting children against each other can be negative and that cooperation should be the primary focus. Indeed, cooperation is a vital skill in the workplace, and the ability to work in a team is highly valued by businesses. By learning to work together, children can develop essential social skills, such as understanding their role within a group and contributing to the team's success. Nevertheless, I believe that cooperation alone is insufficient for a child's education. Children must also learn to work independently and develop their ambitions, which can be fostered through competitions.In conclusion, I firmly believe that an educational approach that encourages both individual competitions and teamwork is the most effective and productive way to raise capable and successful adults. By striking a balance between competition and cooperation, children can develop the necessary skills to excel in their future careers, including ambition, teamwork, and social skills. Ultimately, a well-rounded education that incorporates both competitive and cooperative elements is essential for children to become confident, successful, and valuable members of society.
397;Write about the following topic:Some people think that hosting an international sports event is good for the country, while some people think it is bad. Discuss both views and state your opinion.Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;International sports events are one of the most trendy interactions at any hosting country. Depending on the hoster, the events could represent a virtue or a slip. This dependence is associated with the costs, logisitcs, marketing, etc. I tend to be of the opinion, that the virtues outweigh the disadvantages and that they shall be considered as opportunities to exploit.Some people think of the international sport events as being disadvantageous, because for example of being a pressure on the countries' infrastructure as well as the provided services and facilities. Another reason might emerge as some countries also might not be well-suited for such events. For instance, despite spending a big budget on the organisation of the event, the lack of qualified personnel or needed objects and materials shall cause a massive distruction of the hostees' experiences.The other perpective of the usages and utilization of such events could be clear through the massive amount of virtues, which these events normally brings to the hosting countries. For example, these events are regularly sponsored from international organisation, which provide the financial means not for only the logisitcs of the events, but additionally fees for the hosters. Furthermore, the financial benefits shall not stop by the provided fees through the owning organisation, but also the global or regional branding of such country will affect the tourism and the local service providers absolutely positive.Concluding, international sport events could be absolutely virtous, if the hosting countries were to implement their strategies successfully. Should such countries be willing to give the event the raw focus on the organisation and the user-experience, that would absolutely lead to massive benefits financially, marketing-wise and from intercultural perspective.;International sports events are a highly significant and trendy occurrence in any host country. The success of these events depends on the host country's capabilities, including costs, logistics, marketing, and more. In my opinion, the benefits of hosting international sports events far outweigh the drawbacks, and they should be viewed as opportunities to be leveraged.Some people argue that hosting international sports events can be detrimental, as they can put a strain on a country's infrastructure, services, and facilities. Additionally, some countries may not be well-equipped to host such events, and despite investing heavily in organization, a lack of qualified personnel, resources, and materials can lead to a disappointing experience for attendees.However, the numerous benefits of hosting international sports events are clear. For instance, these events are often sponsored by international organizations, which provide financial support for logistics, as well as additional fees for the host country. The financial benefits extend beyond the initial funding, as the global and regional branding of the host country can have a profoundly positive impact on tourism and local service providers.In conclusion, international sports events can be highly beneficial if the host country implements its strategies successfully. By focusing on organization and user experience, host countries can reap significant financial, marketing, and intercultural benefits. With careful planning and execution, international sports events can be a valuable opportunity for host countries to showcase their capabilities and reap long-term rewards.
1412;You can get up-to-date news from the radio, TV and the Internet. Which kind of media do you think is the best to get the news?;Nowadays, there are several channels to get news, such as the radio, TV, newspapers and the Internet. I think the Internet is the best among these. .Since its invention, the Internet has been booming as a prospective industry. Not only because it is a combination of text, audio and video, but also due to its . It has threatened the domination of spreading news of the traditional media, and, I would say, is about to take control.We can find everything we want on the Internet – the latest news, books, songs, movies, cartoons… . With the radio, we can merely hear. Compared to a newspaper, the radio and TV can provide the latest information. For instance the breaking news of the Americans’ attacking Iraq was immediately online, as well as that the Twin Towers of New York were destroyed on September 11, 2001. However, we just cannot .The Internet is a way of getting information, as long as your mobile phone is connected or you possess a laptop. When I am a vehicle, I usually have my cellphone connected to the Internet, then browse through what in the past few hours, or log in MSN to begin a conversation with my friends. Reading a newspaper is also a good way to kill time, but for me, a youngster, it is not so modern as “surfing online while commuting”.The traditional media will never disappear, though the Internet has taken a big advantage the competition. And definitely, there is still a long way for the Internet to go. , the Internet benefits me the most, and I highly appreciate it.;In today's digital age, we have multiple sources to access news, including radio, television, newspapers, and the internet. Among these, I firmly believe that the internet stands out as the most superior option. Since its inception, the internet has experienced exponential growth as a promising industry, not only because it combines text, audio, and video, but also due to its unparalleled accessibility and versatility. This has significantly challenged the traditional dominance of news dissemination by conventional media outlets, and I assert that it is on the verge of surpassing them.The internet offers an exhaustive array of information, from the latest news to books, music, movies, cartoons, and beyond. In contrast, radio only provides audio content. Although television and radio can offer real-time updates, surpassing newspapers in this aspect, the internet outdoes them by providing instantaneous access to breaking news. For instance, news of significant events like the American attack on Iraq or the destruction of the Twin Towers in New York on September 11, 2001, was immediately available online.The internet serves as an omnipresent source of information, accessible as long as one has a mobile phone or a laptop with an internet connection. Even when commuting, I can stay updated on current events or communicate with friends via my cellphone's internet connection. While reading newspapers can be a viable way to pass time, for someone of my generation, it lacks the modern appeal of browsing the internet on-the-go.Despite the internet's rapid ascent, traditional media will endure, albeit with a diminished competitive edge. The internet still has a considerable journey ahead in terms of development and expansion. Personally, the internet offers me the most benefits, and I deeply appreciate its convenience and wealth of information.
1377;should children grow up in the city or countryside (advantages/disadvantages)?;Some people think it is better for children to grown up in the city, while others think that life in the countryside is more suitable for them. What are the advantages and disadvantages of both places?Living in the rural area is the best option for children by a group of people, while others believe that cities offer more opportunities. In my opinion, if the city offers security and green areas, I agree it is a better place to raise the next generation some advantages both sides.Firstly, the countryside in touch with nature, taking care of animals and helping with the gardening. Because of that, they learn how to protect the environment and to live without any technological equipment. Besides that, they have more freedom to play outside the house without any security worries, whereas in the city they are kept at home smartphones and computers for this reason. On the other hand, schools usually have lower quality and it is hard to find extracurricular classes. Therefore, children difficulties trying to develop their abilities besides the school curriculum.However, schools at metropolitan areas tend to have better quality and offer all kinds of activities. Even if there is a sport or an art course that the institution does not offer, it is possible to look for it in another place around the city. As a result, all children’s talents and passions can be easier to develop. On the other hand, security, pollution and contact with nature are issues that we have to worry about. The better option would be a city with an excellent quality of life where children could play in parks and gardens.To sum up, growing up in the countryside can be very positive for someone’s childhood, but the city will usually offer better opportunities for their talents’ development.This is a well written essay. It talks about all parts of the task and the arguments and ideas are extended and supported by some examples. The information is sequenced in a logical way and most of the ideas are linked using appropriate connective words. The choice of vocabulary is suitable to express the meaning of the writer, though in some instances word choice can be improved further (mouse over the words underlined in blue shows suggested corrections). Most sentences are error-free and demonstrate various levels of complexity. Overall this essay seems good enough to deserve IELTS Band 8.;The debate about whether children should be raised in the city or the countryside has sparked intense discussion. While some individuals believe that the countryside is the ideal environment for children to grow up, others argue that cities provide more opportunities for them. In my opinion, if a city can offer a secure and green environment, I agree that it is a better place to raise the next generation, as it presents various advantages on both sides.On the one hand, living in the countryside has its own set of benefits. Children can develop a close relationship with nature, learn to care for animals, and assist with gardening. This helps them understand the importance of environmental protection and how to live without relying on technological devices. Additionally, they have more freedom to play outside without worrying about security, unlike in cities where they are often confined to their homes with smartphones and computers. However, a significant drawback of rural areas is that schools often have lower quality and limited extracurricular activities, making it challenging for children to develop their skills beyond the school curriculum.On the other hand, metropolitan areas typically boast better-quality schools that offer a wide range of activities. Even if a particular sport or art course is not available at the school, children can easily find alternative institutions in the city that provide these opportunities. As a result, children's talents and passions can be more easily nurtured. Nevertheless, concerns about security, pollution, and access to natural environments are noteworthy issues. Ideally, a city with an excellent quality of life, where children can play in parks and gardens, would be the most suitable option.In conclusion, growing up in the countryside can have numerous positive aspects for a person's childhood. However, cities generally offer better opportunities for the development of children's talents. This essay effectively explores both sides of the argument, presenting well-supported ideas and examples in a logical sequence. The vocabulary choice is suitable, although some words could be improved for better expression. Most sentences are free of errors and display a range of complexity, making this essay worthy of an IELTS Band 8 score.
1379;should unpaid community work be mandatory in high school (agree/disagree)?;"Some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school programs (for example working for a charity, improving the neighborhood or teaching sports to younger children). To what extent do you agree or disagree?It is argued that voluntary services charity, cleaning the neighborhood, imparting knowledge to the underprivileged, should be made mandatory in the high school curriculum. I strongly agree as it not only helps in students becoming socially responsible adults but also in shaping their character.Firstly, community service inculcates a sense of responsibility towards the society, something that is needed to shape a good society. For instance, the introduction of Swatch Bharath scheme in my school, The Hyderabad Public School, ten years ago taught me not only to keep the surroundings of the school clean but also to never litter wherever I go. Hence, now I feel responsible to maintain cleanliness everywhere. Such services are needed to develop a better society in the future.Secondly, voluntary services cater to the overall character development of an individual. It a feeling of empathy in children which is needed to build a better character. For example, an alumnus of Montessori High School, who indulged in petty law-breaking activities during school confessed that it was the charity service that he did in high school; which in his mind; him in becoming a better person for his family and refrained him from committing socially irresponsible acts. Thus, such voluntary activities teach us to value what we have and in turn to our personality development.That being said, we cannot deny the fact that many students misuse the time allocated for these services by considering it as an excursion to enjoy with friends rather than a learning .In conclusion, although compulsory voluntary community service has its drawbacks, it is still useful in shaping a child as a socially responsible citizen and also in their overall personality development. Therefore, pupils should be encouraged to involve themselves in such activities.This is a well written essay.

917;‘Failure is proof that the desire wasn’t strong enough’To what extent do you agree with this statement?Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.;Failure is what nobody wish for, but it could occur secondarily to an unsuccessful attempt towards ones goal, for various reasons. I am in the view that, failure is not a proof of lack of desire, rather it is more to do with improper techniques, less allocation of time and lack of proper attitude.It is the general view that, ultimate success in any field is taught through the failures in life. One can be subjected to multiple failures due to lack of ability to develop essential skill set, also known as techniques, that would be essential to achieve a certain goal. One classic example is Thomas Alwa Eddison, the great inventor of all time, who went through nearly 100 unsucessfull experiments, before inventing the light bulb. He was brave enough to accept the failure experiments had taught him 100 different impossible ways not to discover the light bulb.On the other hand, time plays one of the most crucial factors in obtaining a goal/success. By this I meant, the time that is allocated towards full filling tasks that are directed towards preparing for the goal. The little time is spent during the preparation, the further away the goal felt like. For an instance, one cannot expected to win a marothon with just one day preparation.Similarly, attitude plays by far the most striking part of the success. This is simple as, one cannot dream of becoming a good physician, having shown no interest in paying attention to people and their health related complaints.In a nut shell, failure is not a proof for inadequate desire in fact, failure is due to improper practices of techniques,failure of managing time in preparing and attitudes that fires the drive.;Failure is an unwelcome outcome that can occur when attempts to achieve a goal are unsuccessful, often due to various factors. However, I believe that failure does not necessarily indicate a lack of desire or motivation. Instead, it is more likely the result of inadequate techniques, insufficient time allocation, and a poor attitude.It is widely acknowledged that ultimate success in any field is often preceded by failures, which serve as valuable learning experiences. Multiple failures can occur when one lacks the essential skills or techniques required to achieve a particular goal. A notable example is Thomas Edison, the renowned inventor, who conducted nearly 100 unsuccessful experiments before inventing the light bulb. Edison's bravery in accepting his failures allowed him to learn from them, and he famously remarked that each experiment had taught him 100 different ways not to invent the light bulb.Time allocation is also a critical factor in achieving success. The amount of time dedicated to preparing for a goal is directly correlated with the likelihood of success. Insufficient preparation time can make a goal seem unattainable. For instance, it is unrealistic to expect to win a marathon with only one day of preparation.Attitude plays a vital role in success, as it drives motivation and determination. A person's attitude towards their goal can make or break their chances of success. For example, becoming a good physician requires a genuine interest in people's health and well-being, and a willingness to dedicate time and effort to their care.In summary, failure is not a reflection of inadequate desire, but rather a result of improper techniques, poor time management, and a lackluster attitude.
